<h1>The Paedagogus (Book I)</h1>

<p><strong>(The Instructor)</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Office of the Instructor</h2>

<p>As there are these three things in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, habits, actions, and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; habits are the department appropriated by <em>hortatory</em> discourse the guide to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which, like the ship's keel, is laid beneath for the building up of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; in which, rejoicing exceedingly, and abjuring our old opinions, through <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we renew our youth, singing with the hymning <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>How good is God to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to such as are upright in heart!</q>  All actions, again, are the province of <em>preceptive</em> discourse; while <em>persuasive</em> discourse applies itself to heal the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. It is, however, one and the self-same word which rescues man from the custom of this world in which he has been reared, and trains him up in the one <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>When, then, the heavenly guide, the Word, was inviting  men to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the appellation of <em>hortatory</em> was properly applied to Him: his same word was called rousing (the whole from a part). For the whole of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is hortatory, engendering in the kindred faculty of reason a yearning after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life now and to come. But now, being at once curative and preceptive, following in His own steps, He makes what had been prescribed the subject of persuasion, promising the cure of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> within us. Let us then designate this Word appropriately by the one name <em>Tutor</em> (or <em>P&aelig;dagogue</em>, or <em>Instructor</em>).</p>

<p>The Instructor being practical, not theoretical, His aim is thus to improve the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not to teach, and to train it up to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, not to an intellectual life. Although this same word is didactic, but not in the present instance. For the word which, in matters of doctrine, explains and reveals, is that whose province it is to teach. But our Educator  being practical, first exhorts to the attainment of right dispositions and character, and then persuades us to the energetic practice of our duties, enjoining on us pure commandments, and exhibiting to such as come after representations of those who formerly wandered in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Both are of the highest utility&mdash;that which assumes the form of counselling to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and that which is presented in the form of example; which latter is of two kinds, corresponding to the former duality&mdash;the one having for its purpose that we should choose and imitate the good, and the other that we should reject and turn away from the opposite.</p>

<p>Hence accordingly ensues the healing of our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in consequence of the assuagements of those examples; the P&aelig;dagogue strengthening our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and by His benign commands, as by gentle medicines, guiding the sick to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>There is a wide difference between health and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for the latter is produced by learning, the former by healing. One, who is ill, will not therefore learn any branch of instruction till he is quite well. For neither to learners nor to the sick is each injunction invariably expressed similarly; but to the former in such a way as to lead to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to the latter to health. As, then, for those of us who are diseased in body a physician is required, so also those who are diseased in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> require a p&aelig;dagogue to cure our maladies; and then a teacher, to train and guide the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to all requisite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> when it is made able to admit the revelation of the Word. Eagerly desiring, then, to perfect us by a gradation conducive to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, suited for efficacious discipline, a beautiful arrangement is observed by the all-benignant Word, who first exhorts, then trains, and finally teaches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Our Instructor's Treatment of Our Sins</h2>

<p>Now, O you, my children, our Instructor is like His Father <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose son He is, sinless, blameless, and with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> devoid of passion; God in the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, stainless, the minister of His Father's will, the Word who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is at the Father's right hand, and with the form of God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is to us a spotless image; to Him we are to try with all our might to assimilate our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He is wholly free from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; wherefore also He alone is judge, because He alone is sinless. As far, however, as we can, let us try to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as little as possible. For nothing is so urgent in the first place as deliverance from <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and disorders, and then the checking of our liability to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that have become habitual. It is best, therefore, not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all in any way, which we assert to be the prerogative of God alone; next to keep clear of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> transgressions, which is characteristic of the wise man; thirdly, not to fall into many involuntary offenses, which is peculiar to those who have been excellently trained. Not to continue long in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, let that be ranked last. But this also is salutary to those who are called back to repentance, to renew the contest.</p>

<p>And the Instructor, as I think, very beautifully says, through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>If any one die suddenly by him, straightway the head of his consecration shall be polluted, and shall be shaved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021037"><a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse9">Numbers&nbsp;6:9</a></span> designating involuntary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as sudden death. And He says that it pollutes by defiling the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: wherefore He prescribes the cure with all speed, advising the head to be instantly shaven; that is, counselling the locks of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which shade the reason to be shorn clean off, that reason (whose seat is in the brain), being left bare of the dense stuff of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, may speed its way to repentance. Then after a few remarks He adds, <q>The days before are not reckoned irrational,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021038"><a href="../bible/num006.htm#verse12">Numbers&nbsp;6:12</a></span> by which manifestly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are meant which are contrary to reason. The involuntary act He calls <q> <em>sudden</em>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He calls <q>irrational.</q> Wherefore the Word, the Instructor, has taken the charge of us, in order to the prevention of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is contrary to reason.</p>

<p>Hence consider the expression of Scripture, <q>Therefore these things says the Lord;</q> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that had been committed before is held up to reprobation by the succeeding expression <q>therefore,</q> according to which the righteous judgment follows. This is shown conspicuously by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when they said, <q>Had you not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, He would not have uttered these threatenings.</q> <q>Therefore thus says the Lord;</q> <q>Because you have not heard these words, therefore these things the Lord;</q> and, <q>Therefore, behold, the Lord says.</q> For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is given by reason both of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and disobedience: for <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, that we may be saved; for disobedience, that we may be corrected.</p>

<p>Our Instructor, the Word, therefore cures the unnatural <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by means of exhortations. For with the highest propriety the help of bodily diseases is called the healing art&mdash; an art acquired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> skill. But the paternal Word is the only P&aelig;onian physician of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmities, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> charmer of the sick <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>Save,</q> it is said, <q>Your servant, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who trusts in You. Pity me, O Lord; for I will cry to You all the day.</q>  For a while the <q>physician's art,</q> according to Democritus, <q>heals the diseases of the body; wisdom frees the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from passion.</q> But the good Instructor, the Wisdom, the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who made man, cares for the whole nature of His creature; the all-sufficient Physician of humanity, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, heals both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>Rise up,</q> He said to the paralytic; <q>take the bed on which you lie and go away home;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021040"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse11">Mark&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and straightway the infirm man received strength. And to the dead He said, <q>Lazarus, go forth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021041"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span> and the dead man issued from his coffin such as he was before he died, having undergone resurrection. Further, He heals the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself by precepts and gifts&mdash; by precepts indeed, in course of time, but being liberal in His gifts, He says to us sinners, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021042"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;9:2</a></span> </p>

<p>We, however, as soon as He conceived the thought, became His children, having had assigned us the best and most secure rank by His orderly arrangement, which first circles about the world, the heavens, and the sun's circuits, and occupies itself with the motions of the rest of the stars for man's kehoof, and then busies itself with man himself, on whom all its care is concentrated; and regarding him as its greatest work, regulated his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by wisdom and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and tempered the body with beauty and proportion. And whatever in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions is right and regular, is the result of the inspiration of its rectitude and order.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Philanthropy of the Instructor</h2>

<p>The Lord ministers all good and all help, both as man and as God: as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forgiving our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and as man, training us not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Man is therefore <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he is His workmanship. The other works of creation He made by the word of command alone, but man He framed by Himself, by His own hand, and breathed into him what was peculiar to Himself. What, then, was fashioned by Him, and after He likeness, either was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself as being desirable on its own account, or was formed as being desirable on account of something else. If, then, man is an object desirable for itself, then He who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> loved what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the love-charm is within even in man, and is that very thing which is called the inspiration [or breath] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but if man was a desirable object on account of something else, God had no other reason for creating him, than that unless he came into being, it was not possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be a good Creator, or for man to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God would not have accomplished that on account of which man was created otherwise than by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and what hidden power in willing God possessed, He carried fully out by the forth-putting of His might externally in the act of creating, receiving from man what He made man;  and whom He had He saw, and what He wished that came to pass; and there is nothing which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do. Man, then, whom God made, is desirable for himself, and that which is desirable on his account is allied to him to whom it is desirable on his account; and this, too, is acceptable and liked.</p>

<p>But what is loveable, and is not also loved by Him? And man has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be loveable; consequently man is loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For how shall he not be loved for whose sake the only-begotten Son is sent from the Father's bosom, the Word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is superabundant; the Lord Himself distinctly confessing and saying, <q>For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021044"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;16:27</a></span> and again, <q>And hast loved them as You have loved Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021045"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;17:23</a></span> What, then, the Master desires and declares, and how He is disposed in deed and word, how He commands what is to be done, and forbids the opposite, has already been shown.</p>

<p>Plainly, then, the other kind of discourse, the didactic, is powerful and spiritual, observing precision, occupied in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. But let it stand over for the present. Now, it is incumbent on us to return His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, who lovingly guides us to that life which is best; and to live in accordance with the injunctions of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not only fulfilling what is commanded, or guarding against what is forbidden, but turning away from some examples, and imitating others as much as we can, and thus to perform the works of the Master according to His similitude, and so fulfil what <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says as to our being made in His image and likeness. For, wandering in life as in deep darkness, we need a guide that cannot stumble or stray; and our guide is the best, not blind, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>leading the blind into pits.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021046"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;15:14</a></span> But the Word is keen-sighted, and scans the recesses of the heart. As, then, that is not light which enlightens not, nor motion that moves not, nor loving which loves not, so neither is that good which profits not, nor guides to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Let us then aim at the fulfilment of the commandments by the works of the Lord; for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself also, having openly become flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note021047"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> exhibited the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, both practical and contemplative. Wherefore let us regard the Word as law, and His commands and counsels as the short and straight paths to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; for His precepts are full of persuasion, not of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Men and Women Alike Under the Instructor's Charge</h2>

<p>Let us, then, embracing more and more this good <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, give ourselves to the Lord; clinging to what is surest, the cable of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, and understanding that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the same. For if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of both is one, the master of both is also one; one church, one <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, one modesty; their food is common, marriage an equal yoke; respiration, sight, hearing, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all alike. And those whose life is common, have common graces and a common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; common to them are <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and training. <q>For in this world,</q> he says, <q>they marry, and are given in marriage,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021048"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;20:34</a></span> in which alone the female is distinguished from the male; <q>but in that world it is so no more.</q> There the rewards of this social and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, which is based on conjugal union, are laid up, not for male and female, but for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the sexual desire which divides humanity being removed. Common therefore, too, to men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, is the name of man. For this reason I think the Attics called, not boys only, but girls, <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, using it as a word of common gender; if Menander the comic poet, in <em>Rhapizomena</em>, appears to any one a sufficient authority, who thus speaks:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p>My little daughter; for by nature <br>The child (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) is most loving.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="greek">&#x1F0C;&#x03C1;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>, too, the word for lambs, is a common name of simplicity for the male and female animal.</p>

<p>Now the Lord Himself will feed us as His flock forever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. But without a sheperd, neither can sheep nor any other animal live, nor children without a tutor, nor domestics without a master.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. All Who Walk According to Truth are Children of God</h2>

<p>That, then, P&aelig;dagogy is the training of children (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03B4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&#x03B3;&#x1F75;</span>), is clear from the word itself. It remains for us to consider the children whom Scripture points to; then to give the p&aelig;dagogue charge of them. We are the children. In many ways Scripture celebrates us, and describes us in manifold figures of speech, giving variety to the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by diverse names. Accordingly, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>the Lord, standing on the shore, says to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a></q>&mdash; they happened to be fishing&mdash; <q>and called aloud, Children, have you any meat?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021049"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;21:4-5</a></span> &mdash; addressing those that were already in the position of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as children. <q>And they brought to Him,</q> it is said, <q>children, that He might put His hands on them and bless them; and when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> hindered them, Jesus said, Suffer the children, and forbid them not to come to Me, for of such is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021050"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;19:14</a></span> What the expression means the Lord Himself shall declare, saying, <q>Unless you be converted, and become as little chidren, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021051"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;18:3</a></span> not in that place speaking figuratively of regeneration, but setting before us, for our imitation, the simplicity that is in children. </p>

<p>The prophetic spirit also distinguishes us as children. <q>Plucking,</q> it is said, <q>branches of olives or palms, the children went forth to meet the Lord, and cried, saying, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David! Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021053"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;21:9</a></span> light, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and praise, with supplication to the Lord: for this is the meaning of the expression <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> when rendered in Greek. And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> appears to me, in allusion to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> just mentioned, reproachfully to upbraid the thoughtless: <q>Have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have perfected praise?</q>  In this way the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> spurs on His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, urging them to attend to Him, hastening as He was to the Father; rendering His hearers more eager by the intimation that after a little He was to depart, and showing them that it was requisite that they should take more unsparing advantage of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than ever before, as the Word was to ascend to heaven. Again, therefore, He calls them children; for He says, <q>Children, a little while I am with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021055"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;13:33</a></span> And, again, He likens the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to children sitting in the market-places and saying, <q>We have piped unto you, and you have not danced; we have mourned, and you have not lamented;</q>  and whatever else He added agreeably thereto. And it is not alone the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that holds these sentiments. Prophecy also agrees with it. David accordingly says, <q> <em>Praise, O children, the</em> Lord; <em>praise the name of the</em> Lord .</q>  It says also by Esaias, <q> <em>Here am I, and the children that God has given me.</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note021058"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;8:18</a></span> Are you amazed, then, to hear that men who belong to the nations are sons in the Lord's sight? You do not in that case appear to give ear to the Attic dialect, from which you may learn that beautiful, comely, and freeborn young maidens are still called <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, and servant-girls <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>; and that those last also are, on account of the bloom of youth, called by the flattering name of young maidens.</p>

<p>And when He says, <q>Let my lambs stand on my right,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021059"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> He alludes to the simple children, as if they were sheep and lambs in nature, not men; and the lambs He counts worthy of preference, from the superior regard He has to that tenderness and simplicity of disposition in men which constitutes innocence. Again, when He says, <q>as suckling calves,</q> He again alludes figuratively to us; and <q>as an innocent and gentle dove,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021060"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> the reference is again to us. Again, by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, He commands <q>two young pigeons or a pair of turtles to be offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q>  thus saying, that the harmlessness and innocence and placable nature of these tender young birds are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and explaining that like is an expiation for like. Further, the timorousness of the turtle-doves typifies <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>And that He calls us chickens the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> testifies: <q>As a hen gathers her chickens under her wings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021062"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37</a></span> Thus are we the Lord's chickens; the Word thus marvellously and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> describing the simplicity of childhood. For sometimes He calls us children, sometimes chickens, sometimes infants, and at other times sons, and <q>a new people,</q> and <q>a recent people.</q> <q>And my servants shall be called by a new name</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021063"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;65:15-16</a></span> (a new name, He says, fresh and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, pure and simple, and childlike and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>), which shall be blessed on the earth. And again, He figuratively calls us colts unyoked to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, not broken in by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but simple, and bounding joyously to the Father alone; not such horses <q>as neigh after their neighbours' wives, that are under the yoke, and are female-mad;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021064"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> but free and new-born, jubilant by means of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ready to run to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, swift to speed to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that tread and stamp under foot the things of the world.</p>

<p><q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; tell aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes, just, meek, and bringing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; meek <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is He, and riding on a beast of burden, and a young colt.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021065"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;9:9</a>; <a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;49:11</a></span> It was not enough to have said colt alone, but He added to it also <em>young</em>, to show the youth of humanity in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of simplicity, which shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no old age. And we who are little ones being such colts, are reared up by our divine colt-tamer. But if the new man in Scripture is represented by the ass, this ass is also a colt. <q>And he bound,</q> it is said, <q>the colt to the vine,</q> having bound this simple and childlike people to the word, whom He figuratively represents as a vine. For the vine produces wine, as the Word produces blood, and both drink for health to men&mdash; wine for the body, blood for the spirit.</p>

<p>And that He also calls us lambs, the Spirit by the mouth of Isaiah is an unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: <q>He will feed His flock like a shepherd, He will gather the lambs with His arm,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021066"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;40:11</a></span> &mdash; using the figurative appellation of lambs, which are still more tender than sheep, to express simplicity. And we also in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, honouring the fairest and most perfect objects in life with an appellation derived from the word child, have named training <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and discipline <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> . Discipline (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) we declare to be right guiding from childhood to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, our Lord revealed more distinctly to us what is signified by the appellation of children. On the question arising among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <q>which of them should be the greater,</q> Jesus placed a little child in the midst, saying, <q>Whosoever, shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself as this little child, the same shall be the greater in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021067"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;18:4</a></span> He does not then use the appellation of children on account of their very limited amount of understanding from their age, as some have thought. Nor, if He says, <q>Unless you become as these children, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> are His words to be understood as meaning <q>without learning.</q> We, then, who are infants, no longer roll on the ground, nor creep on the earth like serpents as before, crawling with the whole body about senseless <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; but, stretching upwards in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, loosed from the world and our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, touching the earth on tiptoe so as to appear to be in the world, we pursue <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> wisdom, although this seems folly to those whose wits are whetted for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Rightly, then, are those called children who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him who is God alone as their Father, who are simple, and infants, and guileless, who are lovers of the horns of the unicorns. </p>

<p>To those, therefore, that have made progress in the word, He has proclaimed this utterance, bidding them dismiss anxious care of the things of this world, and exhorting them to adhere to the Father alone, in imitation of children. Wherefore also in what follows He says: <q>Take no anxious thought for the morrow; sufficient unto the day is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021069"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;6:34</a></span> Thus He enjoins them to lay aside the cares of this life, and depend on the Father alone. And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the world&mdash;to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For so is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has honoured <em>perfection</em>, by applying to it the appellation <em>man</em>. For instance, by David, He says of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: <q>The Lord abhors the man of blood;</q>  he calls him man, as perfect in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: <q>For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021071"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> whether as children or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: <q>Till we all attain to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, may grow up to Him in all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021072"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13-15</a></span> &mdash; saying these things in order to the edification of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), that <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C0;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>: and <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> is <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> (since he that is tender-hearted is called <span class="greek">&#x1F24;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in conduct. This the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> most clearly pointed out when he said, <q>When we might have been burdensome as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we were gentle (<span class="greek">&#x1F24;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>) among you, as a nurse cherishes her children.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021073"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> The child (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) is therefore gentle (<span class="greek">&#x1F24;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is the basis of simplicity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For He says, <q>Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021074"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is wont to be called <q>a tender bride,</q> and a child <q>tender-hearted.</q> And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, is delicate as a child. On account of the hearts of the innocent, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, owns that he rejoices, and furnishes a kind of definition of children, so to speak, when he says, <q>I would have you wise toward good, but simple towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021075"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;16:19</a></span> For the name of child, <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, is not understood by us privatively, though the sons of the grammarians make the <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span> a privative particle. For if they call us who follow after childhood foolish, see how they utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Lord, in regarding those as foolish who have betaken themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if, which is rather the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the name. For the new minds, which have newly become wise, which have sprung into being according to the new covenant, are infantile in the old folly. Of late, then, God was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the coming of Christ: <q>For no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021076"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> </p>

<p>In contradistinction, therefore, to the older people, the new people are called young, having learned the new blessings; and we have the exuberance of life's morning prime in this youth which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no old age, in which we are always growing to maturity in intelligence, are always young, always mild, always new: for those must necessarily be new, who have become partakers of the new Word. And that which participates in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is wont to be assimilated to the incorruptible: so that to us appertains the designation of the age of childhood, a lifelong spring-time, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is in us, and our habits saturated with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, cannot be touched by old age; but Wisdom is ever blooming, ever remains consistent and the same, and never changes. <q>Their children,</q> it is said, <q>shall be borne upon their shoulders, and fondled on their knees; as one whom his mother comforts, so also shall I comfort you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021077"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;66:12-13</a></span> The mother draws the children to herself; and we seek our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Whatever is feeble and tender, as needing help on account of its feebleness, is kindly looked on, and is sweet and pleasant, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> changing into help in the case of such: for thus horses' colts, and the little calves of cows, and the lion's cub, and the stag's fawn, and the child of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, are looked upon with pleasure by their fathers and mothers. Thus also the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> cherishes affection towards those who have fled to Him; and having begotten them again by His Spirit to the adoption of children, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them as gentle, and loves those alone, and aids and fights for them; and therefore He bestows on them the name of child. The word Isaac I also connect with child. Isaac means laughter. He was seen sporting with his wife and helpmeet Rebecca by the prying king. <span class="stiki" id="note021078"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;26:8</a></span> The king, whose name was Abimelech, appears to me to represent a supramundane wisdom contemplating the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of sport. They interpret Rebecca to mean endurance. O wise sport, laughter also assisted by endurance, and the king as spectator! The spirit of those that are children in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose lives are ordered in endurance, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. And this is the divine sport. <q>Such a sport, of his own, Jove sports,</q> says Heraclitus. For what other employment is seemly for a wise and perfect man, than to sport and be glad in the endurance of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash; and, in the administration of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, holding festival with God? That which is signified by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> may be interpreted differently&mdash;namely, of our rejoicing for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as Isaac. He also, delivered from death, laughed, sporting and rejoicing with his spouse, who was the type of the Helper of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom the stable name of endurance is given; for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> surely, because she alone remains to all generations, rejoicing ever, subsisting as she does by the endurance of us <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who are the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of those that have endured to the end, and the rejoicing on their account, is the mystic sport, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> accompanied with decorous solace which brings us aid.</p> 

<p>The King, then, who is Christ, beholds from above our laughter, and looking through the window, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, views the thanksgiving, and the blessing, and the rejoicing, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and furthermore the endurance which works together with them and their embrace: views His Church, showing only His face, which was wanting to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is made perfect by her royal Head. And where, then, was the door by which the Lord showed Himself? The flesh by which He was manifested. He is Isaac (for the narrative may be interpreted otherwise), who is a type of the Lord, a child as a son; for he was the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> as the Lord, but he was not immolated as the Lord. Isaac only bore the wood of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as the Lord the wood of the cross. And he laughed <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, prophesying that the Lord should fill us with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, who have been redeemed from corruption by the blood of the Lord. Isaac did everything but suffer, as was right, yielding the precedence in suffering to the Word. Furthermore, there is an intimation of the divinity of the Lord in His not being slain. For Jesus rose again after His burial, having suffered no harm, like Isaac released from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. And in defence of the point to be established, I shall adduce another consideration of the greatest weight. The Spirit calls the Lord Himself a child, thus prophesying by Esaias: <q>Lo, to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given, on whose own shoulder the government shall be; and His name has been called the Angel of great Counsel.</q> Who, then, is this infant child? He according to whose image we are made little children. By the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is declared His greatness: <q>Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace; that He might fulfil His discipline: and of His peace there shall be no end.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021079"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> O the great God! O the perfect child! The Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in the Son. And how shall not the discipline of this child be perfect, which extends to all, leading as a schoolmaster us as children who are His little ones? He has stretched forth to us those hands of His that are conspicuously worthy of trust. To this child additional testimony is borne by John, <q>the greatest <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> among those born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021080"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;7:28</a></span> Behold the Lamb of God!  For since Scripture calls the infant children lambs, it has also called Him&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>&mdash; who became man for our sakes, and who wished in all points to be made like to us&mdash; <q>the Lamb of God</q>&mdash; Him, namely, that is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the child of the Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Name Children Does Not Imply Instruction in Elementary Principles</h2>

<p>We have ample means of encountering those who are given to carping. For we are not termed children and infants with reference to the childish and contemptible character of our education, as those who are inflated on account of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> have <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniously</a> alleged. Straightway, on our regeneration, we attained that perfection after which we aspired. For we were illuminated, which is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. He is not then imperfect who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is perfect. And do not reprehend me when I profess to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for so it was deemed right to speak to the Word, and He is free.  For at the moment of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> there sounded a voice from heaven, as a testimony to the Beloved, <q>You are My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, today have I begotten You.</q> Let us then ask the wise, Is Christ, begotten today, already perfect, or&mdash; what were most monstrous&mdash; imperfect? If the latter, there is some addition He requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is absurd, since He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For none can be superior to the Word, or the teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant, that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in perfection, according to &oelig;conomic fore-ordination? And if He was perfect, why was He, the perfect one, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? It was necessary, they say, to fulfil the profession that pertained to humanity. Most excellent. Well, I assert, simultaneously with His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by John, He becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; alone, and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is the case. The same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ became. Being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become sons; being made sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. <q>I,</q> says He, <q>have said that you are gods, and all sons of the Highest.</q>  This work is variously called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  and illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions are remitted; and illumination, by which that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that perfect which wants nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God? For it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> monstrous that that which is not complete should be called a gift (or act) of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Being perfect, He consequently bestows perfect gifts. As at His command all things were made, so on His bare wishing to bestow <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, ensues the perfecting of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the future of time is anticipated by the power of His volition.</p>

<p>Further release from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. We then alone, who first have touched the confines of life, are already perfect; and we already live who are separated from death. Salvation, accordingly, is the following of Christ: For that which is in Him is life. <span class="stiki" id="note021085"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;1:4</a></span> <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears My words, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him that sent Me, has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and comes not into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021086"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;5:24</a></span> Thus believing alone, and regeneration, is perfection in life; for God is never weak. For as His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is work, and this  is named the world; so also His counsel is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and this has been called the church. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, therefore, whom He has called, and whom He has saved; and at one and the same time He called and saved them. <q>For you are,</q> says the apostle, <q>taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021088"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> It is not then allowable to think of what is taught by Him as imperfect; and what is learned from Him is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Saviour, to whom be thanks for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And he who is only regenerated&mdash; as the name necessarily indicates&mdash; and is enlightened, is delivered immediately from darkness, and on the instant receives the light.</p>

<p>As, then, those who have shaken off sleep immediately become all awake within; or rather, as those who try to remove a film that is over the eyes, do not supply to them from without the light which they do not possess, but removing the obstacle from the eyes, leave the pupil free; thus also we who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, having wiped off the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which obscure the light of the Divine Spirit, have the eye of the spirit free, unimpeded, and full of light, by which alone we contemplate the Divine, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> flowing down to us from above. This is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, since like loves like; and that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, loves that from which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. <q>Once you were darkness, now are you light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021089"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancients <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x1F7D;&#x03C2;</span> .  But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehends him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time&mdash; both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when He said: <q>For this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father, that every one that sees the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021091"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;6:40</a></span> As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son has everlasting life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021092"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span> If, then, those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> have life, what remains beyond the possession of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? Nothing is wanting to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If anything is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, <q>Be it according to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021093"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;9:29</a></span> And where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the end of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is rest&mdash; the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, through which we fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, purblind as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting  of what is better. For what <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has bound ill, is by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, our transgressions being taken away by one P&oelig;onian  medicine, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Word. We are washed from all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and are no longer entangled in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This is the one <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is trained by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the one universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: <q>Before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we might be justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but after that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</q>  Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: <q>For you are all the children of God through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. For as many as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021097"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;3:26-28</a></span> There are not, then, in the same Word some <q>illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men;</q> but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: <q>For by one spirit are we all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one body, whether <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021098"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:13</a></span> Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, renouncing our iniquities, purified by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, speed back to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: <q>I thank You, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them to babes;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021099"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as if lisping with the children, <q>Even so, Father; for so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Your sight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021100"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and put on the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of Christ; that we may become a new, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,  is cleansed from fornication and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. With the greatest clearness the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: <q>Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be children, but in understanding be men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021102"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:20</a></span> And the expression, <q>When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,</q>  points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and speaking childish things he <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the word <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> has two meanings.  <q>When I became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I put away childish things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021105"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:11</a></span> It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name <q>children</q> to those who are under the law, who are terrified by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as children are by bugbears; and <q>men</q> to us who are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and are saved by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: <q> <em>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note021106"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;4:1-5</a></span> by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but has conferred manhood on those who are under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: <q>For you are no more a servant,</q> he says, <q>but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021107"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, <q>When I was a child,</q> may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom alone the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls man, as we have said before. <q>I put away childish things.</q> But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: <q>I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for you were not able, neither yet are you now able.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021108"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, <q>I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021109"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;3:8</a></span> A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: <q> <em>I have fed you with milk in Christ;</em></q> and after a slight stop, let us add, <q>as children,</q> that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and natural nourishment&mdash;namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the milk which is perfect is perfect nourishment, and brings to that consummation which cannot cease. Wherefore also the same milk and honey were promised in the rest. Rightly, therefore, the Lord again promises milk to the righteous, that the Word may be clearly shown to be both, <q>the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021110"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse8">Revelation&nbsp;1:8</a></span> the Word being figuratively represented as milk. Something like this Homer oracularly declares against his will, when he calls righteous men milk-fed (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F71;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>).  So also may we take the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021112"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> so that the carnal may be understood as those recently instructed, and still babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For he called those who had already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> spiritual, and those newly instructed and not yet purified carnal; whom with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> he calls still carnal, as minding equally with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> the things of the flesh: <q>For whereas there is among you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and strife, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021113"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> <q>Wherefore also I have given you milk to drink,</q> he says; meaning, I have instilled into you the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which, from instruction, nourishes up to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But the expression, <q>I have given you to drink</q> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;</span>), is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of perfect appropriation. For those who are full-grown are said to drink, babes to suck. <q>For my blood,</q> says the Lord, <q>is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> drink.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021114"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse55">John&nbsp;6:55</a></span> In saying, therefore, <q>I have given you milk to drink,</q> has he not indicated the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in the Word, who is the milk? And what follows next, <q>not meat, for you were not able,</q> may indicate the clear revelation in the future world, like food, face to face. <q>For now we see as through a glass,</q> the same apostle says, <q>but then face to face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021115"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> Wherefore also he has added, <q>neither yet are you now able, for you are still carnal,</q> minding the things of the flesh&mdash;desiring, loving, feeling jealousy, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. <q>For we are no more in the flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021116"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> as some suppose. For with it [they say], having the face which is like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a>, we shall see the promise face to face. How then, if that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the promise after our departure hence, say they that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <q>what eye has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, nor has entered into the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> who have not perceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but received from instruction <q>what ear has not heard,</q>  or that ear alone which <q>was rapt up into the third heaven?</q>  But it even then was commanded to preserve it unspoken.</p>

<p>But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, as it remains to understand, is the glorying in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, hear the law of Scripture: <q>Let not the wise man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom, and let not the mighty man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his might; but let him that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q>  But we are God-taught, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How then are we not to regard the apostle as attaching this sense to the milk of the babes? And if we who preside over the Churches are shepherds after the image of the good Shepherd, and you the sheep, are we not to regard the Lord as preserving consistency in the use of figurative speech, when He speaks also of the milk of the flock? And to this meaning we may secondly accommodate the expression, <q>I have given you milk to drink, and not given you food, for you are not yet able,</q> regarding the meat not as something different from the milk, but the same in substance. For the very same Word is fluid and mild as milk, or solid and compact as meat. And entertaining this view, we may regard the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which is universally diffused, as milk; and as meat, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which from instruction is compacted into a foundation, which, being more substantial than hearing, is likened to meat, and assimilates to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself nourishment of this kind. Elsewhere the Lord, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, brought this out by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, when He said: <q>Eat my flesh, and drink my blood;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021120"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;6:34</a></span> describing distinctly by metaphor the drinkable properties of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the promise, by means of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being consisting of many members, is refreshed and grows, is welded together and compacted of both&mdash;of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the body, and of hope, which is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; as also the Lord of flesh and blood. For in reality the blood of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is hope, in which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is held as by a vital principle. And when hope expires, it is as if blood flowed forth; and the vitality of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is destroyed. If, then, some would oppose, saying that by milk is meant the first lessons&mdash; as it were, the first food&mdash; and that by meat is meant those spiritual cognitions to which they attain by raising themselves to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, let them understand that, in saying that meat is solid food, and the flesh and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, they are brought by their own vainglorious wisdom to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> simplicity. For the blood is found to be an original product in man, and some have consequently ventured to call it the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And this blood, transmuted by a natural process of assimilation in the pregnancy of the mother, through the sympathy of parental affection, effloresces and grows old, in order that there may be no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for the child. Blood, too, is the moister part of flesh, being a kind of liquid flesh; and milk is the sweeter and finer part of blood. For whether it be the blood supplied to the f&oelig;tus, and sent through the navel of the mother, or whether it be the menses themselves shut out from their proper passage, and by a natural diffusion, bidden by the all-nourishing and creating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, proceed to the already swelling breasts, and by the heat of the spirits transmuted, [whether it be the one or the other] that is formed into food desirable for the babe, that which is changed is the blood. For of all the members, the breasts have the most sympathy with the womb. When there is parturition, the vessel by which blood was conveyed to the f&oelig;tus is cut off: there is an obstruction of the flow, and the blood receives an impulse towards the breasts; and on a considerable rush taking place, they are distended, and change the blood to milk in a manner analogous to the change of blood into pus in ulceration. Or if, on the other hand, the blood from the veins in the vicinity of the breasts, which have been opened in pregnancy, is poured into the natural hollows of the breasts; and the spirit discharged from the neighbouring arteries being mixed with it, the substance of the blood, still remaining pure, it becomes white by being agitated like a wave; and by an interruption such as this is changed by frothing it, like what takes place with the sea, which at the assaults of the winds, the poets say, <q>spits forth briny foam.</q> Yet still the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is supplied by the blood.</p>

<p>In this way also the rivers, borne on with rushing motion, and fretted by contact with the surrounding air, murmur forth foam. The moisture in our mouth, too, is whitened by the breath. What an absurdity  is it, then, not to acknowledge that the blood is converted into that very bright and white substance by the breath! The change it suffers is in quality, not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. You will certainly find nothing else more nourishing, or sweeter, or whiter than milk. In every respect, accordingly, it is like spiritual nourishment, which is sweet through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, nourishing as life, bright as the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>The blood of the Word has been also exhibited as milk. Milk being thus provided in parturition, is supplied to the infant; and the breasts, which till then looked straight towards the husband, now bend down towards the child, being taught to furnish the substance elaborated by nature in a way easily received for salutary nourishment. For the breasts are not like fountains full of milk, flowing in ready prepared; but, by effecting a change in the nutriment, form the milk in themselves, and discharge it. And the nutriment suitable and wholesome for the new-formed and new-born babe is elaborated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the nourisher and the Father of all that are generated and regenerated&mdash;as manna, the celestial food of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, flowed down from heaven on the ancient Hebrews. Even now, in fact, nurses call the first-poured drink of milk by the same name as that food&mdash; manna. Further, pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, on becoming mothers, discharge milk. But the Lord Christ, the fruit of the Virgin, did not pronounce the breasts of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> blessed, nor selected them to give nourishment; but when the kind and loving Father had rained down the Word, Himself became spiritual nourishment to the good. O mystic marvel! The universal Father is one, and one the universal Word; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one and the same everywhere, and one is the only virgin mother. I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to call her the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This mother, when alone, had not milk, because alone she was not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But she is once virgin and mother&mdash; pure as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, loving as a mother. And calling her children to her, she nurses them with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> milk, viz., with the Word for childhood. Therefore she had not milk; for the milk was this child fair and comely, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which nourishes by the Word the young brood, which the Lord Himself brought forth in throes of the flesh, which the Lord Himself swathed in His precious blood. O amazing birth! O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> swaddling bands! The Word is all to the child, both father and mother and tutor and nurse. <q>Eat my flesh,</q> He says, <q>and drink my blood.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021122"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse53">John&nbsp;6:53-54</a></span> Such is the suitable food which the Lord ministers, and He offers His flesh and pours forth His blood, and nothing is wanting for the children's growth. O amazing <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! We are enjoined to cast off the old and carnal corruption, as also the old nutriment, receiving in exchange another new regimen, that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, receiving Him if we can, to hide Him within; and that, enshrining the Saviour in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we may correct the affections of our flesh.</p>

<p>But you are not inclined to understand it thus, but perchance more generally. Hear it also in the following way. The flesh figuratively represents to us the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for the flesh was created by Him. The blood points out to us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been infused into life; and the union of both is the Lord, the food of the babes&mdash; the Lord who is Spirit and Word. The food&mdash; that is, the Lord Jesus&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the Spirit made flesh, the heavenly flesh sanctified. The nutriment is the milk of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by which alone we infants are nourished. The Word Himself, then, the beloved One, and our nourisher, has shed His own blood for us, to save humanity; and by Him, we, believing on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, flee to the Word, <q>the care-soothing breast</q> of the Father. And He alone, as is befitting, supplies us children with the milk of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and those only are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed who suck this breast. Wherefore also Peter says: <q>Laying therefore aside all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking, as new-born babes, desire the milk of the word, that you may grow by it to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; if you have tasted that the Lord is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  And were one to concede to them that the meat was something different from the milk, then how shall they avoid being transfixed on their own spit, through want of consideration of nature?  For in winter, when the air is condensed, and prevents the escape of the heat enclosed within, the food, transmuted and digested and changed into blood, passes into the veins, and these, in the absence of exhalation, are greatly distended, and exhibit strong pulsations; consequently also nurses are then fullest of milk. And we have shown a little above, that on pregnancy blood passes into milk by a change which does not affect its substance, just as in old people yellow hair changes to grey. But again in summer, the body, having its pores more open, affords greater facility for diaphoretic action in the case of the food, and the milk is least abundant, since neither is the blood full, nor is the whole nutriment retained. If, then, the digestion of the food results in the production of blood, and the blood becomes milk, then blood is a preparation for milk, as blood is for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and the grape for the vine. With milk, then, the Lord's nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born; and as soon as we are regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good news of the hope of rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is written that milk and honey fall in showers, receiving through what is material the pledge of the sacred food. <q>For meats are done away with,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021125"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span> as the apostle himself says; but this nourishment on milk leads to the heavens, rearing up citizens of heaven, and members of the angelic choirs. And since the Word is the gushing fountain of life, and has been called a river of olive oil, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, using appropriate figurative language, and calling Him milk, adds: <q>I have given you to drink;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021126"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> for we drink in the word, the nutriment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, also liquid food is called drink; and the same thing may somehow be both meat and drink, according to the different aspects in which it is considered, just as cheese is the solidification of milk or milk solidified; for I am not concerned here to make a nice selection of an expression, only to say that one substance supplies both articles of food. Besides, for children at the breast, milk alone suffices; it serves both for meat and drink. <q>I,</q> says the Lord, <q>have meat to eat that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of. My meat is to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021127"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;4:32-34</a></span> You see another kind of food which, similarly with milk, represents figuratively the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Besides, also, the completion of His own passion He called catachrestically <q>a cup,</q>  when He alone had to drink and drain it. Thus to Christ the fulfilling of His Father's will was food; and to us infants, who drink the milk of the word of the heavens, Christ Himself is food. Hence seeking is called sucking; for to those babes that seek the Word, the Father's breasts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> supply milk.</p>

<p>Further, the Word declares Himself to be the bread of heaven. <q>For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> He says, <q>gave you not that bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He that comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world. And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</q>  Here is to be noted the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the bread, inasmuch as He speaks of it as flesh, and as flesh, consequently, that has risen through fire, as the wheat springs up from decay and germination; and, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it has risen through fire for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as bread baked. But this will be shown by and by more clearly in the chapter on the resurrection. But since He said, <q>And the bread which I will give is My flesh,</q> and since flesh is moistened with blood, and blood is figuratively termed wine, we are bidden to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as bread, crumbled into a mixture of wine and water, seizes on the wine and leaves the watery portion, so also the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the bread of heaven absorbs the blood; that is, those among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are heavenly, nourishing them up to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and leaving only to destruction the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh.</p>

<p>Thus in many ways the Word is figuratively described, as meat, and flesh, and food, and bread, and blood, and milk. The Lord is all these, to give enjoyment to us who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him. Let no one then think it strange, when we say that the Lord's blood is figuratively represented as milk. For is it not figuratively represented as wine? <q>Who washes,</q> it is said, <q>His garment in wine, His robe in the blood of the grape.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021130"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;49:11</a></span> In His own Spirit He says He will deck the body of the Word; as certainly by His own Spirit He will nourish those who hunger for the Word.</p>

<p>And that the blood is the Word, is testified by the blood of Abel,  the righteous interceding with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the blood would never have uttered a voice, had it not been regarded as the Word: for the righteous man of old is the type of the new righteous one; and the blood of old that interceded, intercedes in the place of the new blood. And the blood that is the Word cries to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it intimated that the Word was to suffer.</p>

<p>Further, this flesh, and the blood in it, are by a mutual sympathy moistened and increased by the milk. And the process of formation of the seed in conception ensues when it has mingled with the pure residue of the menses, which remains. For the force that is in the seed coagulating the substances of the blood, as the rennet curdles milk, effects the essential part of the formative process. For a suitable blending conduces to fruitfulness; but extremes are adverse, and tend to sterility. For when the earth itself is flooded by excessive rain, the seed is swept away, while in consequence of scarcity it is dried up; but when the sap is viscous, it retains the seed, and makes it germinate. Some also hold the hypothesis, that the seed of an animal is in substance the foam of the blood, which being by the natural heat of the male agitated and shaken out is turned into foam, and deposited in the seminal veins. For Diogenes Apollionates will have it, that hence is derived the word <em>aphrodisia.</em> </p>

<p>From all this it is therefore evident, that the essential principle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is blood. The contents of the stomach, too, at first are milky, a coagulation of fluid; then the same coagulated substance is changed into blood; but when it is formed into a compact consistency in the womb, by the natural and warm spirit by which the embryo is fashioned, it becomes a living creature. Further also, the child after birth is nourished by the same blood. For the flow of milk is the product of the blood; and the source of nourishment is the milk; by which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is shown to have brought forth a child, and to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a mother, by which also she receives a potent charm of affection. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the apostle, using the voice of the Lord, says <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, <q>I have given you milk to drink.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021133"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> For if we have been regenerated unto Christ, He who has regenerated us nourishes us with His own milk, the Word; for it is proper that what has procreated should immediately supply nourishment to that which has been procreated. And as the regeneration was conformably spiritual, so also was the nutriment of man spiritual. In all respects, therefore, and in all things, we are brought into union with Christ, into relationship through His blood, by which we are redeemed; and into sympathy, in consequence of the nourishment which flows from the Word; and into <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, through His guidance:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Among men the bringing up of children <br>Often produces stronger impulses to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than the procreating of them.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The same blood and milk of the Lord is therefore the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Lord's passion and teaching. Wherefore each of us babes is permitted to make our boast in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, while we proclaim:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Yet of a noble sire and noble blood I boast me sprung.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And that milk is produced from blood by a change, is already clear; yet we may learn it from the flocks and herds. For these animals, in the time of the year which we call spring, when the air has more humidity, and the grass and meadows are juicy and moist, are first filled with blood, as is shown by the distension of the veins of the swollen vessels; and from the blood the milk flows more copiously. But in summer again, the blood being burnt and dried up by the heat, prevents the change, and so they have less milk.</p>

<p>Further, milk has a most natural affinity for water, as assuredly the spiritual washing has for the spiritual nutriment. Those, therefore, that swallow a little cold water, in addition to the above-mentioned milk, straightway feel benefit; for the milk is prevented from souring by its combination with water, not in consequence of any antipathy between them, but in consequence of the water taking kindly to the milk while it is undergoing digestion.</p>

<p>And such as is the union of the Word with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is the agreement of milk with water; for it receives it alone of all liquids, and admits of mixture with water, for the purpose of cleansing, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And it is mixed naturally with honey also, and this for cleansing along with sweet nutriment. For the Word blended with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> at once cures our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and cleanses our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and the saying,</p> <blockquote><p><q>Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>seems to me to have been spoken of the Word, who is honey. And <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> oft extols Him <q>above honey and the honeycomb.</q> </p>

<p>Furthermore, milk is mixed with sweet wine; and the mixture is beneficial, as when suffering is mixed in the cup in order to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For the milk is curdled by the wine, and separated, and whatever adulteration is in it is drained off. And in the same way, the spiritual communion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with suffering man, drawing off as serous matter the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, commits man to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, along with those who are divine, immortalizing him.</p>

<p>Further, many also use the fat of milk, called butter, for the lamp, plainly indicating by this enigma the abundant unction of the Word, since He alone it is who nourishes the infants, makes them grow, and enlightens them. Wherefore also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says respecting the Lord, <q>He fed them with the produce of the fields; they sucked honey from the rock, and oil from the solid rock, butter of cattle, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021137"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:13-14</a></span> and what follows He gave them. But he that prophesies the birth of the child says: <q>Butter and honey shall He eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021138"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;7:15</a></span> And it occurs to me to wonder how some dare call themselves perfect and gnostics, with ideas of themselves above the apostle, inflated and boastful, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> even owned respecting himself, <q>Not that I have already attained, or am already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forth to those that are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021139"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;3:12-14</a></span> And yet he reckons himself perfect, because he has been emancipated from his former life, and strives after the better life, not as perfect in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but as aspiring after perfection.

<h2>Chapter 7. Who the Instructor Is, and Respecting His Instruction</h2>

<p>Since, then, we have shown that all of us are by Scripture called children; and not only so, but that we who have followed Christ are figuratively called babes; and that the Father of all alone is perfect, for the Son is in Him, and the Father is in the Son; it is time for us in due course to say who our Instructor is.</p>

<p>He is called Jesus. Sometimes He calls Himself a shepherd, and says, <q>I am the good Shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021141"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> According to a metaphor drawn from shepherds, who lead the sheep, is hereby understood the Instructor, who leads the children&mdash; the Shepherd who tends the babes. For the babes are simple, being figuratively described as sheep. <q>And they shall all,</q> it is said, <q>be one flock, and one shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021142"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;10:16</a></span> The Word, then, who leads the children to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is appropriately called <em>the Instructor</em>  (P&aelig;dagogue).</p>

<p>With the greatest clearness, accordingly, the Word has spoken respecting Himself by Hosea: <q>I am your Instructor.</q>  Now <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is instruction, being the learning of the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and training in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and right guidance which leads to heaven. And the word <q>instruction</q>  is employed variously. For there is the instruction of him who is led and learns, and that of him who leads and teaches; and there is, thirdly, the guidance itself; and fourthly, what is taught, as the commandments enjoined.</p>

<p>Now the instruction which is of God is the right direction of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the exhibition of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in everlasting perseverance.</p>

<p>As therefore the general directs the phalanx, consulting the safety of his soldiers, and the pilot steers the vessel, desiring to save the passengers; so also the Instructor guides the children to a saving course of conduct, through solicitude for us; and, in general, whatever we ask in accordance with reason from God to be done for us, will happen to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Instructor. And just as the helmsman does not always yield to the winds, but sometimes, turning the prow towards them, opposes the whole force of the hurricanes; so the Instructor never yields to the blasts that blow in this world, nor commits the child to them like a vessel to make shipwreck on a wild and licentious course of life; but, wafted on by the favouring breeze of the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, stoutly holds on to the child's helm&mdash;his ears, I mean&mdash;until He bring him safe to anchor in the haven of heaven.</p>

<p>What is called by men an ancestral custom passes away in a moment, but the divine guidance is a possession which abides for ever.</p>

<p>They say that Ph&oelig;nix was the instructor of Achilles, and Adrastus of the children of Cr&oelig;sus; and Leonides of Alexander, and Nausithous of Philip. But Ph&oelig;nix was women-mad, Adrastus was a fugitive. Leonides did not curtail the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of Alexander, nor Nausithous reform the drunken Pell&aelig;an. No more was the Thracian Zopyrus able to check the fornication of Alcibiades; but Zopyrus was a bought slave, and Sicinnus, the tutor of the children of Themistocles, was a lazy domestic. They say also that he invented the Sicinnian dance. Those have not escaped our attention who are called royal instructors among the Persians; whom, in number four, the kings of the Persians select with the greatest care from all the Persians and set over their sons. But the children only learn the use of the bow, and on reaching maturity have sexual intercourse with sisters, and mothers, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, wives and courtesans innumerable, practiced in intercourse like the wild boars.</p>

<p>But our Instructor is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God Jesus, the Word, who is the guide of all humanity. The loving God Himself is our Instructor. Somewhere in song the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says with regard to Him, <q>He provided sufficiently for the people in the wilderness. He led him about in the thirst of summer heat in a dry land, and instructed him, and kept him as the apple of His eye, as an eagle protects her nest, and shows her fond solicitude for her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, and bears them on her back. The Lord alone led them, and there was no strange god with them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021146"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:10-12</a></span> Clearly, I trow, has the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> exhibited the Instructor in the account it gives of His guidance.</p>

<p>Again, when He speaks in His own person, He confesses Himself to be the Instructor: <q>I am the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021147"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;20:2</a></span> Who, then, has the power of leading in and out? Is it not the Instructor? This was He who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said to him, <q>I am your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be accepted before Me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021148"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;17:1-2</a></span> and in a way most befitting an instructor, forms him into a faithful child, saying, <q>And be blameless; and I will make My covenant between Me and you, and your seed.</q> There is the communication of the Instructor's friendship. And He most manifestly appears as Jacob's instructor. He says accordingly to him, <q>Lo, I am with you, to keep you in all the way in which you shall go; and I will bring you back into this land: for I will not leave you till I do what I have told you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021149"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;28:15</a></span> He is said, too, to have wrestled with Him. <q>And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled with him a man (the Instructor) till the morning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021150"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;32:24</a></span> This was the man who led, and brought, and wrestled with, and anointed the athlete Jacob against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.  Now that the Word was at once Jacob's trainer and the Instructor of humanity [appears from this]&mdash; <q>He asked,</q> it is said, <q>His name, and said to him, Tell me what is Your name.</q> And he said, <q>Why is it that you ask My name?</q> For He reserved the new name for the new people&mdash; the babe; and was as yet unnamed, the Lord God not having yet become man. Yet Jacob called the name of the place, <q>Face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>For I have seen,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face; and my life is preserved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021152"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;32:30</a></span> The face of God is the Word by whom God is manifested and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Then also was he named <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because he saw God the Lord. It was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word, the Instructor, who said to him again afterwards, <q>Fear not to go down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021153"><a href="../bible/gen046.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;46:3</a></span> See how the Instructor follows the righteous man, and how He anoints the athlete, teaching him to trip up his antagonist.</p>

<p>It is He also who teaches <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to act as instructor. For the Lord says, <q>If any one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before Me, him will I blot out of My book; but now, go and lead this people into the place which I told you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021154"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse33">Exodus&nbsp;32:33-34</a></span> Here He is the teacher of the art of instruction. For it was really the Lord that was the instructor of the ancient people by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; but He is the instructor of the new people by Himself, face to face. <q>For behold,</q> He says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> shall go before you,</q> representing the evangelical and commanding power of the Word, but guarding the Lord's prerogative. <q>In the day on which I will visit them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021155"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse33">Exodus&nbsp;32:33-34</a></span> He says, <q>I will bring their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on them; that is, on the day on which I will sit as judge I will render the recompense of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> For the same who is Instructor is judge, and judges those who disobey Him; and the loving Word will not pass over their transgression in silence. He reproves, that they may repent. For <q>the Lord wills the repentance of the sinner rather than his death.</q>  And let us as babes, hearing of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, keep from similar transgressions, through dread of the threatening, that we may not have to undergo like sufferings. What, then, was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which they committed? <q>For in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> they slew men, and in their impetuosity they hamstrung bulls. Cursed be their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021157"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;49:6</a></span> Who, then, would train us more lovingly than He? Formerly the older people had an old covenant, and the law disciplined the people with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and the Word was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but to the fresh and new people has also been given a new covenant, and the Word has appeared, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is turned to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and that mystic <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is born&mdash; Jesus. For this same Instructor said then, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021158"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:2</a></span> but to us He has addressed the exhortation, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021159"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37</a></span> Wherefore also this is enjoined on us: <q>Cease from your own works, from your old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> <q>Learn to do well;</q> <q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good;</q> <q>You have loved righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity.</q> This is my new covenant written in the old letter. The newness of the word must not, then, be made ground of reproach. But the Lord has also said in Jeremiah: <q>Say not that I am a youth: before I formed you in the belly I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you, and before I brought you out of the womb I sanctified you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021160"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:7</a></span> Such allusions <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can make to us, destined in the eye of God to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before the foundation of the world; but now babes, through the recent fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to which we are born now to calling and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore also He adds, <q>I have set you for a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021161"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> saying that he must prophesy, so that the appellation of <q>youth</q> should not become a reproach to those who are called babes.</p>

<p>Now the law is ancient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by the Word. Wherefore also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>The law was given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021162"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> not by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but by the Word, and through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> His servant. Wherefore it was only temporary; but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Mark the expressions of Scripture: of the law only is it said <q>was given;</q> but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> work of the Word; and it is not said to <em>be given</em>, but <em>to be</em> by Jesus, <em>without whom nothing was</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note021163"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Presently, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, giving place to the perfect Instructor the Word, predicts both the name and the office of Instructor, and committing to the people the commands of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, sets before them the Instructor. <q>A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q> says he, <q>like Me shall God raise up to you of your brethren,</q> pointing out Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by an allusion to Jesus the son of Nun; for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> predicted in the law was a shadow of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He adds, therefore, consulting the advantage of the people, <q>Him shall you hear;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021164"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:15</a></span> and, <q>The man who will not hear that Prophet,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021165"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:19</a></span> him He threatens. Such a name, then, he predicts as that of the Instructor, who is the author of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> invests Him with a rod, a rod of discipline, of rule, of authority; that those whom the persuasive word heals not, the threatening may heal; and whom the threatening heals not, the rod may heal; and whom the rod heals not, the fire may devour. <q>There shall come forth,</q> it is said, <q>a rod out of the root of Jesse.</q> </p>

<p>See the care, and wisdom, and power of the Instructor: <q>He shall not judge according to opinion, nor according to report; but He shall dispense judgment to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and reprove the sinners of the earth.</q> And by David: <q>The Lord instructing, has instructed me, and not given me over to death.</q>  For to be chastised of the Lord, and instructed, is deliverance from death. And by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He says: <q>You shall rule them with a rod of iron.</q>  Thus also the apostle, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, being moved, says, <q>What will you? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in the spirit of meekness?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021169"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:21</a></span> Also, <q>The Lord shall send the rod of strength out of Sion,</q>  He says by another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And this same rod of instruction, <q>Your rod and staff have comforted me,</q>  said some one else. Such is the power of the Instructor&mdash; sacred, soothing, saving.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Against Those Who Think that What is Just is Not Good</h2>

<p>At this stage some rise up, saying that the Lord, by reason of the rod, and threatening, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, is not good; misapprehending, as appears, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which says, <q>And he that fears the Lord will turn to his heart;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021172"><a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse6">Sirach&nbsp;21:6</a></span> and most of all, oblivious of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in that for us He became man. For more suitably to Him, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in these words: <q>Remember us, for we are dust;</q>  that is, Sympathize with us; for You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from personal experience of suffering the weakness of the flesh. In this respect, therefore, the Lord the Instructor is most good and unimpeachable, sympathizing as He does from the exceeding greatness of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each man. <q>For there is nothing which the Lord <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021174"><a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;11:24</a></span> For assuredly He does not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> anything, and yet wish that which He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> to exist. Nor does He wish anything not to exist, and yet become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to that which He wishes not to exist. Nor does He wish anything not to exist which yet exists. If, then, the Word <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> anything, He does not wish it to exist. But nothing exists, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not supplied by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nothing, then, is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor yet by the Word. For both are one&mdash; that is, God. For He has said, <q>In the beginning the Word was in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021175"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> If then He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> none of the things which He has made, it follows that He loves them. Much more than the rest, and with reason, will He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> man, the noblest of all objects created by Him, and a God-loving being. Therefore God is loving; consequently the Word is loving.</p>

<p>But he who loves anything wishes to do it good. And that which does good must be every way better than that which does not good. But nothing is better than the Good. The Good, then, does good. And God is admitted to be good. God therefore does good. And the Good, in virtue of its being good, does nothing else than do good. Consequently God does all good. And He does no good to man without caring for him, and He does not care <em>for</em> him without taking care <em>of</em> him. For that which does good purposely, is better than what does not good purposely. But nothing is better than God. And to do good purposely, is nothing else than to take care of man. God therefore cares for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and takes care of him. And He shows this practically, in instructing him by the Word, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> coadjutor of God's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to man. But the good is not said to be good, on account of its being possessed of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; as also righteousness is not said to be good on account of its possessing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash; for it is itself <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash; but on account of its being in itself and by itself good.</p>

<p>In another way the useful is called good, not on account of its pleasing, but of its doing good. All which, therefore, is righteousness, being a good thing, both as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and as desirable for its own sake, and not as giving pleasure; for it does not judge in order to win favour, but dispenses to each according to his merits. And the beneficial follows the useful. Righteousness, therefore, has characteristics corresponding to all the aspects in which goodness is examined, both possessing equal properties equally. And things which are characterized by equal properties are equal and similar to each other. Righteousness is therefore a good thing.</p>

<p><q>How then,</q> say they, <q>if the Lord loves man, and is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is He <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and punishes?</q> We must therefore treat of this point with all possible brevity; for this mode of treatment is advantageous to the right training of the children, occupying the place of a necessary help. For many of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are cured by punishment, and by the inculcation of the sterner precepts, as also by instruction in certain principles. For reproof is, as it were, the surgery of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are, as it were, an abscess of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  which must be cut open by an incision of the lancet of reproof.</p>

<p>Reproach is like the application of medicines, dissolving the callosities of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and purging the impurities of the lewdness of the life; and in addition, reducing the excrescences of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, restoring the patient to the healthy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of humanity.</p>

<p>Admonition is, as it were, the regimen of the diseased <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, prescribing what it must take, and forbidding what it must not. And all these tend to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> health.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the general of an army, by inflicting fines and corporeal punishments with chains and the extremest disgrace on offenders, and sometimes even by punishing individuals with death, aims at good, doing so for the admonition of the officers under him.</p>

<p>Thus also He who is our great General, the Word, the Commander-in-chief of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, by admonishing those who throw off the restraints of His law, that He may effect their release from the slavery, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and captivity of the adversary, brings them peacefully to the sacred concord of citizenship.</p>

<p>As, therefore in addition to persuasive discourse, there is the hortatory and the consolatory form; so also, in addition to the laudatory, there is the inculpatory and reproachful. And this latter constitutes the art of censure. Now censure is a mark of good-will, not of ill-will. For both he who is a friend and he who is not, reproach; but the enemy does so in scorn, the friend in kindness. It is not, then, from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> that the Lord chides men; for He Himself suffered for us, whom He might have destroyed for our faults. For the Instructor also, in virtue of His being good, with consummate art glides into censure by rebuke; rousing the sluggishness of the mind by His sharp words as by a scourge. Again in turn He endeavours to exhort the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For those who are not induced by praise are spurred on by censure; and those whom censure calls not forth to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> being as dead, are by denunciation roused to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>For the stripes and correction of wisdom are in all time.</q> <q>For teaching a fool is gluing a potsherd; and sharpening to sense a hopeless blockhead is bringing earth to sensation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021177"><a href="../bible/sir022.htm#verse6">Sirach&nbsp;22:6-8</a></span> Wherefore He adds plainly, <q>rousing the sleeper from deep sleep,</q> which of all things else is likest death.</p>

<p>Further, the Lord shows very clearly of Himself, when, describing figuratively His manifold and in many ways serviceable culture,&mdash; He says, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</q> Then He adds, <q>Every branch in me that bears not fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bring forth more fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021178"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;15:1-2</a></span> For the vine that is not pruned grows to wood. So also man. The Word&mdash; the knife&mdash; clears away the wanton shoots; compelling the impulses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to fructify, not to indulge in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Now, reproof addressed to sinners has their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for its aim, the word being harmoniously adjusted to each one's conduct; now with tightened, now with relaxed cords. Accordingly it was very plainly said by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>: God has drawn near to try you, that His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> may be among you, that you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021179"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;20:20</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who had learned from this source, says beautifully: <q>For all who suffer punishment are in reality treated well, for they are benefited; since the spirit of those who are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished is improved.</q> And if those who are corrected receive good at the hands of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, what is just is acknowledged to be good, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> itself does good, and has been found to be for men's good. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that fears the Lord shall live, for their hope is in Him who saves them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021180"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse14">Sirach&nbsp;34:14-15</a></span> And this same Word who inflicts punishment is judge; regarding whom Esaias also says, <q>The Lord has assigned Him to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021181"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;53:6</a></span> plainly as a corrector and reformer of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore He alone is able to forgive our iniquities, who has been appointed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Instructor of us all; He alone it is who is able to distinguish between disobedience and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. And while He threatens, He manifestly is unwilling to inflict <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to execute His threatenings; but by inspiring men with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, He cuts off the approach to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and shows His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, still delaying, and declaring what they shall suffer if they continue sinners, and is not as a serpent, which the moment it fastens on its prey devours it.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And the Lord speaks many a time and oft before He proceeds to act. <q>For my arrows,</q> He says, <q>will make an end of them; they shall be consumed with hunger, and be eaten by birds; and there shall be incurable tetanic incurvature. I will send the teeth of wild beasts upon them, with the rage of serpents creeping on the earth. Without, the sword shall make them childless; and out of their chambers shall be <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021182"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:23-25</a></span> For the Divine Being is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in the way that some think; but often restrains, and always exhorts humanity, and shows what ought to be done. And this is a good device, to terrify lest we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord drives away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and he that is without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> cannot be justified,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021183"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse21">Sirach&nbsp;1:21-22</a></span> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>.

Each one of us, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> chooses punishment, and the blame lies with him who chooses.

<p>See how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of goodness, seeks repentance; and by means of the plan He pursues of threatening silently, shows His own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for man. <q>I will avert,</q> He says, <q>My face from them, and show what shall happen to them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021189"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:20</a></span> For where the face of the Lord looks, there is peace and rejoicing; but where it is averted, there is the introduction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The Lord, accordingly, does not wish to look on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things; for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But on His looking away, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises spontaneously through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> unbelief. <q>Behold, therefore,</q> says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity; but upon you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021190"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;11:22</a></span> that is, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> attends the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, in virtue of His being in nature good. Wherefore I will grant that He punishes the disobedient (for punishment is for the good and advantage of him who is punished, for it is the correction of a refractory subject); but I will not grant that He wishes to take vengeance. Revenge is retribution for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, imposed for the advantage of him who takes the revenge. He will not desire us to take revenge, who teaches us <q>to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those that despitefully use us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021191"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> But that God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, all willingly admit; and that the same God is just, I require not many more words to prove, after adducing the evangelical utterance of the Lord; He speaks of Him as one, <q>That they all may be one; as You, Father, art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us: that the world also may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You have sent Me.

Of this also the book of Wisdom plainly says, <q>For mercy and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> are with Him, for He alone is Lord of both,</q> Lord of propitiations, and pouring forth <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> according to the abundance of His mercy. <q>So also is His reproof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021199"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;16:12</a></span> For the aim of mercy and of reproof is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who are reproved.</p>

<p>Now, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself will again avouch: <q>For He is kind to the unthankful and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> and further, when He says, <q>Be merciful, as your Father is merciful.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021200"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;6:35-36</a></span> Still further also He plainly says, <q>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but My Father, who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021201"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;19:17</a></span> In addition to these, again He says, <q>My Father makes His sun to shine on all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021202"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> Here it is to be noted that He proclaims His Father to be good, and to be the Creator. And that the Creator is just, is not disputed. And again he says, <q>My Father sends rain on the just, and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> In respect of His sending rain, He is the Creator of the waters, and of the clouds. And in respect of His doing so on all, He holds an even balance <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and rightly. And as being good, He does so on just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> alike.</p>

<p>Very clearly, then, we conclude Him to be one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has sung, <q>I will look to the heavens, the works of Your hands;</q>  and, <q>He who created the heavens dwells in the heavens;</q> and, <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is Your throne.</q>  And the Lord says in His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Our Father, who art in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021205"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;6:9</a></span> And the heavens belong to Him, who created the world. It is indisputable, then, that the Lord is the Son of the Creator. And if, the Creator above all is confessed to be just, and the Lord to be the Son of the Creator; then the Lord is the Son of Him who is just. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021206"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;3:21-22</a></span> and again, that you may better conceive of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>even the righteousness of God by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> upon all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; for there is no difference.</q>  And, witnessing further to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he adds after a little, <q>through the forbearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to show that He is just, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the justifier of him who is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> And that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that what is just is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, appears by his saying, <q>So that the law is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021208"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;7:12</a></span> using both names to denote the same power. But <q>no one is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> except His Father. It is this same Father of His, then, who being one is manifested by many powers. And this was the import of the utterance, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021209"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a>; <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;17:25</a></span> who was Himself everything before the coming of the Son. So that it is veritably clear that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all is only one good, just Creator, and the Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. But it is not inconsistent with the saving Word, to administer rebuke dictated by solicitude. For this is the medicine of the divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by which the blush of modesty breaks forth, and shame at <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> supervenes. For if one must censure, it is necessary also to rebuke; when it is the time to wound the apathetic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not mortally, but salutarily, securing exemption from everlasting death by a little pain.</p>

<p>Great is the wisdom displayed in His instruction, and manifold the modes of His dealing in order to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For the Instructor testifies to the good, and summons forth to better things those that are called; dissuades those that are hastening to do wrong from the attempt, and exhorts them to turn to a better life. For the one is not without testimony, when the other has been testified to; and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which proceeds from the testimony is very great. Besides, the feeling of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (if it is proper to call His admonition <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>) is full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, God condescending to emotion on man's account; for whose sake also the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> became man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. That It is the Prerogative of the Same Power to Be Beneficent and to Punish Justly. Also the Manner of the Instruction of the Logos</h2>

<p>With all His power, therefore, the Instructor of humanity, the Divine Word, using all the resources of wisdom, devotes Himself to the saving of the children, admonishing, upbraiding, blaming, chiding, reproving, threatening, healing, promising, favouring; and as it were, by many reins, curbing the irrational impulses of humanity. To speak briefly, therefore, the Lord acts towards us as we do towards our children. <q>Do you have children? Correct them,</q> is the exhortation of the book of Wisdom, <q>and bend them from their youth. Do you have daughters? Attend to their body, and let not your face brighten towards them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021210"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse23">Sirach&nbsp;7:23-24</a></span> &mdash; although we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our children exceedingly, both sons and daughters, above anything else whatever. For those who speak with a man merely to please him, have little <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him, seeing they do not pain him; while those that speak for his good, though they inflict pain for the time, do him good for ever after. It is not immediate pleasure, but future enjoyment, that the Lord has in view.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to consider the mode of His loving discipline, with the aid of the prophetic testimony.</p>

<p>Admonition, then, is the censure of loving care, and produces understanding. Such is the Instructor in His admonitions, as when He says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>How often would I have gathered your children, as a bird gathers her young ones under her wings, and you would not!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021211"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37</a></span> And again, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> admonishes, saying, <q>And they committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with stock and stone, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.</q>  For it is a very great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that, though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well the shamelessness of the people that had kicked and bounded away, He notwithstanding exhorts them to repentance, and says by Ezekiel, <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, you dwell in the midst of scorpions; nevertheless, speak to them, if perhaps they will hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021213"><a href="../bible/eze002.htm#verse6">Ezekiel&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> Further, to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He says, <q>Go and tell <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> to send My people forth; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will not send them forth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021214"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse18">Exodus&nbsp;3:18-19</a></span> For He shows both things: both His divinity in His foreknowledge of what would take place, and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in affording an opportunity for repentance to the self-determination of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He admonishes also by Esaias, in His care for the people, when He says, <q>This people <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</q> What follows is reproving censure: <q>In vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021215"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> Here His loving care, having shown their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, shows <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> side by side.</p>

<p>Upbraiding is censure on account of what is base, conciliating to what is noble. This is shown by Jeremiah: <q>They were female-mad horses; each one neighed after his neighbour's wife. Shall I not visit for these things? Says the Lord: shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be avenged on such a nation as this?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021216"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8-9</a></span> He everywhere interweaves <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the beginning of sense.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021217"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;1:7</a></span> And again, by Hosea, He says, <q>Shall I not visit them? For they themselves were mingled with harlots, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> with the initiated; and the people that understood embraced a harlot.</q>  He shows their offense to be clearer, by declaring that they understood, and thus <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> wilfully. Understanding is the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; wherefore also <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> means, <q>he that sees God</q>&mdash; that is, he that understands God.</p>

<p>Complaint is censure of those who are regarded as despising or neglecting. He employs this form when He says by Esaias: <q>Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, I have begotten and brought up children, but they have disregarded Me. The ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021219"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> For how shall we not regard it fearful, if he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall not recognise the Lord; but while the ox and the ass, stupid and foolish animals, will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him who feeds them, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is found to be more irrational than these? And having, by Jeremiah, complained against the people on many grounds, He adds: <q>And they have forsaken Me, says the Lord .</q> </p>

<p>Invective  is a reproachful upbraiding, or chiding censure. This mode of treatment the Instructor employs in Isaiah, when He says, <q>Woe to you, children revolters. Thus says the Lord, You have taken counsel, but not by Me; and made compacts, but not by My Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021222"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;30:1</a></span> He uses the very bitter mordant of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in each case repressing  the people, and at the same time turning them to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; as also wool that is undergoing the process of dyeing is wont to be previously treated with mordants, in order to prepare it for taking on a fast colour.</p>

<p>Reproof is the bringing forward of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, laying it before one. This form of instruction He employs as in the highest degree necessary, by reason of the feebleness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many. For He says by Esaias, <q>You have forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021224"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And He says also by Jeremiah: <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> was astonished at this, and the earth shuddered exceedingly. For My people have committed two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and have hewn out to themselves broken cisterns, which will not be able to hold water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021225"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> And again, by the same: <q>Jerusalem has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; therefore it became commotion. All that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> her dishonoured her, when they saw her baseness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021226"><a href="../bible/lam001.htm#verse8">Lamentations&nbsp;1:8</a></span> And He uses the bitter and biting  language of reproof in His consolations by Solomon, tacitly alluding to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for children that characterizes His instruction: <q>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when you are rebuked of Him: for whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021228"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;3:11-12</a></span> <q>For a man who is a sinner escapes reproof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021229"><a href="../bible/sir032.htm#verse21">Sirach&nbsp;32:21</a></span> Consequently, therefore, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Let the righteous reprove and correct me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.</q> </p>

<p>Bringing one to his senses (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) is censure, which makes a man think. Neither from this form of instruction does he abstain, but says by Jeremiah, <q>How long shall I cry, and you not hear? So your ears are uncircumcised.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021231"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> O blessed forbearance! And again, by the same: <q>All the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are uncircumcised, but this people is uncircumcised in heart:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021232"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse26">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:26</a></span> <q>for the people are disobedient; children,</q> says He, <q>in whom is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021233"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;30:9</a></span> </p>

<p>Visitation is severe rebuke. He uses this species in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> them that are sent unto you!</q> The reduplication of the name gives strength to the rebuke. For he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how does he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> God's servants? Wherefore He says, <q>Your house is left desolate; for I say unto you, Henceforth you shall not see Me, till you shall say, Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021234"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37-39</a></span> For if you do not receive His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His power.</p>

<p>Denunciation is vehement speech. And He employs denunciation as medicine, by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, saying, <q>Ah, sinful nation, lawless sons, people full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> seed!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021235"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by John He says, <q>Serpents, brood of vipers.</q> </p> 

<p>Accusation is censure of wrong-doers. This mode of instruction He employs by David, when He says: <q>The people whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not served me, and at the hearing of the ear <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me. Sons of strangers lied to me, and halted from their ways.</q>  And by Jeremiah: <q>And I gave her a writing of divorcement, and covenant-breaking Judah feared not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021238"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:8</a></span> And again: <q>And the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> disregarded Me; and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a> lied to the Lord .</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021239"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>Bewailing one's <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> is latent censure, and by artful aid ministers <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as under a veil. He made use of this by Jeremiah: <q>How did the city sit solitary that was full of people! She that ruled over territories became as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; she came under tribute; weeping, she wept in the night.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021240"><a href="../bible/lam001.htm#verse1">Lamentations&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>Objurgation is objurgatory censure. Of this help the Divine Instructor made use by Jeremiah, saying, <q>You had a whore's forehead; you were shameless towards all; and did not call me to the house, who am your father, and lord of your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021241"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> <q>And a fair and graceful harlot skilled in enchanted potions.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021242"><a href="../bible/nah003.htm#verse4">Nahum&nbsp;3:4</a></span> With consummate art, after applying to the virgin the opprobrious name of whoredom, He thereupon calls her back to an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> life by filling her with shame.</p>

<p>Indignation is a rightful upbraiding; or upbraiding on account of ways exalted above what is right. In this way He instructed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when He said, <q>Faulty children, a generation crooked and perverse, do you thus requite the Lord? This people is foolish, and not wise. Is not this your father who acquired you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021243"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:5-6</a></span> He says also by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, <q>Your princes are disobedient, companions of thieves, loving gifts, following after rewards, not judging the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021244"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;1:23</a></span> </p>

<p>In fine, the system He pursues to inspire <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is the source of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And it is the prerogative of goodness to save: <q>The mercy of the Lord is on all flesh, while He reproves, corrects, and teaches as a shepherd His flock. He pities those who receive His instruction, and those who eagerly seek union with Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021245"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse13">Sirach&nbsp;18:13-14</a></span> And with such guidance He guarded the six hundred thousand footmen that were brought together in the hardness of heart in which they were found; scourging, pitying, striking, healing, in compassion and discipline: <q>For according to the greatness of His mercy, so is His rebuke.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021246"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;16:12</a></span> For it is indeed noble not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also for the sinner to repent; just as it is best to be always in good health, but well to recover from disease. So He commands by Solomon: <q>Strike your son with the rod, that you may deliver his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021247"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse14">Proverbs&nbsp;23:14</a></span> And again: <q>Abstain not from chastising your son, but correct him with the rod; for he will not die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021248"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse13">Proverbs&nbsp;23:13</a></span> </p>

<p>For reproof and rebuke, as also the original term implies, are the stripes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, chastizing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, preventing death, and leading to self-control those carried away to licentiousness. Thus also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> reproof to be the greatest power for reformation, and the most sovereign purification, in accordance with what has been said, observes, <q>that he who is in the highest degree impure is uninstructed and base, by reason of his being unreproved in those respects in which he who is destined to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> ought to be purest and best.</q></p>

<p>For if rulers are not a terror to a good work, how shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is by nature good, be a terror to him who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not? <q>If you do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be afraid,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021249"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;13:3-4</a></span> says the apostle. Wherefore the apostle himself also in every case uses stringent language to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, after the Lord's example; and conscious of his own boldness, and of the weakness of his hearers, he says to the Galatians: <q>Am I your enemy, because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021250"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> Thus also people in health do not require a physician, do not require him as long as they are strong; but those who are ill need his skill. Thus also we who in our lives are ill of shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and reprehensible excesses, and other inflammatory effects of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, need the Saviour. And He administers not only mild, but also stringent medicines. The bitter roots of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> then arrest the eating sores of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is salutary, if bitter. Sick, we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> stand in need of the Saviour; having wandered, of one to guide us; blind, of one to lead us to the light; thirsty, <q>of the fountain of life, of which whosoever partakes, shall no longer thirst;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021251"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;4:13-14</a></span> dead, we need life; sheep, we need a shepherd; we who are children need a tutor, while universal humanity stands in need of Jesus; so that we may not continue intractable and sinners to the end, and thus fall into condemnation, but may be separated from the chaff, and stored up in the paternal garner. <q>For the fan is in the Lord's hand, by which the chaff due to the fire is separated from the wheat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021252"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;3:17</a></span> You may learn, if you will, the crowning wisdom of the all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Shepherd and Instructor, of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> and paternal Word, when He figuratively represents Himself as the Shepherd of the sheep. And He is the Tutor of the children. He says therefore by Ezekiel, directing His discourse to the elders, and setting before them a salutary description of His wise solicitude: <q>And that which is lame I will bind up, and that which is sick I will heal, and that which has wandered I will turn back; and I will feed them on my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.</q>  Such are the promises of the good Shepherd.</p>

<p>Feed us, the children, as sheep. Yea, Master, fill us with righteousness, Your own pasture; yea, O Instructor, feed us on Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which towers aloft, which is above the clouds, which touches heaven. <q>And I will be,</q> He says, <q>their Shepherd,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021254"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse14">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:14-16</a></span> and will be near them, as the garment to their skin. He wishes to save my flesh by enveloping it in the robe of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and He has anointed my body. <q>They shall call Me,</q> He says, <q>and I will say, Here am I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021255"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;58:9</a></span> You heard sooner than I expected, Master. <q>And if they pass over, they shall not slip,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021256"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;43:2</a></span> says the Lord. For we who are passing over to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> shall not fall into corruption, for He shall sustain us. For so He has said, and so He has willed. Such is our Instructor, righteously good. <q>I came not,</q> He says, <q>to be ministered unto, but to minister.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021257"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse45">Mark&nbsp;10:45</a></span> Wherefore He is introduced in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <q>wearied,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021258"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;4:6</a></span> because toiling for us, and promising <q>to give His life a ransom for many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021259"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> For him alone who does so He owns to be the good shepherd. Generous, therefore, is He who gives for us the greatest of all gifts, His own life; and beneficent exceedingly, and loving to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that, when He might have been Lord, He wished to be a brother man; and so good was He that He died for us.</p>

<p>Further, His righteousness cried, <q>If you come straight to me, I also will come straight to you but if you walk crooked, I also will walk crooked, says the Lord of hosts;</q>  meaning by the crooked ways the chastisements of sinners. For the straight and natural way which is indicated by the <em>Iota</em> of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is His goodness, which is firm and sure towards those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at hearing: <q>When I called, you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not, says the Lord; but set at nought my counsels, and heeded not my reproofs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021261"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;1:24-25</a></span> Thus the Lord's reproof is most beneficial. David also says of them, <q>A perverse and provoking race; a race which set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not faithful with God: they kept not the covenant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and would not walk in His law.</q> </p>

<p>Such are the causes of provocation for which the Judge comes to inflict punishment on those that would not choose a life of goodness. Wherefore also afterwards He assailed them more roughly; in order, if possible, to drag them back from their impetuous rush towards death. He therefore tells by David the most manifest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the threatening: <q>They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>. When He slew them, they sought after Him, and turned and inquired early after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and remembered that God was their Helper, and God the Most High their Redeemer.</q>  Thus He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they turned for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, while they despised His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: for, for the most part, that goodness which is always mild is despised; but He who admonishes by the loving <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of righteousness is reverenced.</p>

<p>There is a twofold species of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, the one of which is accompanied with reverence, such as citizens show towards good rulers, and we towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as also right-minded children towards their fathers. <q>For an unbroken horse turns out unmanageable, and a son who is let take his own way turns out reckless.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021264"><a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse8">Sirach&nbsp;30:8</a></span> The other species of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is accompanied with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which slaves feel towards hard masters, and the Hebrews felt, who made God a master, not a father. And as far as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is concerned, that which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and spontaneous differs much, nay entirely, from what is forced. <q>For He,</q> it is said, <q>is merciful; He will heal their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not destroy them, and fully turn away His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and not kindle all His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q>  See how the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the Instructor, which deals in rebukes, is shown; and the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which deals in compassions. Wherefore David&mdash; that is, the Spirit by him&mdash; embracing them both, sings of God Himself, <q>Justice and judgment are the preparation of His throne: mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall go before Your face.</q>  He declares that it belongs to the same power both to judge and to do good. For there is power over both together, and judgment separates that which is just from its opposite. And He who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God is just and good; who is Himself all, and all is He; for He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the only God.</p>

<p>For as the mirror is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to an ugly man because it shows him what like he is; and as the physician is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the sick man because he tells him of his fever&mdash;for the physician is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the fever, but only points out the fever&mdash;so neither is He, that reproves, ill-disposed towards him who is diseased in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For He does not put the transgressions on him, but only shows the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are there; in order to turn him away from similar practices. So God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on His own account, and just also on ours, and He is just because He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is shown to us by His own Word from there from above, whence the Father was. For before He became Creator He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; He was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And therefore He wished to be Creator and Father. And the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was the source of righteousness&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, too, of His lighting up His sun, and sending down His own Son. And He first announced the good righteousness that is from heaven, when He said, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; nor the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021267"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> This mutual and reciprocal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of primeval <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> came down to men both in the letter and in the body, in the Word and in the law, constraining humanity to saving repentance; for it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But do you not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God? Then blame yourself, who drag to yourself the judge.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. That the Same God, by the Same Word, Restrains from Sin by Threatening, and Saves Humanity by Exhorting</h2>

<p>If, then, we have shown that the plan of dealing stringently with humanity is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and salutary, and necessarily adopted by the Word, and conducive to repentance and the prevention of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; we shall have now to look in order at the mildness of the Word. For He has been demonstrated to be just. He sets before us His own inclinations which invite to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; by which, in accordance with the Father's will, He wishes to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us the good and the useful. Consider these. The good (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>) belongs to the panegyrical form of speech, the useful to the persuasive. For the hortatory and the dehortatory are a form of the persuasive, and the laudatory and inculpatory of the panegyrical.</p>

<p>For the persuasive style of sentence in one form becomes hortatory, and in another dehortatory. So also the panegyrical in one form becomes inculpatory, and in another laudatory. And in these exercises the Instructor, the Just One, who has proposed our advantage as His aim, is chiefly occupied. But the inculpatory and dehortatory forms of speech have been already shown us; and we must now handle the persuasive and the laudatory, and, as on a beam, balance the equal scales of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The exhortation to what is useful, the Instructor employs by Solomon, to the following effect: <q>I exhort you, O men; and I utter my voice to the sons of men. Hear me; for I will speak of excellent things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021268"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;8:4,&nbsp;6</a></span> and so on. And He counsels what is salutary: for counsel has for its end, choosing or refusing a certain course; as He does by David, when He says, <q>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsels of the ungodly, and stands not in the way of sinners, and sits not in the chair of pestilences; but his will is in the law of the Lord .</q>  And there are three departments of counsel: That which takes examples from past times; as what the Hebrews suffered when they worshipped the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>, and what they suffered when they committed fornication, and the like. The second, whose meaning is understood from the present times, as being apprehended by perception; as it was said to those who asked the Lord, <q>If He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, or shall we wait for another? Go and tell John, the blind receive their sight, the deaf hear, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> are cleansed, the dead are raised up; and blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me.</q>  Such was that which David said when he prophesied, <q>As we have heard, so have we seen.</q>  And the third department of counsel consists of what is future, by which we are bidden guard against what is to happen; as also that was said, <q>They that fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be cast into outer darkness, where there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth,</q>  and the like. So that from these things it is clear that the Lord, going the round of all the methods of curative treatment, calls humanity to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>By encouragement He assuages <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, reducing <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and at the same time inspiring hope for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For He says by Ezekiel, <q>If you return with your whole heart, and say, Father, I will hear you, as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people.</q>  And again He says, <q>Come all to Me, who labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021274"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> and that which is added the Lord speaks in His own person. And very clearly He calls to goodness by Solomon, when He says, <q>Blessed is the man who has found wisdom, and the mortal who has found understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021275"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse13">Proverbs&nbsp;3:13</a></span> <q>For the good is found by him who seeks it, and is wont to be seen by him who has found it.</q>  By Jeremiah, too, He sets forth <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, when he says, Blessed are we, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us; <span class="stiki" id="note021277"><a href="../bible/bar004.htm#verse4">Baruch&nbsp;4:4</a></span> &mdash; and it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the Word, by whom we are blessed and wise. For wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are mentioned by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when he says, <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the commandments of life, and give ear to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021278"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse9">Baruch&nbsp;3:9</a></span> By <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, too, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> He has to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He promises a gift to those who hasten to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For He says, <q>And I will bring you into the good land, which the Lord swore to your fathers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021279"><a href="../bible/deu031.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy&nbsp;31:20</a></span> And further, <q>And I will bring you into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, and make you glad,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021280"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;56:7</a></span> He says by Isaiah. And still another form of instruction is benediction. <q>And blessed is he,</q> He says by David, <q>who has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; and he shall be as the tree planted near the channels of the waters, which will yield its fruit in its season, and his leaf shall not wither</q>  (by this He made an allusion to the resurrection); <q>and whatsoever he shall do shall prosper with him.</q> Such He wishes us to be, that we may be blessed. Again, showing the opposite scale of the balance of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, He says, <q>But not so the ungodly&mdash; not so; but as the dust which the wind sweeps away from the face of the earth.</q>  By showing the punishment of sinners, and their easy dispersion, and carrying off by the wind, the Instructor dissuades from crime by means of punishment; and by holding up the merited penalty, shows the benignity of His beneficence in the most skilful way, in order that we may possess and enjoy its blessings. He invites us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also, when He says by Jeremiah, <q>Had you walked in the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would have dwelt for ever in peace;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021283"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse13">Baruch&nbsp;3:13</a></span> for, exhibiting there the reward of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, He calls the wise to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of it. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, He says, <q>Turn, turn, as a grape-gatherer to his basket.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021284"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Do you see the goodness of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in that it counsels to repentance? And still further, by Jeremiah, He enlightens in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> those who have erred. <q>Thus says the Lord, Stand in the ways, and look, and ask for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> paths of the Lord, what is the good path, and walk in it, and you shall find purification for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021285"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:16</a></span> And in order to promote our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, He leads us to repentance. Wherefore He says, <q>If you repent, the Lord will purify your heart, and the heart of your seed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021286"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:6</a></span> We might have adduced, as supporters on this question, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who say that only the perfect man is worthy of praise, and the bad man of blame. But since some <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> beatitude, as neither itself taking any trouble, nor giving any to any one else, thus not understanding its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to man; on their account, and on account of those who do not associate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with goodness, the following remarks are added. For it were a legitimate inference to say, that rebuke and censure are suitable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, since they say that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are bad; but God alone is wise, from whom comes wisdom, and alone perfect, and therefore alone worthy of praise. But I do not employ such language. I say, then, that praise or blame, or whatever resembles praise or blame, are medicines most essential of all to men. Some are ill to cure, and, like iron, are wrought into shape with fire, and hammer, and anvil, that is, with threatening, and reproof, and chastisement; while others, cleaving to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself, as self-taught, and as acting of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, grow by praise:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is praised <br>Grows like a tree.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And comprehending this, as it seems to me, the Samian Pythagoras gives the injunction:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>When you have done base things, rebuke <em>yourself;</em> <br>But when you have done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, be glad.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Chiding is also called admonishing; and the etymology of admonishing (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) is (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>) putting of understanding into one; so that rebuking is bringing one to one's senses.</p>

<p>But there are myriads of injunctions to be found, whose aim is the attainment of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the avoidance of what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>For there is no peace to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord .</q>  Wherefore by Solomon He commands the children to beware: <q>My son, let not sinners deceive you, and go not after their ways; and go not, if they entice you, saying, Come with us, share with us in innocent blood, and let us hide <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> the righteous man in the earth; let us put him out of sight, all alive as he is into Hades.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021288"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;1:10-12</a></span> This is accordingly likewise a prediction concerning the Lord's passion. And by Ezekiel, the life supplies commandments: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall die; but he that does righteousness shall be righteous. He eats not upon the mountains, and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and will not defile his neighbour's wife, and will not approach to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in her separation, and will not oppress a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and will restore the debtor's pledge, and will not take plunder: he will give his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked. His money he will not give on <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and will not take interest; and he will turn away his hand from wrong, and will execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbour. He has walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments to do them. This is a righteous man. He shall surely live, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021289"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:4-9</a></span> These words contain a description of the conduct of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, a notable exhortation to the blessed life, which is the reward of a life of goodness&mdash; everlasting life.</p> 

<h2>Chapter 11. That the Word Instructed by the Law and the Prophets</h2>

<p>The mode of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and His instruction we have shown as we could. Wherefore He Himself, declaring Himself very beautifully, likened Himself to a grain of mustard-seed; <span class="stiki" id="note021290"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;13:31</a>; <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;13:19</a></span> and pointed out the spirituality of the word that is sown, and the productiveness of its nature, and the magnificence and conspicuousness of the power of the word; and besides, intimated that the pungency and the purifying <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of punishment are profitable on account of its sharpness. By the little grain, as it is figuratively called, He bestows <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on all humanity abundantly. Honey, being very sweet, generates bile, as goodness begets contempt, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sinning. But mustard lessens bile, that is, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and stops inflammation, that is, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. From which Word springs the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> temperament (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>).</p>

<p>Accordingly, of old He instructed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and then by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, too, was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. For the law is the training of refractory children. <q>Having feasted to the full,</q> accordingly, it is said, <q>they rose up to play;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021291"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;32:6</a>; <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:7</a></span> senseless repletion with victuals being called <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x1F79;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span> (fodder), not <span class="greek">&#x03B2;&#x03C1;&#x1FF6;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span> (food). And when, having senselessly filled themselves, they senselessly played; on that account the law was given them, and terror ensued for the prevention of transgressions and for the promotion of right actions, securing attention, and so winning to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Instructor, being one and the same Word, and reducing to conformity with the urgent demands of the law. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that it was given to be a <q>schoolmaster to bring us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021292"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;3:24</a></span> So that from this it is clear, that one alone, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, good, just, in the image and likeness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, His Son Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, is our Instructor; to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has entrusted us, as an affectionate father commits his children to a worthy tutor, expressly charging us, <q>This is my beloved Son: hear Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021293"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;17:5</a></span> The divine Instructor is trustworthy, adorned as He is with three of the fairest ornament&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, benevolence, and authority of utterance&mdash;with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for He is the paternal wisdom: <q>All Wisdom is from the Lord, and with Him for evermore;</q>&mdash; with authority of utterance, for He is God and Creator: <q>For all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021294"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> &mdash; and with benevolence, for He alone gave Himself a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for us: <q>For the good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021295"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> and He has so given it. Now, benevolence is nothing but wishing to do good to one's neighbour for his sake.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Instructor Characterized by the Severity and Benignity of Paternal Affection</h2>

<p>Having now accomplished those things, it were a fitting sequel that our instructor Jesus should draw for us the model of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, and train humanity in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the cast and character of the life He enjoins very formidable; nor is it made altogether easy by reason of His benignity. He enjoins His commands, and at the same time gives them such a character that they may be accomplished.</p>

<p>The view I take is, that He Himself formed man of the dust, and regenerated him by water; and made him grow by his Spirit; and trained him by His word to adoption and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, directing him by sacred precepts; in order that, transforming earth-born man into a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and heavenly being by His advent, He might fulfil to the utmost that divine utterance, <q>Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021296"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Christ became the perfect realization of what God spoke; and the rest of humanity is conceived as being created merely in His image.</p>

<p>But let us, O children of the good Father&mdash; nurslings of the good Instructor&mdash; fulfil the Father's will, listen to the Word, and take on the impress of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> saving life of our Saviour; and meditating on the heavenly mode of life according to which we have been deified, let us anoint ourselves with the perennial <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> bloom of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>&mdash; that ointment of sweet fragrance&mdash; having a clear example of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> in the walk and conversation of the Lord; and following the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom alone it belongs to consider, and whose care it is to see to, the way and manner in which the life of men may be made more healthy. Besides, He makes preparation for a self-sufficing mode of life, for simplicity, and for girding up our loins, and for free and unimpeded readiness of our journey; in order to the attainment of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of beatitude, teaching each one of us to be his own storehouse. For He says, <q>Take no anxious thought for tomorrow,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021297"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;6:34</a></span> meaning that the man who has devoted himself to Christ ought to be sufficient to himself, and servant to himself, and moreover lead a life which provides for each day by itself. For it is not in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but in peace, that we are trained. War needs great preparation, and luxury craves profusion; but peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, simple and quiet sisters, require no arms nor excessive preparation. The Word is their sustenance.</p>

<p>Our superintendence in instruction and discipline is the office of the Word, from whom we learn frugality and humility, and all that pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of excellence. And so, in a word, being assimilated to God by a participation in moral excellence, we must not retrograde into carelessness and sloth. But labour, and faint not. You shall be what you do not hope, and canst not conjecture. And as there is one mode of training for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, another for orators, and another for athletes; so is there a generous disposition, suitable to the choice that is set upon moral loveliness, resulting from the training of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And in the case of those who have been trained according to this influence, their gait in walking, their sitting at table, their food, their sleep, their going to bed, their regimen, and the rest of their mode of life, acquire a superior dignity.  For such a training as is pursued by the Word is not overstrained, but is of the right tension. Thus, therefore, the Word has been called also the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, seeing He has found out for men those rational medicines which produce vigour of the senses and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and devotes Himself to watching for the favourable moment, reproving <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, exposing the causes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> affections, and striking at the roots of irrational <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, pointing out what we ought to abstain from, and supplying all the antidotes of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who are diseased. For the greatest and most regal work of God is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of humanity. The sick are vexed at a physician, who gives no advice bearing on their restoration to health. But how shall we not acknowledge the highest gratitude to the divine Instructor, who is not silent, who omits not those threatenings that point towards destruction, but discloses them, and cuts off the impulses that tend to them; and who indoctrinates in those counsels which result in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way of living? We must confess, therefore, the deepest <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to Him. For what else do we say is incumbent on the rational creature&mdash; I mean man&mdash; than the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the Divine? I say, too, that it is requisite to contemplate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and to live as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> directs, and to admire the Instructor and His injunctions, as suitable and harmonious to each other. According to which image also we ought, conforming ourselves to the Instructor, and making the word and our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> agree, to live a real life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Virtue Rational, Sin Irrational</h2>

<p>Everything that is contrary to right reason is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> think fit to define the most generic <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> thus: <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as desire disobedient to reason; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, as weakness disobedient to reason; pleasure, as an elation of the spirit disobedient to reason. If, then, disobedience in reference to reason is the generating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how shall we escape the conclusion, that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to reason&mdash; the Word&mdash; which we call <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, will of necessity be the efficacious <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of duty? For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself is a state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rendered harmonious by reason in respect to the whole life. Nay, to crown all, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself is pronounced to be the cultivation of right reason; so that, necessarily, whatever is done through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of reason is transgression, and is rightly called, (<span class="greek">&#x1F01;&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span>) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since, then, the first man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and disobeyed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is said, <q>And man became like to the beasts:</q>  being rightly regarded as irrational, he is likened to the beasts. Whence Wisdom says: <q>The horse for covering; the libidinous and the adulturer has become like to an irrational beast.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021300"><a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse6">Sirach&nbsp;33:6</a></span> Wherefore also it is added: <q>He neighs, whoever may be sitting on him.</q> The man, it is meant, no longer speaks; for he who transgresses against reason is no longer rational, but an irrational animal, given up to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> by which he is ridden (as a horse by his rider).</p>

<p>But that which is done right, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to reason, the followers of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> call <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1FC6;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1FC6;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, that is, incumbent and fitting. What is fitting is incumbent. And <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is founded on commands. And these being, as they are, the same as counsel&mdash; having <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for their aim, train up to the ultimate goal of aspiration, which is conceived of as the <em>end</em> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>). And the end of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is our end. The right operation of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> perfects duty by works; whence, according to just reasoning, duties consist in actions, not in sayings. And <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conduct is the operation of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in accordance with a correct judgment and aspiration after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which attains its destined end through the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> consort and ally.  Virtue is a will in conformity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ in life, rightly adjusted to life everlasting. For the life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in which we are now trained, is a system of reasonable actions&mdash; that is, of those things taught by the Word&mdash; an unfailing energy which we have called <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The system is the commandments of the Lord, which, being divine <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and spiritual counsels, have been written for ourselves, being adapted for ourselves and our neighbours. Moreover, they turn back on us, as the ball rebounds on him that throws it by the repercussion. Whence also duties are essential for divine discipline, as being enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and furnished for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And since, of those things which are necessary, some relate only to life here, and others, which relate to the blessed life yonder, wing us for flight hence; so, in an analogous manner, of duties, some are ordained with reference to life, others for the blessed life. The commandments issued with respect to natural life are published to the multitude; but those that are suited for living well, and from which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life springs, we have to consider, as in a sketch, as we read them out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</p>
