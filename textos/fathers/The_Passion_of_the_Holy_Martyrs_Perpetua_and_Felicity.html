<h1>The Passion of the Holy Martyrs Perpetua and Felicity</h1>

<h2>Preface.</h2> 

<p>If ancient illustrations of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which both testify to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and tend to man's edification are collected in writing, so that by the perusal of them, as if by the reproduction of the facts, as well God may be honoured, as man may be strengthened; why should not new instances be also collected, that shall be equally suitable for both purposes&mdash;if only on the ground that these modern examples will one day become ancient and available for posterity, although in their present time they are esteemed of less authority, by reason of the presumed veneration for antiquity? But let men look to it, if they judge the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be one, according to the times and seasons; since some things of later date must be esteemed of more account as being nearer to the very last times, in accordance with the exuberance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> manifested to the final periods determined for the world. For <q>in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy. And upon my servants and my handmaidens will I pour out of my Spirit; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</q>  And thus we&mdash; who both acknowledge and reverence, even as we do the prophecies, modern visions as equally promised to us, and consider the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as an agency of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for which also He was sent, administering all gifts in all, even as the Lord distributed to every one  as well needfully collect them in writing, as commemorate them in reading to God's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; that so no weakness or despondency of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may suppose that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> abode only among the ancients, whether in respect of the condescension that raised up <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, or that gave revelations; since God always carries into effect what He has promised, for a testimony to unbelievers, to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> for a benefit. And we therefore, what we have heard and handled, declare also to you, brethren and little children, that as well you who were concerned in these matters may be reminded of them again to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, as that you who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by report may have communion with the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and through them with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, for ever and ever.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Argument.&mdash; When the Saints Were Apprehended, St. Perpetua Successfully Resisted Her Father's Pleading, Was Baptized with the Others, Was Thrust into a Filthy Dungeon. Anxious About Her Infant, by a Vision Granted to Her, She Understood that Her Martyrdom Would Take Place Very Shortly</h2>

<p>1. The young <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, Revocatus and his fellow-servant Felicitas, Saturninus and Secundulus, were apprehended. And among them also was Vivia Perpetua, respectably born, liberally <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, a married matron, having a father and mother and two brothers, one of whom, like herself, was a catechumen, and a son an infant at the breast. She herself was about twenty-two years of age. From this point onward she shall herself narrate the whole course of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as she left it described by her own hand and with her own mind.</p>

<p>2. <q>While</q> says she, we were still with the persecutors, and my father, for the sake of his affection for me, was persisting in seeking to turn me away, and to cast me down from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;'Father,' said I, 'do you see, let us say, this vessel lying here to be a little pitcher, or something else?' And he said, 'I see it to be so.' And I replied to him, 'Can it be called by any other name than what it is?' And he said, 'No.' 'Neither can I call myself anything else than what I am, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.' Then my father, provoked at this saying, threw himself upon me, as if he would tear my eyes out. But he only distressed me, and went away overcome by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> arguments. Then, in a few days after I had been without my father, I gave thanks to the Lord; and his absence became a source of consolation  to me. In that same interval of a few days we were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and to me the Spirit prescribed that in the water <em>of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em> nothing else was to be sought for bodily endurance.  After a few days we are taken into the dungeon, and I was very much afraid, because I had never felt such darkness. O terrible day! O the fierce heat of the shock of the soldiery, because of the crowds! I was very unusually distressed by my anxiety for my infant. There were present there Tertius and Pomponius, the blessed <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who ministered to us, and had arranged by means of a gratuity that we might be refreshed by being sent out for a few hours into a pleasanter part of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Then going out of the dungeon, all attended to their own wants.  I suckled my child, which was now enfeebled with hunger. In my anxiety for it, I addressed my mother and comforted my brother, and commended to their care my son. I was languishing because I had seen them languishing on my account. Such solicitude I suffered for many days, and I obtained for my infant to remain in the dungeon with me; and immediately I grew strong and was relieved from distress and anxiety about my infant; and the dungeon became to me as it were a palace, so that I preferred being there to being elsewhere.</p>

<p>3. Then my brother said to me, 'My dear sister, you are already in a position of great dignity, and are such that you may ask for a vision, and that it may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you whether this is to result in a passion or an escape.'  And I, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that I was privileged to converse with the Lord, whose kindnesses I had found to be so great, boldly promised him, and said, 'Tomorrow I will tell you.' And I asked, and this was what was shown me. I saw a golden ladder of marvellous height, reaching up even to heaven, and very narrow, so that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> could only ascend it one by one; and on the sides of the ladder was fixed every kind of iron weapon. There were there swords, lances, hooks, daggers; so that if any one went up carelessly, or not looking upwards, he would be torn to pieces and his flesh would cleave to the iron weapons. And under the ladder itself was crouching a dragon of wonderful size, who lay in wait for those who ascended, and frightened them from the ascent. And Saturus went up first, who had subsequently delivered himself up freely on our account, not having been present at the time that we were taken prisoners. And he attained the top of the ladder, and turned towards me, and said to me, 'Perpetua, I am waiting for  you; but be careful that the dragon do not bite you.' And I said, 'In the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, he shall not hurt me.' And from under the ladder itself, as if in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of me, he slowly lifted up his head; and as I trod upon the first step, I trod upon his head. And I went up, and I saw an immense extent of garden, and in the midst of the garden a white-haired man sitting in the dress of a shepherd,  of a large stature, milking sheep; and standing around were many thousand white-robed ones. And he raised his head, and looked upon me, and said to me, 'You are welcome, daughter.' And he called me, and from the cheese as he was milking he gave me as it were a little cake, and I received it with folded hands; and I ate it, and all who stood around said <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And at the sound of their voices I was awakened, still tasting a sweetness which I cannot describe. And I immediately related this to my brother, and we understood that it was to be a passion, and we ceased henceforth to have any hope in this world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Argument. Perpetua, When Besieged by Her Father, Comforts Him. When Led with Others to the Tribunal, She Avows Herself a Christian, and is Condemned with the Rest to the Wild Beasts. She Prays for Her Brother Dinocrates, Who Was Dead</h2>

<p>1. After a few days there prevailed a report that we should be heard. And then my father came to me from the city, worn out with anxiety. He came up to me, that he might cast me down, saying, 'Have pity my daughter, on my grey hairs. Have pity on your father, if I am worthy to be called a father by you. If with these hands I have brought you up to this flower of your age, if I have preferred you to all your brothers, do not deliver me up to the scorn of men. Have regard to your brothers, have regard to your mother and your aunt, have regard to your son, who will not be able to live after you. Lay aside your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and do not bring us all to destruction; for none of us will speak in freedom if you should suffer anything.' These things said my father in his affection, kissing my hands, and throwing himself at my feet; and with tears he called me not Daughter, but Lady. And I grieved over the grey hairs of my father, that he alone of all my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> would not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over my passion. And I comforted him, saying, 'On that scaffold  whatever God wills shall happen. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are not placed in our own power, but in that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' And he departed from me in sorrow.</p>

<p>2. Another day, while we were at dinner, we were suddenly taken away to be heard, and we arrived at the town-hall. At once the rumour spread through the neighbourhood of the public place, and an immense number of people were gathered together. We mount the platform. The rest were interrogated, and confessed. Then they came to me, and my father immediately appeared with my boy, and withdrew me from the step, and said in a supplicating tone, 'Have pity on your babe.' And Hilarianus the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, who had just received the power of life and death in the place of the proconsul Minucius Timinianus, who was deceased, said, 'Spare the grey hairs of your father, spare the infancy of your boy, offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the well-being of the emperors.' And I replied, 'I will not do so.' Hilarianus said, 'Are you a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?' And I replied, 'I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.' And as my father stood there to cast me down <em>from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, he was ordered by Hilarianus to be thrown down, and was beaten with rods. And my father's misfortune grieved me as if I myself had been beaten, I so grieved for his wretched old age.  The <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> then delivers judgment on all of us, and condemns us to the wild beasts, and we went down cheerfully to the dungeon. Then, because my child had been used to receive suck from me, and to stay with me in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, I send Pomponius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to my father to ask for the infant, but my father would not give it him. And even as God willed it, the child no long desired the breast, nor did my breast <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me uneasiness, lest I should be tormented by care for my babe and by the pain of my breasts at once.</p>

<p>3. After a few days, while we were all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, on a sudden, in the middle of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, there came to me a word, and I named Dinocrates; and I was amazed that that name had never come into my mind until then, and I was grieved as I remembered his misfortune. And I felt myself immediately to be worthy, and to be called on to ask on his behalf.  And for him I began earnestly to make supplication, and to cry with groaning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Without delay, on that very night, this was shown to me in a vision.  I saw Dinocrates going out from a gloomy place, where also there were several others, and he was parched and very thirsty, with a filthy countenance and pallid colour, and the wound on his face which he had when he died. This Dinocrates had been my brother after the flesh, seven years of age  who died miserably with disease&mdash; his face being so eaten out with cancer, that his death caused repugnance to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For him I had made my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and between him and me there was a large interval,  so that neither of us could approach to the other. And moreover, in the same place where Dinocrates was, there was a pool full of water, having its brink higher than was the stature of the boy; and Dinocrates raised himself up as if to drink. And I was grieved that, although that pool held water, still, on account of the height to its brink, he could not drink. And I was aroused, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that my brother was in suffering. But I trusted that my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> would bring help to his suffering; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him every day until we passed over into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of the camp, for we were to fight in the camp-show. Then was the birth-day of Geta C&aelig;sar, and I made my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for my brother day and night, groaning and weeping that he might be granted to me.</p>

<p>4. Then, on the day on which we remained in fetters,  this was shown to me. I saw that that place which I had formerly observed to be in gloom was now bright; and Dinocrates, with a clean body well clad, was finding refreshment. And where there had been a wound, I saw a scar; and that pool which I had before seen, <em>I saw now</em> with its margin lowered even to the boy's navel. And one drew water from the pool incessantly, and upon its brink was a goblet filled with water; and Dinocrates drew near and began to drink from it, and the goblet did not fail. And when he was satisfied, he went away from the water to play joyously, after the manner of children, and I awoke. Then I understood that he was translated from the place of punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Argument. Perpetua is Again Tempted by Her Father. Her Third Vision, Wherein She is Led Away to Struggle Against an Egyptian. She Fights, Conquers, and Receives the Reward</h2>

<p>1. Again, after a few days, Pudens, a soldier, an assistant overseer  of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, who began to regard us in great esteem, perceiving that the great power of God was in us, admitted many brethren to see us, that both we and they might be mutually refreshed. And when the day of the exhibition drew near, my father, worn with suffering, came in to me, and began to tear out his beard, and to throw himself on the earth, and to cast himself down on his face, and to reproach his years, and to utter such words as might move all creation. I grieved for his unhappy old age. </p>

<p>2. <q>The day before that on which we were to fight, I saw in a vision that Pomponius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> came hither to the gate of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and knocked vehemently. I went out to him, and opened the gate for him; and he was clothed in a richly ornamented white robe, and he had on manifold callicul&aelig;.  And he said to me, 'Perpetua, we are waiting for you; come!' And he held his hand to me, and we began to go through rough and winding places. Scarcely at length had we arrived breathless at the amphitheatre, when he led me into the middle of the arena, and said to me, 'Do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, I am here with you, and I am labouring with you;' and he departed. And I gazed upon an immense assembly in astonishment. And because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that I was given to the wild beasts, I marvelled that the wild beasts were not let loose upon me. Then there came forth against me a certain <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, horrible in appearance, with his backers, to fight with me. And there came to me, as my helpers and encouragers, handsome youths; and I was stripped, and became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  Then my helpers began to rub me with oil, as is the custom for contest; and I beheld that <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> on the other hand rolling in the dust.  And a certain man came forth, of wondrous height, so that he even over-topped the top of the amphitheatre; and he wore a loose tunic and a purple robe between two bands over the middle of the breast; and he had on <em>callicul&aelig;</em> of varied form, made of gold and silver; and he carried a rod, as if he were a trainer of gladiators, and a green branch upon which were apples of gold. And he called for silence, and said, 'This <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, if he should overcome this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, shall kill her with the sword; and if she shall conquer him, she shall receive this branch.' Then he departed. And we drew near to one another, and began to deal out blows. He sought to lay hold of my feet, while I struck at his face with my heels; and I was lifted up in the air, and began thus to thrust at him as if spurning the earth. But when I saw that there was some delay I joined my hands so as to twine my fingers with one another; and I took hold upon his head, and he fell on his face, and I trod upon his head.  And the people began to shout, and my backers to exult. And I drew near to the trainer and took the branch; and he kissed me, and said to me, 'Daughter, peace be with you:' and I began to go <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> to the Sanavivarian gate.  Then I awoke, and perceived that I was not to fight with beasts, but against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Still I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the victory was awaiting me. This, so far, I have completed several days before the exhibition; but what passed at the exhibition itself let who will write.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Argument. Saturus, in a Vision, and Perpetua Being Carried by Angels into the Great Light, Behold the Martyrs. Being Brought to the Throne of God, are Received with a Kiss. They Reconcile Optatus the Bishop and Aspasius the Presbyter</h2>

<p>1. Moreover, also, the blessed Saturus related this his vision, which he himself committed to writing:&mdash; <q>We had suffered,</q> says he, and we had gone forth from the flesh, and we were beginning to be borne by four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into the east; and their hands touched us not. And we floated not supine, looking upwards, but as if ascending a gentle slope. And being set free, we at length saw the first boundless light; and I said, 'Perpetua' (for she was at my side), 'this is what the Lord promised to us; we have received the promise.' And while we are borne by those same four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, there appears to us a vast space which was like a pleasure-garden, having rose-trees and every kind of flower. And the height of the trees was after the measure of a cypress, and their leaves were falling  incessantly. Moreover, there in the pleasure-garden four other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appeared, brighter than the previous ones, who, when they saw us, gave us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and said to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, 'Here they are! Here they are!' with admiration. And those four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who bore us, being greatly afraid, put us down; and we passed over on foot the space of a furlong in a broad path. There we found Jocundus and Saturninus and Artaxius, who having suffered the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> were burnt alive; and Quintus, who also himself a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> had departed in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And we asked of them where the rest were. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said to us, 'Come first, enter and greet your Lord.'</p>

<p>2. And we came near to place, the walls of which were such as if they were built of light; and before the gate of that place stood four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who clothed those who entered with white robes. And being clothed, we entered and saw the boundless light, and heard the united voice of some who said without ceasing, 'Holy! Holy! Holy!'  And in the midst of that place we saw as it were an old man sitting, having snow-white hair, and with a youthful countenance; and his feet we saw not. And on his right hand and on his left were four-and-twenty elders, and behind them a great many others were standing. We entered with great wonder, and stood before the throne; and the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> raised us up, and we kissed Him, and He passed His hand over our face. And the rest of the elders said to us, 'Let us stand;' and we stood and made peace. And the elders said to us, 'Go and enjoy.' And I said, 'Perpetua, you have what you wish.' And she said to me, 'Thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that joyous as I was in the flesh, I am now more joyous here.'</p>

<p>3. <q>And we went forth, and saw before the entrance Optatus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the right hand, and Aspasius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, a teacher,  at the left hand, separate and sad; and they cast themselves at our feet, and said to us, 'Restore peace between us, because you have gone forth and have left us thus.' And we said to them, 'Are you not our father, and you our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, that you should cast yourselves at our feet?' And we prostrated ourselves, and we embraced them; and Perpetua began to speak with them, and we drew them apart in the pleasure-garden under a rose-tree. And while we were speaking with them, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said unto them, 'Let them alone, that they may refresh themselves;  and if you have any dissensions between you, forgive one another.' And they drove them away. And they said to Optatus, 'Rebuke your people, because they assemble to you as if returning from the circus, and contending about factious matters.' And then it seemed to us as if they would shut the doors. And in that place we began to recognise many brethren, and moreover <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. We were all nourished with an indescribable odour, which satisfied us. Then, I joyously awoke.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Argument. Secundulus Dies in the Prison. Felicitas is Pregnant, But with Many Prayers She Brings Forth in the Eighth Month Without Suffering, the Courage of Perpetua and of Saturus Unbroken</h2>

<p>1. The above were the more eminent visions of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Saturus and Perpetua themselves, which they themselves committed to writing.  But God called Secundulus, while he has yet in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, by an earlier exit from the world, not without favour, so as to give a respite to the beasts. Nevertheless, even if his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not acknowledge <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for thankfulness, assuredly his flesh did.</p>

<p>2. But respecting Felicitas (for to her also the Lord's favour approached in the same way), when she had already gone eight months with child (for she had been pregnant when she was apprehended), as the day of the exhibition was drawing near, she was in great grief lest on account of her pregnancy she should be delayed&mdash;because pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not allowed to be publicly punished&mdash;and lest she should shed her sacred and guiltless blood among some who had been <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> subsequently. Moreover, also, her fellow <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were painfully saddened lest they should leave so excellent a friend, and as it were companion, alone in the path of the same hope. Therefore, joining together their united cry, they poured forth their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Lord three days before the exhibition. Immediately after their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> her pains came upon her, and when, with the difficulty natural to an eight months' delivery, in the labour of bringing forth she was sorrowing, some one of the servants of the <em>Cataractarii</em>  said to her, <q>You who are in such suffering now, what will you do when you are thrown to the beasts, which you despised when you refused to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>?</q> And she replied, <q>Now it is I that suffer what I suffer; but then there will be another in me, who will suffer for me, because I also am about to suffer for Him.</q> Thus she brought forth a little girl, which a certain sister brought up as her daughter.</p>

<p>3. Since then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> permitted, and by permitting willed, that the proceedings of that exhibition should be committed to writing, although we are unworthy to complete the description of so great a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; yet we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> as it were the command of the most blessed Perpetua, nay her sacred trust, and add one more testimony concerning her constancy and her loftiness of mind. While they were treated with more severity by the tribune, because, from the intimations of certain deceitful men, he feared lest they should be withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by some sort of magic incantations, Perpetua answered to his face, and said, <q>Why do you not at least permit us to be refreshed, being as we are objectionable to the most noble C&aelig;sar, and having to fight on his birth-day?  Or is it not your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> if we are brought forward fatter on that occasion?</q> The tribune shuddered and blushed, and commanded that they should be kept with more humanity, so that permission was given to their brethren and others to go in and be refreshed with them; even the keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> trusting them now himself.</p>

<p>4. Moreover, on the day before, when in that last meal, which they call the free meal, they were partaking as far as they could, not of a free supper, but of an <em>agape</em>; with the same firmness they were uttering such words as these to the people, denouncing <em>against them</em> the judgment of the Lord, bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the felicity of their passion, laughing at the curiosity of the people who came together; while Saturus said, <q>Tomorrow is not enough for you, for you to behold with pleasure that which you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Friends today, enemies tomorrow. Yet note our faces diligently, that you may recognise them on that day of judgment.</q> Thus all departed thence astonished, and from these things many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Argument. From the Prison They are Led Forth with Joy into the Amphitheatre, Especially Perpetua and Felicitas. All Refuse to Put on Profane Garments. They are Scourged, They are Thrown to the Wild Beasts. Saturus Twice is Unhurt. Perpetua and Felicitas are Thrown Down; They are Called Back to the Sanavivarian Gate. Saturus Wounded by a Leopard, Exhorts the Soldier. They Kiss One Another, and are Slain with the Sword</h2>

<p>1. The day of their victory shone forth, and they proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> into the amphitheatre, as if to an assembly, joyous and of brilliant countenances; if perchance shrinking, it was with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and not with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Perpetua followed with placid look, and with step and gait as a matron of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; casting down the luster of her eyes from the gaze of all. Moreover, Felicitas, rejoicing that she had safely brought forth, so that she might fight with the wild beasts; from the blood and from the midwife to the gladiator, to wash after childbirth with a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And when they were brought to the gate, and were constrained to put on the clothing&mdash; the men, that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Saturn, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that of those who were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Ceres&mdash; that noble-minded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> resisted even to the end with constancy. For she said, <q>We have come thus far of our own accord, for this reason, that our liberty might not be restrained. For this reason we have yielded our minds, that we might not do any such thing as this: we have agreed on this with you.</q> Injustice acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; the tribune yielded to their being brought as simply as they were. Perpetua sang psalms, already treading under foot the head of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>; Revocatus, and Saturninus, and Saturus uttered threatenings against the gazing people about this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. When they came within sight of Hilarianus, by gesture and nod, they began to say to Hilarianus, <q>You judge us,</q> say they, <q>but God will judge you.</q> At this the people, exasperated, demanded that they should be tormented with scourges as they passed along the rank of the <em>venatores</em>.  And they indeed rejoiced that they should have incurred any one of their Lord's <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</p>

<p>2. But He who had said, <q>Ask, and you shall receive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note039006"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;16:24</a></span> gave to them when they asked, that death which each one had wished for. For when at any time they had been discoursing among themselves about their wish in respect of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Saturninus indeed had professed that he wished that he might be thrown to all the beasts; doubtless that he might wear a more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> crown. Therefore in the beginning of the exhibition he and Revocatus made trial of the leopard, and moreover upon the scaffold they were harassed by the bear. Saturus, however, held nothing in greater abomination than a bear; but he imagined that he would be put an end to with one bite of a leopard. Therefore, when a wild boar was supplied, it was the huntsman rather who had supplied that boar who was gored by that same beast, and died the day after the shows. Saturus only was drawn out; and when he had been bound on the floor near to a bear, the bear would not come forth from his den. And so Saturus for the second time is recalled unhurt.</p>

<p>3. Moreover, for the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> prepared a very fierce cow, provided especially for that purpose contrary to custom, rivalling their sex also in that of the beasts. And so, stripped and clothed with nets, they were led forth. The populace shuddered as they saw one young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of delicate frame, and another with breasts still dropping from her recent childbirth. So, being recalled, they are unbound.  Perpetua is first led in. She was tossed, and fell on her loins; and when she saw her tunic torn from her side, she drew it over her as a veil for her middle, rather mindful of her modesty than her suffering. Then she was called for again, and bound up her dishevelled hair; for it was not becoming for a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to suffer with dishevelled hair, lest she should appear to be mourning in her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. So she rose up; and when she saw Felicitas crushed, she approached and gave her her hand, and lifted her up. And both of them stood together; and the brutality of the populace being appeased, they were recalled to the Sanavivarian gate. Then Perpetua was received by a certain one who was still a catechumen, Rusticus by name, who kept close to her; and she, as if aroused from sleep, so deeply had she been in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, began to look round her, and to say to the amazement of all, <q>I cannot tell when we are to be led out to that cow.</q> And when she had heard what had already happened, she did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it  until she had perceived certain signs of injury in her body and in her dress, and had recognised the catechumen. Afterwards causing that catechumen and the brother to approach, she addressed them, saying, <q>Stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, all of you, and be not offended at my sufferings.</q></p>

<p>4. The same Saturus at the other entrance exhorted the soldier Pudens, saying, <q>Assuredly here I am, as I have promised and foretold, for up to this moment I have felt no beast. And now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with your whole heart. Lo, I am going forth to that beast, and I shall be destroyed with one bite of the leopard.</q> And immediately at the conclusion of the exhibition he was thrown to the leopard; and with one bite of his he was bathed with such a quantity of blood, that the people shouted out to him as he was returning, the testimony of his second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <q>Saved and washed, saved and washed.</q>  Manifestly he was assuredly saved who had been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in such a spectacle. Then to the soldier Pudens he said, <q>Farewell, and be mindful of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and let not these things disturb, but confirm you.</q> And at the same time he asked for a little ring from his finger, and returned it to him bathed in his wound, leaving to him an inherited token and the memory of his blood. And then lifeless he is cast down with the rest, to be slaughtered in the usual place. And when the populace called for them into the midst, that as the sword penetrated into their body they might make their eyes partners in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, they rose up of their own accord, and transferred themselves whither the people wished; but they first kissed one another, that they might consummate their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace. The rest indeed, immoveable and in silence, received the sword-thrust; much more Saturus, who also had first ascended the ladder, and first gave up his spirit, for he also was waiting for Perpetua. But Perpetua, that she might taste some pain, being pierced between the ribs, cried out loudly, and she herself placed the wavering right hand of the youthful gladiator to her throat.  Possibly such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> could not have been slain unless she herself had willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.</p>

<p>O most brave and blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>! O <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called and chosen unto the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>! Whom whoever magnifies, and honours, and adores, assuredly ought to read these examples for the edification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not less than the ancient ones, so that new <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> also may testify that one and the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is always operating even until now, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Omnipotent, and His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, whose is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
