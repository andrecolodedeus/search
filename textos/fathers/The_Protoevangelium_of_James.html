<h1>The Protoevangelium of James</h1>

<p> <em>The Birth of Mary the Holy <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and Very Glorious Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</em> </p>

<p>1. In the records of the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was Joachim, a man rich exceedingly; and he brought his offerings double,  saying: There shall be of my superabundance to all the people, and there shall be the offering for my forgiveness  to the Lord for a propitiation for me.  For the great day of the Lord was at hand, and the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were bringing their offerings. And there stood over against him Rubim, saying: It is not meet for you first to bring your offerings, because you have not made seed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.  And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and went away to the registers of the twelve tribes of the people, saying: I shall see the registers of the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as to whether I alone have not made seed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he searched, and found that all the righteous had raised up seed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he called to mind the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that in the last day  God gave him a son Isaac. And Joachim was exceedingly grieved, and did not come into the presence of his wife; but he retired to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,  and there pitched his tent, and fasted forty days and forty nights,  saying in himself: I will not go down either for food or for drink until the Lord my God shall look upon me, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be my food and drink.</p>

<p>2. And his wife Anna  mourned in two mournings, and lamented in two lamentations, saying: I shall bewail my widowhood; I shall bewail my childlessness. And the great day of the Lord was at hand; and Judith  her maid-servant said: How long do you humiliate your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand, and it is unlawful for you to mourn. But take this head-band, which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that made it gave to me; for it is not proper that I should wear it, because I am a maid-servant, and it has a royal appearance.  And Anna said: Depart from me; for I have not done such things, and the Lord has brought me very low. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> person has given it to you, and you have come to make me a sharer in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And Judith said: Why should I curse you, seeing that  the Lord has shut your womb, so as not to give you fruit in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And Anna was grieved exceedingly, and put off her garments of mourning, and cleaned her head, and put on her wedding garments, and about the ninth hour went down to the garden to walk. And she saw a laurel, and sat under it, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord, saying: O God of our fathers, bless me and hear my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as You blessed the womb of Sarah, and gave her a son Isaac. </p>

<p>3. And gazing towards the heaven, she saw a sparrow's nest in the laurel, <span class="stiki" id="note081567"><a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse10">Tobit&nbsp;2:10</a></span> and made a lamentation in herself, saying: Alas! Who begot me? And what womb produced me? Because I have become a curse in the presence of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and I have been reproached, and they have driven me in derision out of the temple of the Lord. Alas! To what have I been likened? I am not like the fowls of the heaven, because even the fowls of the heaven are productive before You, O Lord. Alas! To what have I been likened? I am not like the beasts of the earth, because even the beasts of the earth are productive before You, O Lord. Alas! To what have I been likened? I am not like these waters, because even these waters are productive before You, O Lord. Alas! To what have I been likened? I am not like this earth, because even the earth brings forth its fruits in season, and blesses You, O Lord. </p>

<p>4. And, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord stood by, saying: Anna, Anna, the Lord has heard your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and you shall conceive, and shall bring forth; and your seed shall be spoken of in all the world. And Anna said: As the Lord my God lives, if I beget either male or female, I will bring it as a gift to the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it shall minister to Him in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things all the days of its life. <span class="stiki" id="note081569"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:11</a></span> And, behold, two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came, saying to her: Behold, Joachim your husband is coming with his flocks.  For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord went down to him, saying: Joachim, Joachim, the Lord God has heard your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Go down hence; for, behold, your wife Anna shall conceive. And Joachim went down and called his shepherds, saying: Bring me hither ten she-lambs without spot or blemish, and they shall be for the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and bring me twelve tender calves, and they shall be for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the elders; and a hundred goats for all the people. And, behold, Joachim came with his flocks; and Anna stood by the gate, and saw Joachim coming, and she ran and hung upon his neck, saying: Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord God has blessed me exceedingly; for, behold the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> no longer a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and I the childless shall conceive. And Joachim rested the first day in his house.</p>

<p>5. And on the following day he brought his offerings, saying in himself: If the Lord God has been rendered gracious to me, the plate  on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> forehead will make it manifest to me. And Joachim brought his offerings, and observed attentively the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> plate when he went up to the altar of the Lord, and he saw no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in himself. And Joachim said: Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord has been gracious unto me, and has remitted all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And he went down from the temple of the Lord justified, and departed to his own house. And her months were fulfilled, and in the ninth  month Anna brought forth. And she said to the midwife: What have I brought forth? And she said: A girl. And said Anna: My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been magnified this day. And she laid her down. And the days having been fulfilled, Anna was purified, and gave the breast to the child,  and called her name Mary.</p>

<p>6. And the child grew strong day by day; and when she was six  months old, her mother set her on the ground to try whether she could stand, and she walked seven steps and came into her bosom; and she snatched her up, saying: As the Lord my God lives, you shall not walk on this earth until I bring you into the temple of the Lord. And she made a sanctuary in her bed-chamber, and allowed nothing common or unclean to pass through her. And she called the undefiled daughters of the Hebrews, and they led her astray.  And when she was a year old, Joachim made a great feast, and invited the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and the elders, and all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And Joachim brought the child to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and they blessed her, saying: O God of our fathers, bless this child, and give her an everlasting name to be named in all generations. And all the people said: So be it, so be it, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>. And he brought her to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and they blessed her, saying: O God most high, look upon this child, and bless her with the utmost blessing, which shall be for ever. And her mother snatched her up, and took her into the sanctuary of her bed-chamber, and gave her the breast. And Anna made a song to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, saying: I will sing a song to the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He has looked upon me, and has taken away the reproach of mine enemies; and the Lord has given the fruit of His righteousness, singular in its kind, and richly endowed before Him. Who will tell the sons of Rubim that Anna gives suck? Hear, hear, you twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that Anna gives suck. And she laid her to rest in the bed-chamber of her sanctuary, and went out and ministered unto them. And when the supper was ended, they went down rejoicing, and glorifying the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. </p>

<p>7. And her months were added to the child. And the child was two years old, and Joachim said: Let us take her up to the temple of the Lord, that we may pay the vow that we have vowed, lest perchance the Lord send to us,  and our offering be not received. And Anna said: Let us wait for the third year, in order that the child may not seek for father or mother. And Joachim said: So let us wait. And the child was three years old, and Joachim said: Invite the daughters of the Hebrews that are undefiled, and let them take each a lamp, and let them stand with the lamps burning, that the child may not turn back, and her heart be captivated from the temple of the Lord. And they did so until they went up into the temple of the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> received her, and kissed her, and blessed her, saying: The Lord has magnified your name in all generations. In you, on the last of the days, the Lord will manifest His redemption to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he set her down upon the third step of the altar, and the Lord God sent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> upon her; and she danced with her feet, and all the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> loved her.</p>

<p>8. And her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> went down marvelling, and praising the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, because the child had not turned back. And Mary was in the temple of the Lord as if she were a dove that dwelt there, and she received food from the hand of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. And when she was twelve  years old there was held a council of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying: Behold, Mary has reached the age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord. What then shall we do with her, lest perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord? And they said to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>:  You stand    by the altar of the Lord; go in, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> concerning her; and whatever the Lord shall manifest unto you, that also will we do. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> went in, taking the robe  with the twelve bells into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies; and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> concerning her. And behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord stood by him, saying unto him: Zacharias, Zacharias, go out and assemble the widowers of the people, and let them bring each his rod; and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall she be. And the heralds went out through all the circuit of Jud&aelig;a, and the trumpet of the Lord sounded, and all ran.</p>

<p>9. And Joseph, throwing away his axe, went out to meet them; and when they had assembled, they went away to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, taking with them their rods. And he, taking the rods of all of them, entered into the temple, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; and having ended his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he took the rods and came out, and gave them to them: but there was no sign in them, and Joseph took his rod last; and, behold, a dove came out of the rod, and flew upon Joseph's head. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said to Joseph, You have been chosen by lot to take into your keeping the virgin of the Lord. But Joseph refused, saying: I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girl. I am afraid lest I become a laughing-stock to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said to Joseph: Fear the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and remember what the Lord did to Dathan, and Abiram, and Korah; <span class="stiki" id="note081580"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse31">Numbers&nbsp;16:31-33</a></span> how the earth opened, and they were swallowed up on account of their contradiction. And now <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, O Joseph, lest the same things happen in your house. And Joseph was afraid, and took her into his keeping. And Joseph said to Mary: Behold, I have received you from the temple of the Lord; and now I leave you in my house, and go away to build my buildings, and I shall come to you. The Lord will protect you.</p>

<p>10. And there was a council of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying: Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Call to me the undefiled <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David. And the officers went away, and sought, and found seven <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remembered the child Mary, that she was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, and undefiled before God. And the officers went away and brought her. And they brought them into the temple of the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Choose for me by lot who shall spin the gold, and the white,  and the fine linen, and the silk, and the blue,  and the scarlet, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> purple. <span class="stiki" id="note081583"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;25:4</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> purple and the scarlet fell to the lot of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and she took them, and went away to her house. And at that time Zacharias was dumb, and Samuel was in his place until the time that Zacharias spoke. And Mary took the scarlet, and span it.</p>

<p>11. And she took the pitcher, and went out to fill it with water. And, behold, a voice saying: Hail, you who hast received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; the Lord is with you; blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>! <span class="stiki" id="note081584"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;1:28</a></span> And she looked round, on the right hand and on the left, to see whence this voice came. And she went away, trembling, to her house, and put down the pitcher; and taking the purple, she sat down on her seat, and drew it out. And, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord stood before her, saying: Fear not, Mary; for you have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before the Lord of all, and you shall conceive, according to His word. And she hearing, reasoned with herself, saying: Shall I conceive by the Lord, the living God? And shall I bring forth as every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> brings forth? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord said: Not so, Mary; for the power of the Lord shall overshadow you: wherefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of the Most High. And you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And Mary said: Behold, the servant of the Lord before His face: let it be unto me according to your word.</p>

<p>12. And she made the purple and the scarlet, and took them to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> blessed her, and said: Mary, the Lord God has magnified your name, and you shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in all the generations of the earth. And Mary, with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, went away to <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a> her kinswoman, <span class="stiki" id="note081585"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;1:39-40</a></span> and knocked at the door. And when <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a> heard her, she threw away the scarlet,  and ran to the door, and opened it; and seeing Mary, she blessed her, and said: Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, behold, that which is in me leaped and blessed you. <span class="stiki" id="note081587"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;1:34,&nbsp;44</a></span> But Mary had forgotten the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of which the archangel Gabriel had spoken, and gazed up into heaven, and said: Who am I, O Lord, that all the generations of the earth should bless me? <span class="stiki" id="note081588"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;1:48</a></span> And she remained three months with <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>; and day by day she grew bigger. And Mary being afraid, went away to her own house, and hid herself from the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And she was sixteen  years old when these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> happened.</p>

<p>13. And she was in her sixth month; and, behold, Joseph came back from his building, and, entering into his house, he discovered that she was big with child. And he smote  his face,  and threw himself on the ground upon the sackcloth, and wept bitterly, saying: With what face shall I look upon the Lord my God? And what <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall I make about this maiden? Because I received her a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> out of the temple of the Lord, and I have not watched over her. Who is it that has hunted me  down? Who has done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing in my house, and defiled the virgin? Has not the history of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> been repeated in me? For just as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was in the hour of his singing praise,  and the serpent came, and found Eve alone, and completely deceived her, so it has happened to me also. And Joseph stood up from the sackcloth, and called Mary, and said to her: O you who hast been cared for by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have you done this and forgotten the Lord your God? Why have you brought low your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, you that wast brought up in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, and that received food from the hand of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? And she wept bitterly, saying: I am innocent, and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> no man. And Joseph said to her: Whence then is that which is in your womb? And she said: As the Lord my God lives, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence it is to me.</p>

<p>14. And Joseph was greatly afraid, and retired from her, and considered what he should do in regard to her. <span class="stiki" id="note081594"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;1:19</a></span> And Joseph said: If I conceal her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I find myself fighting against the law of the Lord; and if I expose her to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, I am afraid lest that which is in her be from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,  and I shall be found giving up innocent blood to the doom of death. What then shall I do with her? I will put her away from me secretly. And night came upon him; and, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appears to him in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, saying: Be not afraid for this maiden, for that which is in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081596"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> And Joseph arose from sleep, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who had given him this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and he kept her.</p>

<p>15. And Annas the scribe came to him, and said: Why have you not appeared in our assembly? And Joseph said to him: Because I was weary from my journey, and rested the first day. And he turned, and saw that Mary was with child. And he ran away to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>,  and said to him: Joseph, whom you vouched for, has committed a grievous crime. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: How so? And he said: He has defiled the virgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord, and has married her by stealth, and has not revealed it to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> answering, said: Has Joseph done this? Then said Annas the scribe: Send officers, and you will find the virgin with child. And the officers went away, and found it as he had said; and they brought her along with Joseph to the tribunal. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Mary, why have you done this? And why have you brought your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> low, and forgotten the Lord your God? You that wast reared in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, and that received food from the hand of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and heard the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and danced before Him, why have you done this? And she wept bitterly, saying: As the Lord my God lives, I am pure before Him, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said to Joseph: Why have you done this? And Joseph said: As the Lord lives, I am pure concerning her. Then said the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: Bear not false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, but speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. You have married her by stealth, and hast not revealed it to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and hast not bowed your head under the strong hand, that your seed might be blessed. And Joseph was silent.</p>

<p>16. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Give up the virgin whom you received out of the temple of the Lord. And Joseph burst into tears. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: I will give you to drink of the water of the ordeal of the Lord,  and He shall make manifest your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in your eyes. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> took the water, and gave Joseph to drink and sent him away to the hill-country; and he returned unhurt. And he gave to Mary also to drink, and sent her away to the hill-country; and she returned unhurt. And all the people wondered that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did not appear in them. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: If the Lord God has not made manifest your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, neither do I judge you. And he sent them away. And Joseph took Mary, and went away to his own house, rejoicing and glorifying the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</p>

<p>17. And there was an order from the Emperor Augustus, that all in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a should be enrolled. <span class="stiki" id="note081599"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;2:1</a></span> And Joseph said: I shall enrol my sons, but what shall I do with this maiden? How shall I enrol her? As my wife? I am ashamed. As my daughter then? But all the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that she is not my daughter. The day of the Lord shall itself bring it to pass  as the Lord will. And he saddled the ass, and set her upon it; and his son led it, and Joseph followed.  And when they had come within three miles, Joseph turned and saw her sorrowful; and he said to himself: Likely that which is in her distresses her. And again Joseph turned and saw her laughing. And he said to her: Mary, how is it that I see in your face at one time laughter, at another sorrow? And Mary said to Joseph: Because I see two peoples with my eyes; the one weeping and lamenting, and the other rejoicing and exulting. And they came into the middle of the road, and Mary said to him: Take me down from off the ass, for that which is in me presses to come forth. And he took her down from off the ass, and said to her: Whither shall I lead you, and cover your disgrace? For the place is desert.</p>

<p>18. And he found a cave  there, and led her into it; and leaving his two sons beside her, he went out to seek a widwife in the district of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</p>

<p>And I Joseph was walking, and was not walking; and I looked up into the sky, and saw the sky astonished; and I looked up to the pole of the heavens, and saw it standing, and the birds of the air keeping still. And I looked down upon the earth, and saw a trough lying, and work-people reclining: and their hands were in the trough. And those that were eating did not eat, and those that were rising did not carry it up, and those that were conveying anything to their mouths did not convey it; but the faces of all were looking upwards. And I saw the sheep walking, and the sheep stood still; and the shepherd raised his hand to strike them, and his hand remained up. And I looked upon the current of the river, and I saw the mouths of the kids resting on the water and not drinking, and all things in a moment were driven from their course.</p>

<p>19. And I saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> coming down from the hill-country, and she said to me: O man, whither are you going? And I said: I am seeking an Hebrew midwife. And she answered and said unto me: Are you of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And I said to her: Yes. And she said: And who is it that is bringing forth in the cave? And I said: A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to me. And she said to me: Is she not your wife? And I said to her: It is Mary that was reared in the temple of the Lord, and I obtained her by lot as my wife. And yet she is not my wife, but has conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>And the widwife said to him: Is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? And Joseph said to her: Come and see. And the midwife went away with him. And they stood in the place of the cave, and behold a luminous cloud overshadowed the cave. And the midwife said: My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been magnified this day, because my eyes have seen strange things&mdash; because <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been brought forth to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And immediately the cloud disappeared out of the cave, and a great light shone in the cave, so that the eyes could not bear it. And in a little that light gradually decreased, until the infant appeared, and went and took the breast from His mother Mary. And the midwife cried out, and said: This is a great day to me, because I have seen this strange sight. And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. And she said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to you: a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> has brought forth&mdash; a thing which her nature admits not of. Then said Salome: As the Lord my God lives, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the parts, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> has brought forth.</p>

<p>20. And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show yourself; for no small controversy has arisen about you. And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire. And she bent her knees before the Lord, saying: O God of my fathers, remember that I am the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob; do not make a show of me to the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but restore me to the poor; for You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord, that in Your name I have performed my services, and that I have received my reward at Your hand. And, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord stood by her, saying to her: Salome, Salome, the Lord has heard you. Put your hand to the infant, and carry it, and you will have safety and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And Salome went and carried it, saying: I will worship Him, because a great King has been born to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And, behold, Salome was immediately cured, and she went forth out of the cave justified. And behold a voice saying: Salome, Salome, tell not the strange things you have seen, until the child has come into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>21. And, behold, Joseph was ready to go into Jud&aelig;a. And there was a great commotion in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a, for <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> came, saying: Where is he that is born king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him. And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> heard, he was much disturbed, and sent officers to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. And he sent for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and examined them, saying: How is it written about the Christ? Where is He to be born? And they said: In <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a, for so it is written.  And he sent them away. And he examined the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, saying to them: What sign have you seen in reference to the king that has been born? And the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> said: We have seen a star of great size shining among these stars, and obscuring their light, so that the stars did not appear; and we thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that a king has been born to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and we have come to worship him. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> said: Go and seek him; and if you find him, let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, in order that I also may go and worship him. And the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> went out. And, behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them until they came to the cave, and it stood over the top of the cave. And the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> saw the infant with His mother Mary; and they brought forth from their bag gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> not to go into Jud&aelig;a, they went into their own country by another road. </p>

<p>22. And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had been mocked by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, in a rage he sent murderers, saying to them: Slay the children  from two years old and under. And Mary, having heard that the children were being killed, was afraid, and took the infant and swaddled Him, and put Him into an ox-stall. And <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, having heard that they were searching for John, took him and went up into the hill-country, and kept looking where to conceal him. And there was no place of concealment. And <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, groaning with a loud voice, says: O mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receive mother and child. And immediately the mountain was cleft, and received her. And a light shone about them, for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord was with them, watching over them.</p>

<p>23. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> searched for John, and sent officers to Zacharias, saying: Where have you hid your son? And he, answering, said to them: I am the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, and I sit constantly in the temple of the Lord: I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where my son is. And the officers went away, and reported all these things to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was enraged, and said: His son is destined to be king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he sent to him again, saying: Tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; where is your son? For you know that your life is in my hand. And Zacharias said: I am God's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, if you shed my blood; for the Lord will receive my spirit, because you shed innocent blood at the vestibule of the temple of the Lord. And Zacharias was murdered about daybreak. And the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he had been murdered. </p>

<p>24. But at the hour of the salutation the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went away, and Zacharias did not come forth to meet them with a blessing, according to his custom.  And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stood waiting for Zacharias to salute him at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  and to glorify the Most High. And he still delaying, they were all afraid. But one of them ventured to go in, and he saw clotted blood beside the altar; and he heard a voice saying: Zacharias has been murdered, and his blood shall not be wiped up until his avenger come. And hearing this saying, he was afraid, and went out and told it to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And they ventured in, and saw what had happened; and the fretwork of the temple made a wailing noise, and they rent their clothes  from the top even to the bottom. And they found not his body, but they found his blood turned into stone. And they were afraid, and went out and reported to the people that Zacharias had been murdered. And all the tribes of the people heard, and mourned, and lamented for him three days and three nights. And after the three days, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> consulted as to whom they should put in his place; and the lot fell upon Simeon. For it was he who had been warned by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that he should not see death until he should see the Christ in the flesh. </p>

<p>And I James that wrote this history in Jerusalem, a commotion having arisen when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> died, withdrew myself to the wilderness until the commotion in Jerusalem ceased, glorifying the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who had given me the gift and the wisdom to write this history.  And <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> shall be with them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
