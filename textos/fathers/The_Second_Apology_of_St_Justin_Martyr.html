<h1>The Second Apology of St. Justin Martyr</h1>

<p class="h1a">Addressed to the Roman Senate</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Romans, the things which have recently  happened in your city under Urbicus,  and the things which are likewise being everywhere unreasonably done by the governors, have compelled me to frame this composition for your sakes, who are men of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and brethren, though you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not, and though you be unwilling to acknowledge it on account of your glorying in what you esteem dignities.  For everywhere, whoever is corrected by father, or neighbour, or child, or friend, or brother, or husband, or wife, for a fault, for being hard to move, for loving pleasure and being hard to urge to what is right (except those who have been persuaded that the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and intemperate shall be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and those who lived like Christ shall dwell with God in a state that is free from suffering&mdash;we mean, those who have become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and who keep such men as these subject to themselves, and serving them in the capacity of judges, incite them, as rulers actuated by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, to put us to death. But that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all that has taken place under Urbicus may become quite plain to you, I will relate what has been done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Urbicus condemns the Christians to death</h2>

<p>A certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> lived with an intemperate  husband; she herself, too, having formerly been intemperate. But when she came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the teachings of Christ she became sober-minded, and endeavoured to persuade her husband likewise to be temperate, citing the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and assuring him that there shall be punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> inflicted upon those who do not live temperately and conformably to right reason. But he, continuing in the same excesses, alienated his wife from him by his actions. For she, considering it <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to live any longer as a wife with a husband who sought in every way means of indulging in pleasure contrary to the law of nature, and in violation of what is right, wished to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from him. And when she was overpersuaded by her friends, who advised her still to continue with him, in the idea that some time or other her husband might give hope of amendment, she did <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to her own feeling and remained with him. But when her husband had gone into Alexandria, and was reported to be conducting himself worse than ever, she&mdash; that she might not, by continuing in matrimonial connection with him, and by sharing his table and his bed, become a partaker also in his wickednesses and impieties&mdash; gave him what you call a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>,  and was separated from him. But this noble husband of hers&mdash;while he ought to have been rejoicing that those actions which formerly she unhesitatingly committed with the servants and hirelings, when she delighted in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, she had now given up, and desired that he too should give up the same&mdash;when she had gone from him without his desire, brought an accusation against her, affirming that she was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. And she presented a paper to you, the Emperor,  requesting that first she be permitted to arrange her affairs, and afterwards to make her defence against the accusation, when her affairs were set in order. And this you granted. And  her quondam husband, since he was now no longer able to prosecute her, directed his assaults against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Ptolem&aelig;us, whom Urbicus punished, and who had been her teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrines. And this he did in the following way. He persuaded a centurion &mdash; who had cast Ptolem&aelig;us into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and who was friendly to himself&mdash; to take Ptolem&aelig;us and interrogate him on this sole point: whether he were a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? And Ptolem&aelig;us, being a lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not of a deceitful or false disposition, when he confessed himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, was bound by the centurion, and for a long time punished in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> And, at last, when the man  came to Urbicus, he was asked this one question only: whether he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? And again, being conscious of his duty, and the nobility of it through the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he confessed his discipleship in the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For he who denies anything either denies it because he condemns the thing itself, or he shrinks from confession because he is conscious of his own unworthiness or alienation from it, neither of which cases is that of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. And when Urbicus ordered him to be led away to punishment, one Lucius, who was also himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, seeing the unreasonable judgment that had thus been given, said to Urbicus: <q>What is the ground of this judgment? Why have you punished this man, not as an adulterer, nor fornicator, nor murderer, nor thief, nor robber, nor convicted of any crime at all, but who has only confessed that he is called by the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? This judgment of yours, O Urbicus, does not become the <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Emperor Pius</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, the son of C&aelig;sar, nor the sacred senate.</q>  And he said nothing else in answer to Lucius than this: <q>You also seem to me to be such an one.</q> And when Lucius answered, <q>Most certainly I am,</q> he again ordered him also to be led away. And he professed his thanks, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he was delivered from such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rulers, and was going to the Father and King of the heavens. And still a third having come forward, was condemned to be punished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Justin accuses Crescens of ignorant prejudice against the Christians</h2>

<p>I too, therefore, expect to be plotted against and fixed to the stake, by some of those I have named, or perhaps by Crescens, that lover of bravado and boasting;  for the man is not worthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who publicly bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against us in matters which he does not understand, saying that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> and impious, and doing so to win favour with the deluded mob, and to please them. For if he assails us without having read the teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is thoroughly depraved, and far worse than the illiterate, who often refrain from discussing or bearing false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> about matters they do not understand. Or, if he has read them and does not understand the majesty that is in them, or, understanding it, acts thus that he may not be suspected of being such [a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>], he is far more base and thoroughly depraved, being conquered by illiberal and unreasonable opinion and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For I would have you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I proposed to him certain questions on this subject, and interrogated him, and found most convincingly that he, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing. And to prove that I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I am ready, if these disputations have not been reported to you, to conduct them again in your presence. And this would be an act worthy of a prince. But if my questions and his answers have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, you are already aware that he is acquainted with none of our matters; or, if he is acquainted with them, but, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those who might hear him, does not dare to speak out, like Socrates, he proves himself, as I said before, no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but an opinionative man;  at least he does not regard that Socratic and most admirable saying: <q>But a man must in no way be honoured before the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  But it is impossible for a Cynic, who makes indifference his end, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any good but indifference.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Why the Christians do not kill themselves</h2>

<p>But lest some one say to us, <q>Go then all of you and kill yourselves, and pass even now to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not trouble us,</q> I will tell you why we do not so, but why, when examined, we fearlessly confess. We have been taught that God did not make the world aimlessly, but for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and we have before stated that He takes pleasure in those who imitate His properties, and is displeased with those that embrace what is worthless either in word or deed. If, then, we all kill ourselves we shall become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as far as in us lies, why no one should be born, or instructed in the divine doctrines, or even why the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should not exist; and we shall, if we so act, be ourselves acting in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when we are examined, we make no denial, because we are not conscious of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but count it impious not to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in all things, which also we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and because  we are also now very desirous to deliver you from an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> prejudice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. How the angels transgressed</h2>

<p>But if this idea take possession of some one, that if we acknowledge God as our helper, we should not, as we say, be oppressed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; this, too, I will solve. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He had made the whole world, and subjected things earthly to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and arranged the heavenly elements for the increase of fruits and rotation of the seasons, and appointed this divine law&mdash; for these things also He evidently made for man&mdash; committed the care of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of all things under heaven to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whom He appointed over them. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> transgressed this appointment, and were captivated by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and begot children who are those that are called <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and besides, they afterwards subdued the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to themselves, partly by magical writings, and partly by fears and the punishments they occasioned, and partly by teaching them to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and libations, of which things they stood in need after they were enslaved by lustful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> they sowed murders, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, adulteries, intemperate <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Whence also the poets and mythologists, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who had been begotten by them that did these things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and cities, and nations, which they related, ascribed them to god himself, and to those who were accounted to be his very offspring, and to the offspring of those who were called his brothers, Neptune and Pluto, and to the children again of these their offspring. For whatever name each of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had given to himself and his children, by that name they called them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Names of God and of Christ, their meaning and power</h2>

<p>But to the Father of all, who is unbegotten there is no name given. For by whatever name He be called, He has as His elder the person who gives Him the name. But these words Father, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Creator, and Lord, and Master, are not names, but appellations derived from His good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and functions. And His Son, who alone is properly called Son, the Word who also was with Him and was begotten before the works, when at first He created and arranged all things by Him, is called Christ, in reference to His being anointed and God's ordering all things through Him; this name itself also containing an unknown significance; as also the appellation <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> is not a name, but an opinion implanted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of men of a thing that can hardly be explained. But <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>,</q> His name as man and Saviour, has also significance. For He was made man also, as we before said, having been conceived according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for the sake of believing men, and for the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And now you can learn this from what is under your own observation. For numberless <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a> throughout the whole world, and in your city, many of our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men exorcising them in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, have healed and do heal, rendering helpless and driving the possessing devils out of the men, though they could not be cured by all the other exorcists, and those who used incantations and drugs.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The world preserved for the sake of Christians. Man's responsibility</h2>

<p>Wherefore God delays causing the confusion and destruction of the whole world, by which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and men shall cease to exist, because of the seed of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of preservation in nature.  Since, if it were not so, it would not have been possible for you to do these things, and to be impelled by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>; but the fire of judgment would descend and utterly dissolve all things, even as formerly the flood left no one but him only with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who is by us called <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and by you Deucalion, from whom again such vast numbers have sprung, some of them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and others good. For so we say that there will be the conflagration, but not as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, according to their doctrine of all things being changed into one another, which seems most degrading. But neither do we affirm that it is by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> that men do what they do, or suffer what they suffer, but that each man by free choice acts rightly or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that it is by the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that earnest men, such as Socrates and the like, suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and are in bonds, while Sardanapalus, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, and the like, seem to be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in abundance and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, not observing this, maintained that all things take place according to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. But since God in the beginning made the race of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, they will <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suffer in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> the punishment of whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they have committed. And this is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all that is made, to be capable of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For neither would any of them be praiseworthy unless there were power to turn to both [<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>]. And this also is shown by those men everywhere who have made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and philosophized according to right reason, by their prescribing to do some things and refrain from others. Even the Stoic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in their  doctrine of morals, steadily <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the same things, so that it is evident that they are not very felicitous in what they say about principles and incorporeal things. For if they say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions come to pass by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, they will maintain either that God is nothing else than the things which are ever turning, and altering, and dissolving into the same things, and will appear to have had a comprehension only of things that are destructible, and to have looked on God Himself as emerging both in part and in whole in every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>;  or that neither <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is anything; which is contrary to every sound idea, reason, and sense.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. All have been hated in whom the Word has dwelt</h2>

<p>And those of the Stoic school&mdash; since, so far as their moral teaching went, they were admirable, as were also the poets in some particulars, on account of the seed of reason [the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>] implanted in every race of men&mdash; were, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>&mdash;Heraclitus for instance, and, among those of our own time, Musonius and others. For, as we intimated, the devils have always effected, that all those who anyhow live a reasonable and earnest life, and shun <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. And it is nothing wonderful; if the devils are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those to be much worse <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> who live not according to a part only of the word diffused [among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>] but by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the whole Word, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And they, having been shut up in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, shall suffer their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment and penalty. For if they are even now overthrown by men through the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, this is an intimation of the punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> which is to be inflicted on themselves and those who serve them. For thus did both all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretell, and our own teacher Jesus teach. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Eternal punishment not a mere threat</h2>

<p>And that no one may say what is said by those who are deemed <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, that our assertions that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> are big words and bugbears, and that we wish men to live virtuously through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and not because such a life is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and pleasant; I will briefly reply to this, that if this be not so, God does not exist; or, if He exists, He cares not for men, and neither <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is anything, and, as we said before, lawgivers <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> punish those who transgress good commandments. But since these are not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and their Father teaches them by the word to do the same things as Himself, they who agree with them are not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. And if one object that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of men are diverse, and say that with some, one thing is considered good, another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while with others what seemed bad to the former is esteemed good, and what seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is esteemed bad, let him listen to what we say to this. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> conformable to their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in which the men who are like them delight; and the right Reason,  when He came, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that not all opinions nor all doctrines are good, but that some are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while others are good. Wherefore, I will declare the same and similar things to such men as these, and, if need be, they shall be spoken of more at large. But at present I return to the subject.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Christ compared with Socrates</h2>

<p>Our doctrines, then, appear to be greater than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teaching; because Christ, who appeared for our sakes, became the whole rational being, both body, and reason, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For I whatever either lawgivers or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> uttered well, they elaborated by finding and contemplating some part of the Word. But since they I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the whole of the Word, which is Christ, they often contradicted themselves. And those who by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth were more ancient than Christ, when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason, were brought before the tribunals as impious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and busybodies. And Socrates, who was more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in this direction than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as ourselves. For they said that he was introducing new divinities, and did not consider those to be gods whom the state recognised. But he cast out from the state both Homer  and the rest of the poets, and taught men to reject the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and those who did the things which the poets related; and he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God who was to them unknown, by means of the investigation of reason, saying, <q>That it is neither easy to find the Father and Maker of all, nor, having found Him, is it safe to declare Him to all.</q>  But these things our Christ did through His own power. For no one trusted in Socrates so as to die for this doctrine, but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was partially <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even by Socrates (for He was and is the Word who is in every man, and who foretold the things that were to come to pass both through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in His own person when He was made of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and taught these things), not only <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and scholars <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but also artisans and people entirely uneducated, despising both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and  death; since He is a power of the ineffable Father, not the mere instrument of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. How Christians view death</h2>

<p>But neither should we be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, nor would <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and devils be more powerful than we, were not death a debt due by every man that is born. Wherefore we give thanks when we pay this debt. And we judge it right and opportune to tell here, for the sake of Crescens and those who rave as he does, what is related by Xenophon. Hercules, says Xenophon, coming to a place where three ways met, found Virtue and Vice, who appeared to him in the form of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: Vice, in a luxurious dress, and with a seductive expression rendered blooming by such ornaments, and her eyes of a quickly melting tenderness,  said to Hercules that if he would follow her, she would always enable him to pass his life in pleasure and adorned with the most graceful ornaments, such as were then upon her own person; and Virtue, who was of squalid look and dress, said, But if you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me, you shall adorn yourself not with ornament nor beauty that passes away and perishes, but with everlasting and precious graces. And we are persuaded that every one who flees those things that seem to be good, and follows hard after what are reckoned difficult and strange, enters into blessedness. For Vice, when by imitation of what is incorruptible (for what is really incorruptible she neither has nor can produce) she has thrown around her own actions, as a disguise, the properties of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and qualities which are really excellent, leads captive earthly-minded men, attaching to Virtue her own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> properties. But those who understood the excellences which belong to that which is real, are also uncorrupt in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And this every sensible person ought to think both of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and of the athletes, and of those who did what the poets relate of the so-called gods, concluding as much from our contempt of death, even when it could be escaped. </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Christians proved innocent by their contempt of death</h2>

<p>For I myself, too, when I was delighting in the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and heard the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>, and saw them fearless of death, and of all other-things which are counted fearful, perceived that it was impossible that they could be living in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and pleasure. For what sensual or intemperate man, or who that counts it good to feast on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh,  could welcome death that he might be deprived of his enjoyments, and would not rather continue always the present life, and attempt to escape the observation of the rulers; and much less would he denounce himself when the consequence would be death? This also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have now caused to be done by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men. For having put some to death on account of the accusations <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> brought against us, they also dragged to the torture our domestics, either children or weak <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and by dreadful torments forced them to admit those fabulous actions which they themselves openly perpetrate; about which we are the less concerned, because none of these actions are really ours, and we have the unbegotten and ineffable God as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> both of our thoughts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For why did we not even publicly profess that these were the things which we esteemed good, and prove that these are the divine <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, saying that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Saturn are performed when we slay a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that when we drink our fill of blood, as it is said we do, we are doing what you do before that idol you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and on which you sprinkle the blood not only of irrational animals, but also of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, making a libation of the blood of the slain by the hand of the most illustrious and noble man among you? And imitating Jupiter and the other gods in sodomy and shameless intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, might we not bring as our apology the writings of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and the poets? But because we persuade men to avoid such instruction, and all who practise them and imitate such examples, as now in this discourse we have striven to persuade you, we are assailed in every kind of way. But we are not concerned, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> observer of all. But would that even now some one would mount a lofty rostrum, and shout with a loud voice;  <q>Be ashamed, be ashamed, you who charge the guiltless with those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which yourselves openly could commit, and ascribe things which apply to yourselves and to your gods to those who have not even the slightest sympathy with them. Be converted; become wise.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 13. How the Word has been in all men</h2>

<p>For I myself, when I discovered tile <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> disguise which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> had thrown around the divine doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to turn aside others from joining them, laughed both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise itself and at popular opinion and I confess that I both boast and with all my strength  strive to be found a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; not because the teachings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> are different from those of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but because they are not in all respects similar, as neither are those of the others, <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, and poets, and historians. For each man spoke well in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic word,  seeing what was related to it. But they who contradict themselves on the more important points appear not to have possessed the heavenly  wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which cannot be spoken against. Whatever things were rightly said among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are the property of us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For next to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we worship and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Word who is from the unbegotten and ineffable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since also He became man for our sakes, that becoming a partaker of our sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the writers were able to see realities darkly through the sowing of the implanted word that was in them. For the seed and imitation impacted according to capacity is one thing, and quite another is the thing itself, of which there is the participation and imitation according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is from Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Justin prays that this appeal be published</h2>

<p>And we therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to publish this little book, appending what you think right, that our opinions may he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, and that these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may have a fair chalice of being freed from erroneous notions and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of good, who by their own fault have become subject to punishment; that so these things may be published to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because it is in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and by their condemning us, whom they do not understand, for actions which they say are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and by delighting in the gods who did such things, and even now require similar actions from men, and by inflicting on us death or bonds or some other such punishment, as if we were guilty of these things, they condemn themselves, so that there is no need of other judges.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Conclusion</h2>

<p>And I despised the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and deceitful doctrine of Simon  of my own nation. And if you give this book your authority, we will expose him before all, that, if possible, they may be converted. For this end alone did we compose this treatise. And our doctrines are not shameful, according to a sober judgment, but are indeed more lofty than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: and if not so, they are at least unlike the doctrines of the Sotadists, and Phil&aelig;nidians, and Dancers, and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and such other teachings of the poets, which all are allowed to acquaint themselves with both as acted and as written. And henceforth we shall be silent, having done as much as we could, and having added the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere may be counted worthy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And would that you also, in a manner becoming <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  would for your own sakes judge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>!</p>
