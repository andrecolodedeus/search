<h1>The Shepherd of Hermas (Book II)</h1>

<h2>Commandment 1</h2>

<p><strong>On Faith in God.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>  that there is one God who created and finished all things, and made all things out of nothing. He alone is able to contain the whole, but Himself cannot be contained.  Have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> therefore in Him, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him; and fearing Him, exercise self-control. Keep these commands, and you will cast away from you all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and put on the strength of righteousness, and live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you keep this commandment.</p>

<h2>Commandment 2</h2>

<p><strong>On Avoiding Evil-Speaking, and on Giving Alms in Simplicity.</strong></p>

<p>He said to me, <q>Be simple and guileless, and you will be as the children who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that ruins the life of men. First, then, speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of no one, nor listen with pleasure to any one who speaks <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another. But if you listen, you will partake of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of him who speaks <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> which you hear;  for believing it, you will also have something to say against your brother. Thus, then, will you be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of him who <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  and an unsteady <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. It never abides in peace, but always remains in discord. Keep yourself from it, and you will always be at peace with all. Put on a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in which there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of offense, but all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that are equable and joyful. Practise goodness; and from the rewards of your labours, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives you, give to all the needy in simplicity, not hesitating as to whom you are to give or not to give. Give to all, for God wishes His gifts to be shared among all. They who receive, will render an account to God why and for what they have received. For the afflicted who receive will not be condemned,  but they who receive on false pretences will suffer punishment. He, then, who gives is guiltless. For as he received from the Lord, so has he accomplished his service in simplicity, not hesitating as to whom he should give and to whom he should not give. This service, then, if accomplished in simplicity, is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He, therefore, who thus ministers in simplicity, will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Keep therefore these commandments, as I have given them to you, that your repentance and the repentance of your house may be found in simplicity, and your heart  may be pure and stainless.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 3</h2>

<p><strong>On Avoiding Falsehood, and on the Repentance of Hermas for His Dissimulation.</strong></p>

<p>Again he said to me, <q>Love the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and let nothing but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> proceed from your mouth,  that the spirit which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has placed in your flesh may be found truthful before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and the Lord, who dwells in you,  will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, because the Lord is truthful in every word, and in Him is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. They therefore who lie deny the Lord, and rob Him, not giving back to Him the deposit which they have received. For they received from Him a spirit free from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.  If they give him back this spirit untruthful, they pollute the commandment of the Lord, and become <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>.</q> On hearing these words, I wept most violently. When he saw me weeping, he said to me, <q>Why do you weep?</q> And I said, <q>Because, sir, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not if I can be saved.</q> <q>Why?</q> said he. And I said, <q>Because, sir, I never spoke a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> word in my life, but have ever spoken cunningly to all,  and have affirmed a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to all; and no one ever contradicted me, but credit was given to my word. How then can I live, since I have acted thus?</q> And he said to me, <q>Your feelings are indeed right and sound, for you ought as a servant of God to have walked in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not to have joined an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor to have caused sadness to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Spirit.</q>  And I said to him, <q>Never, sir, did I listen to these words with so much attention.</q> And he said to me, <q>Now you hear them, and keep them, that even the falsehoods which you formerly told in your transactions may come to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of your present statements. For even they can become worthy of credit. If you keep these precepts, and from this time forward you speak nothing but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  it will be possible for you to obtain life. And whosoever shall hear this commandment, and depart from that great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, shall live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 4</h2>

<p><strong>On Putting One's Wife Away for Adultery.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><q>I charge you,</q> said he, <q>to guard your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and let no thought enter your heart of another man's wife, or of fornication, or of similar iniquities; for by doing this you commit a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if you always remember your own wife, you will never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if this thought  enter your heart, then you will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and if, in like manner, you think other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts, you commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For this thought is great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one commit this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed, he works death for himself. Attend, therefore, and refrain from this thought; for where purity dwells, there iniquity ought not to enter the heart of a righteous man.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, permit me to ask you a few questions.</q>  <q>Say on,</q> said he. And I said to him, <q>Sir, if any one has a wife who trusts in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and if he detect her in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, does the man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he continue to live with her?</q> And he said to me, <q>As long as he remains <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the husband commits no transgression in living with her. But if the husband <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his wife has gone astray, and if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> does not repent, but persists in her fornication, and yet the husband continues to live with her, he also is guilty of her crime, and a sharer in her <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> And I said to him, <q>What then, sir, is the husband to do, if his wife continue in her vicious practices?</q> And he said, <q>The husband should put her away, and remain by himself. But if he put his wife away and marry another, he also commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q>  And I said to him, <q>What if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> put away should repent, and wish to return to her husband: shall she not be taken back by her husband?</q> And he said to me, <q>Assuredly. If the husband do not take her back, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and brings a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon himself; for he ought to take back the sinner who has repented. But not frequently.  For there is but one repentance to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In case, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> wife may repent, the husband ought not to marry another, when his wife has been put away. In this matter man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> are to be treated exactly in the same way. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is committed not only by those who pollute their flesh, but by those who imitate the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> in their actions.  Wherefore if any one  persists in such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and repents not, withdraw from him, and cease to live with him, otherwise you are a sharer in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore has the injunction been laid on you, that you should remain by yourselves, both man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for in such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> repentance can take place. But I do not,</q> said he, <q>give opportunity for the doing of these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but that he who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more. But with regard to his previous transgressions, there is One who is able to provide a cure;  for it is He, indeed, who has power over all.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>I asked him again, and said, <q>Since the Lord has vouchsafed to dwell always with me, bear with me while I utter a few words;  for I understand nothing, and my heart has been hardened by my previous mode of life. Give me understanding, for I am exceedingly dull, and I understand absolutely nothing.</q> And he answered and said unto me, <q>I am set over repentance, and I give understanding to all who repent. Do you not think,</q> he said, <q>that it is great wisdom to repent? For repentance is great wisdom.  For he who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> understands that he acted wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and remembers the actions he has done, and he repents, and no longer acts wickedly, but does good munificently, and humbles and torments his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> because he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. You see, therefore, that repentance is great wisdom.</q> And I said to him, <q>It is for this reason, sir, that I inquire carefully into all things, especially because I am a sinner; that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what works I should do, that I may live: for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are many and various.</q> And he said to me, <q>You shall live if you keep my commandments,  and walk in them; and whosoever shall hear and keep these commandments, shall live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>And I said to him, <q>I should like to continue my questions.</q> <q>Speak on,</q> said he. And I said, <q>I heard, sir, some teachers maintain that there is no other repentance than that which takes place, when we descended into the water  and received remission of our former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> He said to me, <q>That was sound doctrine which you heard; for that is really the case. For he who has received remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any more, but to live in purity. Since, however, you inquire diligently into all things, I will point this also out to you, not as giving occasion for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to those who are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or have lately <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, in the Lord. For those who have now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and those who are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, have not repentance for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but they have remission of their previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For to those who have been called before these days, the Lord has set repentance. For the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the heart, and foreknowing all things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the manifold wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that he would inflict some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and would act wickedly towards them.  The Lord, therefore, being merciful, has had mercy on the work of His hand, and has set repentance for them; and He has entrusted to me power over this repentance. And therefore I say to you, that if any one is tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after that great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> calling in which the Lord has called His people to everlasting life,  he has opportunity to repent but once. But if he should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> frequently after this, and then repent, to such a man his repentance will be of no avail; for with difficulty will he live.</q>  And I said, <q>Sir, I feel that life has come back to me in listening attentively to these commandments; for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I shall be saved, if in future I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more.</q> And he said, <q>You will be saved, you and all who keep these commandments.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>And again I asked him, saying, <q>Sir, since you have been so patient in listening to me, will you show me this also?</q> <q>Speak,</q> said he. And I said, <q>If a wife or husband die, and the widower or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> marry, does he or she commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in marrying again,</q> said he; <q>but if they remain unmarried, they gain greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the Lord; but if they marry, they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  Guard, therefore, your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and purity, and you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What commandments I now give you, and what I am to give, keep from henceforth, yea, from the very day when you were entrusted to me, and I will dwell in your house. And your former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will be forgiven, if you keep my commandments. And all shall be forgiven who keep these my commandments, and walk in this <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of Sadness of Heart, and of Patience.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><q>Be patient,</q> said he, <q>and of good understanding, and you will rule over every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> work, and you will work all righteousness. For if you be patient, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that dwells in you will be pure. He will not be darkened by any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, but, dwelling in a broad region,  he will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad; and with the vessel in which he dwells he will serve God in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, having great peace within himself.  But if any outburst of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> take place, immediately the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is tender, is straitened, not having a pure place, and He seeks to depart. For he is choked by the vile spirit, and cannot attend on the Lord as he wishes, for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> pollutes him. For the Lord dwells in long-suffering, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.  The two spirits, then, when dwelling in the same habitation, are at discord with each other, and are troublesome to that man in whom they dwell.  For if an exceedingly small piece of wormwood be taken and put into a jar of honey, is not the honey entirely destroyed, and does not the exceedingly small piece of wormwood entirely take away the sweetness of the honey, so that it no longer affords any gratification to its owner, but has become bitter, and lost its use? But if the wormwood be not put into the honey, then the honey remains sweet, and is of use to its owner. You see, then, that patience is sweeter than honey, and useful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Lord dwells in it. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is bitter and useless. Now, if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be mingled with patience, the patience is polluted,  and its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not then useful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>I should like, sir,</q> said I, <q>to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that I may guard myself against it.</q> And he said, <q>If you do not guard yourself against it, you and your house lose all hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Guard yourself, therefore, against it. For I am with you, and all will depart from it who repent with their whole heart.  For I will be with them, and I will save them all. For all are justified by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</q> </p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><q>Hear now,</q> said he, <q>how <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is the action of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and in what way it overthrows the servants of God by its action, and turns them from righteousness. But it does not turn away those who are full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor does it act on them, for the power of the Lord is with them. It is the thoughtless and doubting that it turns away.  For as soon as it sees such men standing steadfast, it throws itself into their hearts, and for nothing at all the man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> becomes embittered on account of occurrences in their daily life, as for instance on account of their food, or some superfluous word that has been uttered, or on account of some friend, or some gift or debt, or some such senseless affair. For all these things are foolish and empty and unprofitable to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But patience is great, and mighty, and strong, and calm in the midst of great enlargement, joyful, rejoicing, free from care, glorifying God at all times, having no bitterness in her, and abiding continually meek and quiet. Now this patience dwells with those who have complete <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is foolish, and fickle, and senseless. Now, of folly is begotten bitterness, and of bitterness <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> frenzy. This frenzy, the product of so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, ends in great and incurable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For when all these spirits dwell in one vessel in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also dwells, the vessel cannot contain them, but overflows. The tender Spirit, then, not being accustomed to dwell with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, nor with hardness, withdraws from such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and seeks to dwell with meekness and peacefulness. Then, when he withdraws from the man in whom he dwelt, the man is emptied of the righteous Spirit; and being henceforward filled with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>,  he is in a state of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> in every action, being dragged here and there by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and there is a complete darkness in his mind as to everything good. This, then, is what happens to all the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Wherefore do you depart from that most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and put on patience, and resist <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and bitterness, and you will be found in company with the purity which is loved by the Lord.  Take care, then, that you neglect not by any chance this commandment: for if you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> this commandment, you will be able to keep all the other commandments which I am to give you. Be strong, then, in these commandments, and put on power, and let all put on power, as many as wish to walk in them.</q> </p>

<h2>Commandment 6</h2>

<p><strong>How to Recognise the Two Spirits Attendant on Each Man, and How to Distinguish the Suggestions of the One from Those of the Other.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><q>I gave you,</q> he said, <q>directions in the first commandment to attend to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and self-restraint.</q> <q>Even so, sir,</q> said I. And he said, <q>Now I wish to show you the powers of these, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what power each possesses. For their powers are double, and have relation alike to the righteous and the unrighteous. Trust you, therefore, the righteous, but put no trust in the unrighteous. For the path of righteousness is straight, but that of unrighteousness is crooked. But walk in the straight and even way, and mind not the crooked. For the crooked path has no roads, but has many pathless places and stumbling-blocks in it, and it is rough and thorny. It is injurious to those who walk therein. But they who walk in the straight road walk evenly without stumbling, because it is neither rough nor thorny. You see, then, that it is better to walk in this road.</q> <q>I wish to go by this road,</q> said I. <q>You will go by it,</q> said he; <q>and whoever turns to the Lord with all his heart will walk in it.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><q>Hear now,</q> said he, <q>in regard to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. There are two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  with a man&mdash; one of righteousness, and the other of iniquity.</q> And I said to him, <q>How, sir, am I to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the powers of these, for both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> dwell with me?</q> <q>Hear,</q> said he, and <q>understand them. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness is gentle and modest, meek and peaceful. When, therefore, he ascends into your heart, immediately  he talks to you of righteousness, purity, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, contentment, and of every righteous deed and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. When all these ascend into your heart, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness is with you. These are the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness. Trust him, then, and his works. Look now at the works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of iniquity. First, he is wrathful, and bitter, and foolish, and his works are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and ruin the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When, then, he ascends into your heart, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him by his works.</q> And I said to him, <q>How, sir, I shall perceive him, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> <q>Hear and understand</q> said he. <q>When <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> comes upon you, or harshness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is in you; and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this to be the case also, when you are attacked by a longing after many transactions,  and the richest delicacies, and drunken revels, and various luxuries, and things improper, and by a hankering after <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and by overreaching, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and blustering, and by whatever is like to these. When these ascend into your heart, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of iniquity is in you. Now that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his works, depart from him, and in no respect trust him, because his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and unprofitable to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These, then, are the actions of both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Understand them, and trust the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness; but depart from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of iniquity, because his instruction is bad in every deed.  For though a man be most faithful,  and the thought of this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ascend into his heart, that man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> must <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, be a man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ever so bad, yet, if the works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness ascend into his or her heart, he or she must do something good. You see, therefore, that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to follow the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness, but to bid farewell  to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of iniquity.</q></p>

<p><q>This commandment exhibits the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that you may trust the works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness, and doing them you may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of iniquity are hard. If you refuse to do them, you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 7</h2>

<p><strong>On Fearing God, and Not Fearing the Devil.</strong></p>

<p><q>Fear,</q> said he, <q>the Lord, and keep His commandments. <span class="stiki" id="note020197"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse13">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:13</a></span> For if you keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you will be powerful in every action, and every one of your actions will be incomparable. For, fearing the Lord, you will do all things well. This is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which you ought to have, that you may be saved. But <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for, fearing the Lord, you will have dominion over the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, for there is no power in him. But he in whom there is no power ought on no account to be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but He in whom there is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> power is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be feared. For every one that has power ought to be feared; but he who has not power is despised by all. Fear, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, since they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For, fearing the Lord, you will not do these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but will refrain from them. For fears are of two kinds:  for if you do not wish to do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, and you will not do it; but, again, if you wish to do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, and you will do it. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is strong, and great, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. Fear, then, the Lord, and you will live to Him, and as many as <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him and keep His commandments will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Why,</q>  said I, <q>sir, did you say in regard to those that keep His commandments, that they will live to God?</q> <q>Because,</q> says he, <q>all creation fears the Lord, but all creation does not keep His commandments. They only who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord and keep His commandments have life with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  but as to those who keep not His commandments, there is no life in them.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 8</h2>

<p><strong>We Ought to Shun that Which is Evil, and Do that Which is Good.</strong></p>

<p><q>I told you,</q> said he, <q>that the creatures of God are double,  for restraint also is double; for in some cases restraint has to be exercised, in others there is no need of restraint.</q> <q>Make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, sir,</q> say I, <q>in what cases restraint has to be exercised, and in what cases it has not.</q> <q>Restrain yourself in regard to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do it not; but exercise no restraint in regard to good, but do it. For if you exercise restraint in the doing of good, you will commit a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;  but if you exercise restraint, so as not to do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you are practising great righteousness. Restrain yourself, therefore, from all iniquity, and do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <q>What, sir,</q> say I, <q>are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> from which we must restrain ourselves?</q> <q>Hear,</q> says he: <q>from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication, from unlawful revelling,  from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> luxury, from indulgence in many kinds of food and the extravagance of riches, and from boastfulness, and haughtiness, and insolence, and lies, and backbiting, and hypocrisy, from the remembrance of wrong, and from all <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>. These are the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that are most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the life of men. From all these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, therefore, the servant of God must restrain himself. For he who does not restrain himself from these, cannot live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Listen, then, to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that accompany these.</q> <q>Are there, sir,</q> said I, <q>any other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>?</q> <q>There are,</q> says he; <q>and many of them, too, from which the servant of God must restrain himself&mdash; theft, lying, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, overreaching, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, deceit, vainglory, boastfulness, and all other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> like to these.</q> <q>Do you not think that these are really <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>?</q> <q>Exceedingly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From all of these the servant of God must restrain himself. Restrain yourself, then, from all these, that you may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you will be enrolled among those who restrain themselves in regard to these matters. These, then, are the things from which you must restrain yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>But listen,</q> says he, <q>to the things in regard to which you have not to exercise self-restraint, but which you ought to do. Restrain not yourself in regard to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but do it.</q> <q>And tell me, sir,</q> say I, <q>the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that I may walk in them and wait on them, so that doing them I can be saved.</q> <q>Listen,</q> says he, <q>to the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which you ought to do, and in regard to which there is no self-restraint requisite. First of all  there is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, concord, words of righteousness, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, patience. Than these, nothing is better in the life of men. If any one attend to these, and restrain himself not from them, blessed is he in his life. Then there are the following attendant on these: helping <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, looking after <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and the needy, rescuing the servants of God from necessities, the being hospitable&mdash; for in hospitality good-doing finds a field&mdash; never opposing any one, the being quiet, having fewer needs than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, reverencing the aged, practising righteousness, watching the brotherhood, bearing insolence, being long-suffering, encouraging those who are sick in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not casting those who have fallen into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but turning them back and restoring them to peace of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, admonishing sinners, not oppressing debtors and the needy, and if there are any other actions like these.  Do these seem to you good?</q> says he. <q>For what, sir,</q> say I, <q>is better than these?</q> <q>Walk then in them,</q> says he, <q>and restrain not yourself from them, and you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Keep, therefore, this commandment. If you do good, and restrain not yourself from it, you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All who act thus will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, again, if you refuse to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and restrain yourself from it, you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And all will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who keep these commandments, and walk in them.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 9</h2>

<p><strong>Prayer Must Be Made to God Without Ceasing, and with Unwavering Confidence.</strong></p>

<p>He says to me, <q>Put away doubting from you and do not hesitate to ask of the Lord, saying to yourself, 'How can I ask of the Lord and receive from Him, seeing I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> so much against Him? 'Do not thus reason with yourself, but with all your heart turn to the Lord and ask of Him without doubting, and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the multitude of His tender mercies; that He will never leave you, but fulfil the request of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For He is not like men, who remember <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> done against them; but He Himself remembers not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and has compassion on His own creature. Cleanse, therefore, your heart from all the vanities of this world, and from the words already mentioned, and ask of the Lord and you will receive all, and in none of your requests will you be denied which you make to the Lord without doubting. But if you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in your heart, you will receive none of your requests. For those who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> regarding God are double-souled, and obtain not one of their requests.  But those who are perfect in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ask everything, trusting in the Lord; and they obtain, because they ask nothing doubting, and not being double-souled. For every double-souled man, even if he repent, will with difficulty be saved.  Cleanse your heart, therefore, from all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and put on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because it is strong, and trust God that you will obtain from Him all that you ask. And if at any time, after you have asked of the Lord, you are slower in obtaining your request [than you expected], do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> because you have not soon obtained the request of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for invariably it is on account of some <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> or some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that you are slower in obtaining your request. Wherefore do not cease to make the request of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and you will obtain it. But if you grow weary and waver in your request, blame yourself, and not Him who does not give to you. Consider this doubting state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and senseless, and turns many away entirely from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even though they be very strong. For this doubting is the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and acts exceedingly wickedly to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Despise, then, doubting, and gain the mastery over it in everything; clothing yourself with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is strong and powerful. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> promises all things, perfects all things; but <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> having no thorough <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in itself, fails in every work which it undertakes. You see, then,</q> says he, <q>that, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is from above&mdash; from the Lord &mdash; and has great power; but <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is an earthly spirit, coming from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and has no power. Serve, then, that which has power, namely <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and keep away from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, which has no power, and you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And all will live to God whose minds have been set on these things.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 10</h2>

<p><strong>Of Grief, and Not Grieving the Spirit of God Which is in Us.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><q>Remove from you,</q> says he, <q>grief; for she is the sister of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <q>How, sir,</q> say I, <q>is she the sister of these? For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and grief seem to be quite different from each other.</q> <q>You are senseless, O man. Do you not perceive that grief is more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than all the spirits, and most terrible to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and more than all other spirits destroys man and crushes out the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and yet, on the other hand, she saves him?</q> <q>I am senseless, sir,</q> say I, <q>and do not understand these <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. For how she can crush out, and on the other hand save, I do not perceive.</q> <q>Listen,</q> says he. <q>Those who have never searched for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor investigated the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Divinity, but have simply <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, when they devote themselves to and become mixed up with business, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> friendships, and many other actions of this world,  do not perceive the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of Divinity; for their minds are darkened by these actions, and they are corrupted and become dried up. Even as beautiful vines, when they are neglected, are withered up by thorns and various plants, so men who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and have afterwards fallen away into many of those actions above mentioned, go astray in their minds, and lose all understanding in regard to righteousness; for if they hear of righteousness, their minds are occupied with their business,  and they give no heed at all. Those, on the other hand, who have the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and search after Godhead and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and have their hearts turned to the Lord, quickly perceive and understand what is said to them, because they have the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord in them. For where the Lord dwells, there is much understanding. Cleave, then, to the Lord, and you will understand and perceive all things.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><q>Hear, then,</q> says he, <q>foolish man, how grief crushes out the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and on the other hand saves. When the doubting man attempts any deed, and fails in it on account of his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, this grief enters into the man, and grieves the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and crushes him out. Then, on the other hand, when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> attaches itself to a man in regard to any matter, and he is embittered, then grief enters into the heart of the man who was irritated, and he is grieved at the deed which he did, and repents that he has wrought a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed. This grief, then, appears to be accompanied by <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because the man, after having done a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed, repented.  Both actions grieve the Spirit: <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, because it did not accomplish its object; and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grieves the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because it did what was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Both these are grievous to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Wherefore remove grief from you, and crush not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which dwells in you, lest he entreat God  against you, and he withdraw from you. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> which has been granted to us to dwell in this body does not endure grief nor straitness. Wherefore put on cheerfulness, which always is agreeable and acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it. For every cheerful man does what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and minds what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and despises grief;  but the sorrowful man always acts wickedly. First, he acts wickedly because he grieves the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which was given to man a cheerful Spirit. Secondly, Grieving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,  he works iniquity, neither entreating the Lord nor confessing  to Him. For the entreaty of the sorrowful man has no power to ascend to the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Why,</q> say I, <q>does not the entreaty of the grieved man ascend to the altar?</q> <q>Because,</q> says he, <q>grief sits in his heart. Grief, then, mingled with his entreaty, does not permit the entreaty to ascend pure to the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as vinegar and wine, when mixed in the same vessel, do not give the same pleasure [as wine alone gives], so grief mixed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> does not produce the same entreaty [as would be produced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> alone]. Cleanse yourself from this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> grief, and you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and all will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who drive away grief from them, and put on all cheerfulness.</q> </p>

<h2>Commandment 11</h2>

<p><strong>The Spirit and Prophets to Be Tried by Their Works; Also of the Two Kinds of Spirit.</strong></p>

<p>He pointed out to me some men sitting on a seat, and one man sitting on a chair. And he says to me, <q>Do you see the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sitting on the seat?</q> <q>I do, sir,</q> said I. <q>These,</q> says he, <q>are the faithful, and he who sits on the chair is a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>, ruining the minds of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  It is the doubters, not the faithful, that he ruins. These doubters then go to him as to a soothsayer, and inquire of him what will happen to them; and he, the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>, not having the power of a Divine Spirit in him, answers them according to their inquiries, and according to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires, and fills their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with expectations, according to their own wishes. For being himself empty, he gives empty answers to empty inquirers; for every answer is made to the emptiness of man. Some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> words he does occasionally utter; for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> fills him with his own spirit, in the hope that he may be able to overcome some of the righteous. As many, then, as are strong in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, and are clothed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have no connection with such spirits, but keep away from them; but as many as are of doubtful minds and frequently repent, betake themselves to soothsaying, even as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and bring greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon themselves by their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For he who inquires of a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> in regard to any action is an idolater, and devoid of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and foolish. For no spirit given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires to be asked; but such a spirit having the power of Divinity speaks all things of itself, for it proceeds from above from the power of the Divine Spirit. But the spirit which is asked and speaks according to the desires of men is earthly,  light, and powerless, and it is altogether silent if it is not questioned.</q> <q>How then, sir,</q> say I, <q>will a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which of them is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>?</q> <q>I will tell you,</q> says he, <q>about both the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and then you can try the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> according to my directions. Try the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. First, he who has the Divine Spirit proceeding from above is meek, and peaceable, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and refrains from all iniquity and the vain desire of this world, and contents himself with fewer wants than those of other men, and when asked he makes no reply; nor does he speak privately, nor when man wishes the spirit to speak does the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> speak, but it speaks only when God wishes it to speak. When, then, a man having the Divine Spirit comes into an assembly of righteous men who have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Divine Spirit, and this assembly of men offers up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the prophetic Spirit,  who is destined for him, fills the man; and the man being filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, speaks to the multitude as the Lord wishes. Thus, then, will the Spirit of Divinity become manifest. Whatever power therefore comes from the Spirit of Divinity belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Hear, then,</q> says he, <q>in regard to the spirit which is earthly, and empty, and powerless, and foolish. First, the man  who seems to have the Spirit exalts himself, and wishes to have the first seat, and is bold, and impudent, and talkative, and lives in the midst of many luxuries and many other delusions, and takes rewards for his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and if he does not receive rewards, he does not prophesy. Can, then, the Divine Spirit take rewards and prophesy? It is not possible that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of God should do this, but <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of this character are possessed by an earthly spirit. Then it never approaches an assembly of righteous men, but shuns them. And it associates with doubters and the vain, and prophesies to them in a corner, and deceives them, speaking to them, according to their desires, mere empty words: for they are empty to whom it gives its answers. For the empty vessel, when placed along with the empty, is not crushed, but they correspond to each other. When, therefore, it comes into an assembly of righteous men who have a Spirit of Divinity, and they offer up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that man is made empty, and the earthly spirit tees from him through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and that man is made dumb, and is entirely crushed, being unable to speak. For if you pack closely a storehouse with wine or oil, and put an empty jar in the midst of the vessels of wine or oil, you will find that jar empty as when you placed it, if you should wish to clear the storehouse. So also the empty <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when they come to the spirits of the righteous, are found [on leaving] to be such as they were when they came. This, then, is the mode of life of both <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Try by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and his life the man who says that he is inspired. But as for you, trust the Spirit which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has power; but the spirit which is earthly and empty trust not at all, for there is no power in it: it comes from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Hear, then, the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which I am to tell you. Take a stone, and throw it to the sky, and see if you can touch it. Or again, take a squirt of water and squirt into the sky, and see if you can penetrate the sky.</q> <q>How, sir,</q> say I, <q>can these things take place? For both of them are impossible.</q> <q>As these things,</q> says he, <q>are impossible, so also are the earthly spirits powerless and pithless. But look, on the other hand, at the power which comes from above. Hail is of the size of a very small grain, yet when it falls on a man's head how much annoyance it gives him! Or, again, take the drop which falls from a pitcher to the ground, and yet it hollows a stone.  You see, then, that the smallest things coming from above have great power when they fall upon the earth.  Thus also is the Divine Spirit, which comes from above, powerful. Trust, then, that Spirit, but have nothing to do with the other.</q></p>

<h2>Commandment 12</h2>

<p><strong>On the Twofold Desire. The Commandments of God Can Be Kept, and Believers Ought Not to Fear the Devil.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>He says to me, <q>Put away from you all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire, and clothe yourself with good and chaste desire; for clothed with this desire you will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire,  and will rein yourself in even as you wish. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire is wild, and is with difficulty tamed. For it is terrible, and consumes men exceedingly by its wildness. Especially is the servant of God terribly consumed by it, if he falls into it and is devoid of understanding. Moreover, it consumes all such as have not on them the garment of good desire, but are entangled and mixed up with this world. These it delivers up to death.</q> <q>What then, sir,</q> say I, <q>are the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire which deliver men over to death? Make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, and I will refrain from them.</q> <q>Listen, then, to the works in which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire slays the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><q>Foremost of all is the desire after another's wife or husband, and after extravagance, and many useless dainties and drinks, and many other foolish luxuries; for all luxury is foolish and empty in the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These, then, are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires which slay the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire is the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. You must refrain from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, that by refraining you may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But as many as are mastered by them, and do not resist them, will perish at last, for these desires are fatal. Put you on, then, the desire of righteousness; and arming yourself with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, resist them. For the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord dwells in good desire. But if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire see you armed with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and resisting it, it will flee far from you, and it will no longer appear to you, for it fears your armour. Go, then, garlanded with the crown which you have gained for victory over it, to the desire of righteousness, and, delivering up to it the prize which you have received, serve it even as it wishes.  If you serve good desire, and be subject to it, you will gain the mastery over <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, and make it subject to you even as you wish.</q> </p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p><q>I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> say I, <q>in what way I ought to serve good desire.</q> <q>Hear,</q> says he: <q>You will practice righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and meekness, and whatsoever excellences are like to these. Practising these, you will be a well-pleasing servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and you will live to Him; and every one who shall serve good desire, shall live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>He concluded the twelve commandments, and said to me, <q>You have now these commandments. Walk in them, and exhort your hearers that their repentance may be pure during the remainder of their life. Fulfil carefully this ministry which I now entrust to you, and you will accomplish much.  For you will find favour among those who are to repent, and they will give heed to your words; for I will be with you, and will compel them to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you.</q> I say to him, <q>Sir, these commandments are great, and good, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and fitted to gladden the heart of the man who can perform them. But I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if these commandments can be kept by man, because they are exceeding hard.</q> He answered and said to me, <q>If you lay it down as certain that they can be kept,  then you will easily keep them, and they will not be hard. But if you come to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they cannot be kept by man, then you will not keep them. Now I say to you, If you do not keep them, but neglect them, you will not be saved, nor your children, nor your house, since you have already determined for yourself that these commandments cannot be kept by man.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>These things he said to me in tones of the deepest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so that I was confounded and exceedingly afraid of him, for his figure was altered so that a man could not endure his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But seeing me altogether agitated and confused, he began to speak to me in more gentle tones; and he said: <q>O fool, senseless and doubting, do you not perceive how great is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how strong and marvellous, in that He created the world for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  and subjected all creation to him, and gave him power to rule over everything under heaven? If, then, man is lord of the creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rules over all, is he not able to be lord also of these commandments? For,</q> says he, <q>the man who has the Lord in his heart can also be lord of all, and of every one of these commandments. But to those who have the Lord only on their lips, <span class="stiki" id="note020235"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a>; <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;15:8</a></span> but their hearts hardened, <span class="stiki" id="note020236"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;12:40</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:14</a></span> and who are far from the Lord, the commandments are hard and difficult. Put, therefore, you who are empty and fickle in your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the Lord in your heart, and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is nothing easier or sweeter, or more manageable, than these commandments. Return, you who walk in the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in hard, and bitter, and wild licentiousness, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for there is no power in him against you, for I will be with you, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, who am lord over him. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> only, but his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has no strength.  Fear him not, then, and he will flee from you.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>I say to him, <q>Sir, listen to me for a moment.</q> <q>Say what you wish,</q> says he. <q>Man, sir,</q> say I, <q>is eager to keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no one who does not ask of the Lord that strength may be given him for these commandments, and that he may be subject to them; but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is hard, and holds sway over them.</q> <q>He cannot,</q> says he, <q>hold sway over the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who with all their heart place their hopes in Him. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can wrestle against these, overthrow them he cannot. If, then, you resist him, he will be conquered, and flee in disgrace from you. As many, therefore,</q> says he, <q>as are empty, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as possessing power. When a man has filled very suitable jars with good wine, and a few among those jars are left empty,  then he comes to the jars, and does not look at the full jars, for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that they are full; but he looks at the empty, being afraid lest they have become sour. For empty jars quickly become sour, and the goodness of the wine is gone. So also the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> goes to all the servants of God to try them. As many, then, as are full in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, resist him strongly, and he withdraws from them, having no way by which he might enter them. He goes, then, to the empty, and finding a way of entrance, into them, he produces in them whatever he wishes, and they become his servants.</q> </p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p><q>But I, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, say to you Fear not the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for I was sent,</q> says he, <q>to be with you who repent with all your heart, and to make you strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Trust <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  then, you who on account of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have despaired of life, and who add to your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and weigh down your life; for if you return to the Lord with all your heart, and practice righteousness the rest of your days,  and serve Him according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, He will heal your former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you will have power to hold sway over the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But as to the threats of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not at all, for he is powerless as the sinews of a dead man. Give ear to me, then, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who has all power, both to save and destroy, <span class="stiki" id="note020242"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;12:5</a></span> and keep His commandments, and you will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> I say to him, <q>Sir, I am now made strong in all the ordinances of the Lord, because you are with me; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you will crush all the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and we shall have rule over him, and shall prevail against all his works. And I hope, sir, to be able to keep all these commandments  which you have enjoined upon me, the Lord strengthening me.</q> <q>You will keep them,</q> says he, <q>if your heart be pure towards the Lord; and all will keep them who cleanse their hearts from the vain desires of this world, and they will live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
