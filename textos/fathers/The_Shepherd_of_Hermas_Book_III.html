<h1>The Shepherd of Hermas (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Similitude 1</h2>

<p><strong>As in This World We Have No Abiding City, We Ought to Seek One to Come.</strong></p>

<p>He says to me, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you who are the servants of God dwell in a strange land; for your city is far away from this one.  If, then,</q> he continues, <q>you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your city in which you are to dwell, why do you here provide lands, and make expensive preparations, and accumulate dwellings and useless buildings? He who makes such preparations for this city cannot return again to his own. Oh foolish, and unstable, and miserable man! Do you not understand that all these things belong to another, and are under the power of another? For the lord of this city will say, 'I do not wish you to dwell in my city; but depart from this city, because you obey not my <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.' You, therefore, although having fields and houses, and many other things, when cast out by him, what will you do with your land, and house, and other possessions which you have gathered to yourself? For the lord of this country <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> says to you, 'Either <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> my <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or depart from my dominion.' What, then, do you intend to do, having a law in your own city, on account of your lands, and the rest of your possessions?  You shall altogether deny your law, and walk according to the law of this city. See lest it be to your hurt to deny your law;  for if you shall desire to return to your city, you will not be received, because you have denied the law of your city, but will be excluded from it. Have a care, therefore: as one living in a foreign land, make no further preparations for yourself than such merely as may be sufficient; and be ready, when the master of this city shall come to cast you out for disobeying his law, to leave his city, and to depart to your own, and to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your own law without being exposed to annoyance, but in great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Have a care, then, you who serve the Lord, and have Him in your heart, that you work the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, remembering His commandments and promises which He promised, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He will bring them to pass if His commandments be observed. Instead of lands, therefore, buy afflicted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, according as each one is able, and visit  <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and do not overlook them; and spend your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and all your preparations, which you received from the Lord, upon such lands and houses. For to this end did the Master make you rich, that you might perform these services unto Him; and it is much better to purchase such lands, and possessions, and houses, as you will find in your own city, when you come to reside in it. This is a noble and sacred expenditure, attended neither with sorrow nor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Do not practice the expenditure of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  for it is injurious to you who are the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but practice an expenditure of your own, in which you can <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; and do not corrupt  nor touch what is another's nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> it, for it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the goods of other men; but work your own work, and you will be saved.</q></p>

<h2>Similitude 2</h2>

<p><strong>As the Vine is Supported by the Elm, So is the Rich Man Helped by the Prayer of the Poor.</strong></p>
<p>As I was walking in the field, and observing an elm and vine, and determining in my own mind respecting them and their fruits, the Shepherd appears to me, and says, <q>What is it that you are thinking about the elm and vine?</q> <q>I am considering,</q> I reply, <q>that they become each other exceedingly well.</q> <q>These two trees,</q> he continues, <q>are intended as an example for the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>I would like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> said I, <q>the example which these trees you say, are intended to teach.</q> <q>Do you see,</q> he says, <q>the elm and the vine?</q> <q>I see them sir,</q> I replied. <q>This vine,</q> he continued, <q>produces fruit, and the elm is an unfruitful tree; but unless the vine be trained upon the elm, it cannot bear much fruit when extended at length upon the ground;  and the fruit which it does bear is rotten, because the plant is not suspended upon the elm. When, therefore, the vine is cast upon the elm, it yields fruit both from itself and from the elm. You see, moreover, that the elm also produces much fruit, not less than the vine, but even more; because,</q>  he continued, <q>the vine, when suspended upon the elm, yields much fruit, and good; but when thrown upon the ground, what it produces is small and rotten. This similitude,  therefore, is for the servants of God&mdash; for the poor man and for the rich.</q> <q>How so, sir?</q> said I; <q>explain the matter to me.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>The rich man has much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but is poor in matters relating to the Lord, because he is distracted about his riches; and he offers very few confessions and intercessions to the Lord, and those which he does offer are small and weak, and have no power above. But when the rich man refreshes  the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and assists him in his necessities, believing that what he does to the poor man will be able to find its reward with God&mdash; because the poor man is rich in intercession and confession, and his intercession has great power with God&mdash; then the rich man helps the poor in all things without hesitation; and the poor man, being helped by the rich, intercedes for him, giving thanks to God for him who bestows gifts upon him. And he still continues to interest himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the poor man, that his wants may be constantly supplied. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the intercession of the poor man is acceptable and influential  with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both, accordingly, accomplish their work. The poor man makes intercession; a work in which he is rich, which he received from the Lord, and with which he recompenses the master who helps him. And the rich man, in like manner, unhesitatingly bestows upon the poor man the riches which he received from the Lord. And this is a great work, and acceptable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he understands the object of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and has given to the poor of the gifts of the Lord, and rightly discharged his service to Him.  Among men, however, the elm appears not to produce fruit, and they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor understand that if a drought come, the elm, which contains water, nourishes the vine; and the vine, having an unfailing supply of water, yields double fruit both for itself and for the elm. So also poor men interceding with the Lord on behalf of the rich, increase their riches; and the rich, again, aiding the poor in their necessities, satisfy their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Both, therefore, are partners in the righteous work. He who does these things shall not be deserted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but shall be enrolled in the books of the living. Blessed are they who have riches, and who understand that they are from the Lord. [For they who are of that mind will be able to do some good. ]</q></p>

<h2>Similitude 3</h2>

<p><strong>As in Winter Green Trees Cannot Be Distinguished from Withered, So in This World Neither Can the Just from the Unjust.</strong></p>

<p>He showed me many trees having no leaves, but withered, as it seemed to me; for all were alike. And he said to me, <q>Do you see those trees?</q> <q>I see, sir,</q> I replied, <q>that all are alike, and withered.</q> He answered me, and said, <q>These trees which you see are those who dwell in this world.</q> <q>Why, then, sir,</q> I said, <q>are they withered, as it were, and alike?</q>  <q>Because,</q> he said, <q>neither are the righteous manifest in this life, nor sinners, but they are alike; for this life is a winter to the righteous, and they do not manifest themselves, because they dwell with sinners: for as in winter trees that have cast their leaves are alike, and it is not seen which are dead and which are living, so in this world neither do the righteous show themselves, nor sinners, but all are alike one to another.</q> </p>

<h2>Similitude 4</h2>

<p><strong>As in Summer Living Trees are Distinguished from Withered by Fruit and Living Leaves, So in the World to Come the Just Differ from the Unjust in Happiness.</strong></p>

<p>He showed me again many trees, some budding, and others withered. And he said to me, <q>Do you see these trees?</q> <q>I see, sir,</q> I replied, <q>some putting forth buds, and others withered.</q> <q>Those,</q> he said, <q>which are budding are the righteous who are to live in the world to come; for the coming world is the summer  of the righteous, but the winter of sinners. When, therefore, the mercy of the Lord shines forth, then shall they be made manifest who are the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall be made manifest. For as in summer the fruits of each individual tree appear, and it is ascertained of what sort they are, so also the fruits of the righteous shall be manifest, and all who have been fruitful in that world shall be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.  But the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and sinners, like the withered trees which you saw, will be found to be those who have been withered and unfruitful in that world, and shall be burnt as wood, and [so] made manifest, because their actions were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> during their lives. For the sinners shall be consumed because they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and did not repent, and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> shall be burned because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not Him who created them. Do you therefore bear fruit, that in that summer your fruit may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And refrain from much business, and you will never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for they who are occupied with much business commit also many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being distracted about their affairs, and not at all serving their Lord.  How, then,</q> he continued, <q>can such a one ask and obtain anything from the Lord, if he serve Him not? They who serve Him shall obtain their requests, but they who serve Him not shall receive nothing. And in the performance even of a single action a man can serve the Lord; for his mind will not be perverted from the Lord, but he will serve Him, having a pure mind. If, therefore, you do these things, you shall be able to bear fruit for the life to come. And every one who will do these things shall bear fruit.</q></p>

<h2>Similitude 5</h2>

<p><strong>Of True Fasting and Its Reward: Also of Purity of Body.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and sitting on a certain mountain, and giving thanks to the Lord for all His dealings with me, I see the Shepherd sitting down beside me, and saying, <q>Why have you come hither [so] early in the morning?</q> <q>Because, sir,</q> I answered, <q>I have a station.</q>  <q>What is a station?</q> he asked. <q>I am <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, sir,</q> I replied. <q>What is this <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>,</q> he continued, <q>which you are observing?</q> <q>As I have been accustomed, sir,</q> I reply, <q>so I fast.</q> <q>You do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he says, <q>how to fast unto the Lord: this useless <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> which you observe to Him is of no value.</q> <q>Why, sir,</q> I answered, <q>do you say this?</q> <q>I say to you,</q> he continued, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> which you think you observe is not a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. But I will teach you what is a full and acceptable <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Listen,</q> he continued: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not desire such an empty <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.  For <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this way you will do nothing for a righteous life; but offer to God a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of the following kind: Do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your life, and serve the Lord with a pure heart: keep His commandments, walking in His precepts, and let no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire arise in your heart; and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If you do these things, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, and abstain from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, you will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if you do these things, you will keep a great fast, and one acceptable before God.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><q>Hear the similitude which I am about to narrate to you relative to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. A certain man had a field and many slaves, and he planted a certain part of the field with a vineyard,  and selecting a faithful and beloved and much valued slave, he called him to him, and said, 'Take this vineyard which I have planted, and stake  it until I come, and do nothing else to the vineyard; and attend to this order of mine, and you shall receive your freedom from me.' And the master of the slave departed to a foreign country. And when he had gone, the slave took and staked the vineyard; and when he had finished the staking of the vines, he saw that the vineyard was full of weeds. He then reflected, saying, 'I have kept this order of my master: I will dig up the rest of this vineyard, and it will be more beautiful when dug up; and being free of weeds, it will yield more fruit, not being choked by them.' He took, therefore, and dug up the vineyard, and rooted out all the weeds that were in it. And that vineyard became very beautiful and fruitful, having no weeds to choke it. And after a certain time the master of the slave and of the field returned, and entered into the vineyard. And seeing that the vines were suitably supported on stakes, and the ground, moreover, dug up, and all the weeds rooted out, and the vines fruitful, he was greatly pleased with the work of his slave. And calling his beloved son who was his heir, and his friends who were his councillors, he told them what orders he had given his slave, and what he had found performed. And they rejoiced along with the slave at the testimony which his master bore to him. And he said to them, 'I promised this slave freedom if he <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the command which I gave him; and he has kept my command, and done besides a good work to the vineyard, and has pleased me exceedingly. In return, therefore, for the work which he has done, I wish to make him co-heir with my son, because, having good thoughts, he did not neglect them, but carried them out.' With this resolution of the master his son and friends were well pleased, viz., that the slave should be co-heir with the son. After a few days the master made a feast,  and sent to his slave many dishes from his table. And the slave receiving the dishes that were sent him from his master, took of them what was sufficient for himself, and distributed the rest among his fellow-slaves. And his fellow-slaves rejoiced to receive the dishes, and began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, that he might find still greater favour with his master for having so treated them. His master heard all these things that were done, and was again greatly pleased with his conduct. And the master again calling together his friends and his son, reported to them the slave's proceeding with regard to the dishes which he had sent him. And they were still more satisfied that the slave should become co-heir with his son.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>I said to him, <q>Sir, I do not see the meaning of these similitudes, nor am I able to comprehend them, unless you explain them to me.</q> <q>I will explain them all to you,</q> he said, <q>and whatever I shall mention in the course of our conversations I will show you. [Keep the commandments of the Lord, and you will be approved, and inscribed among the number of those who observe His commands.] And if you do any good beyond what is commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  you will gain for yourself more abundant <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and will be more honoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than you would otherwise be. If, therefore, in keeping the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you do, in addition, these services, you will have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> if you observe them according to my command.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, whatsoever you enjoin upon me I will observe, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are with me.</q> <q>I will be with you,</q> he replied, <q>because you have such a desire for doing good; and I will be with all those,</q> he added, <q>who have such a desire. This <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>,</q> he continued, <q>is very good, provided the commandments of the Lord be observed. Thus, then, shall you observe the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> which you intend to keep.  First of all,  be on your guard against every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word, and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, and purify your heart from all the vanities of this world. If you guard against these things, your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> will be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. And you will do also as follows.  Having fulfilled what is written, in the day on which you fast you will taste nothing but bread and water; and having reckoned up the price of the dishes of that day which you intended to have eaten, you will give it to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or an orphan, or to some person in want, and thus you will exhibit humility of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that he who has received benefit from your humility may fill his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. If you observe <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, as I have commanded you, your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> will be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> will be written down; and the service thus performed is noble, and sacred, and acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. These things, therefore, shall you thus observe with your children, and all your house, and in observing them you will be blessed; and as many as hear these words and observe them shall be blessed; and whatsoever they ask of the Lord they shall receive.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> him much that he would explain to me the similitude of the field, and of the master of the vineyard, and of the slave who staked the vineyard, and of the sakes, and of the weeds that were plucked out of the vineyard, and of the son, and of the friends who were fellow-councillors, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that all these things were a kind of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>. And he answered me, and said, <q>You are exceedingly persistent  with your questions. You ought not,</q> he continued, <q>to ask any questions at all; for if it is needful to explain anything, it will be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, whatsoever you show me, and do not explain, I shall have seen to no purpose, not understanding its meaning. In like manner, also, if you speak <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> to me, and do not unfold them, I shall have heard your words in vain.</q> And he answered me again, saying, <q>Every one who is the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has his Lord in his heart, asks of Him understanding, and receives it, and opens up every <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>; and the words of the Lord become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him which are spoken in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>.  But those who are weak and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, hesitate to ask anything from the Lord; but the Lord is full of compassion, and gives without fail to all who ask Him. But you, having been strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angel,  and having obtained from Him such intercession, and not being <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, why do not you ask of the Lord understanding, and receive it from Him?</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, having you with me, I am necessitated to ask questions of you, for you show me all things, and converse with me; but if I were to see or hear these things without you, I would then ask the Lord to explain them.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p><q>I said to you a little ago,</q> he answered, <q>that you were cunning and obstinate in asking explanations of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>; but since you are so persistent, I shall unfold to you the meaning of the similitudes of the field, and of all the others that follow, that you may make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every one.  Hear now,</q> he said, <q>and understand them. The field is this world; and the Lord of the field is He who created, and perfected, and strengthened all things; [and the son is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; ] and the slave is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and the vines are this people, whom He Himself planted; and the stakes are the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the Lord, who keep His people together; and the weeds that were plucked out of the vineyard are the iniquities of God's servants; and the dishes which He sent Him from His table are the commandments which He gave His people through His Son; and the friends and fellow-councillors are the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were first created; and the Master's absence from home is the time that remains until His appearing.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, all these are great, and marvellous, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things. Could I, therefore,</q> I continued, <q>understand them? No, nor could any other man, even if exceedingly wise. Moreover,</q> I added, <q>explain to me what I am about to ask you.</q> <q>Say what you wish,</q> he replied. <q>Why, sir,</q> I asked, <q>is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> in the form of a slave?</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p><q>Hear,</q> he answered: <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not in the form  of a slave, but in great power and might.</q> <q>How so, sir?</q> I said; <q>I do not understand.</q> <q>Because,</q> he answered, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> planted the vineyard, that is to say, He created the people, and gave them to His Son; and the Son appointed His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over them to keep them; and He Himself purged away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, having suffered many trials and undergone many labours, for no one is able to dig without labour and toil. He Himself, then, having purged away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people, showed them the paths of life  by giving them the law which He received from His Father. [You see,</q> he said, <q>that He is the Lord of the people, having received all authority from His Father. ] And why the Lord took His Son as councillor, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, regarding the heirship of the slave, listen. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, pre-existent Spirit, that created every creature, God made to dwell in flesh, which He chose.  This flesh, accordingly, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dwelt, was nobly subject to that Spirit, walking religiously and chastely, in no respect defiling the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and accordingly, after living  excellently and purely, and after labouring and co-operating with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and having in everything acted vigorously and courageously along with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He assumed it as a partner with it. For this conduct  of the flesh pleased Him, because it was not defiled on the earth while having the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. He took, therefore, as fellow-councillors His Son and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in order that this flesh, which had been subject to the body without a fault, might have some place of tabernacle, and that it might not appear that the reward [of its servitude had been lost ], for the flesh that has been found without spot or defilement, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dwelt, [will receive a reward ]. You have now the explanation  of this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p><q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, sir,</q> I said, <q>to hear this explanation.</q> <q>Hear,</q> again he replied: <q>Keep this flesh pure and stainless, that the Spirit which inhabits it may bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it, and your flesh may be justified. See that the thought never arise in your mind that this flesh of yours is corruptible, and you misuse it by any act of defilement. If you defile your flesh, you will also defile the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and if you defile your flesh [and spirit], you will not live.</q>  <q>And if any one, sir,</q> I said, <q>has been hitherto <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, before he heard these words, how can such a man be saved who has defiled his flesh?</q> <q>Respecting former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>  of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>,</q> he said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is able to heal them, for to Him belongs all power. [But be on your guard now, and the all-powerful and compassionate God will heal former transgressions ], if for the time to come you defile not your body nor your spirit; for both are common, and cannot be defiled, the one without the other: keep both therefore pure, and you will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p><strong>Of the Two Classes of Voluptuous Men, and of Their Death, Falling Away, and the Duration of Their Punishment.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Sitting in my house, and glorifying the Lord for all that I had seen, and reflecting on the commandments, that they are excellent, and powerful, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and able to save a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I said within myself, <q>I shall be blessed if I walk in these commandments, and every one who walks in them will be blessed.</q> While I was saying these words to myself, I suddenly see him sitting beside me, and hear him thus speak: <q>Why are you in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the commandments which I gave you? They are excellent: have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about them at all, but put on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and you will walk in them, for I will strengthen you in them. These commandments are beneficial to those who intend to repent: for if they do not walk in them, their repentance is in vain. You, therefore, who repent cast away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this world which wears you out; and by putting on all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, you will be able to keep these commandments, and will no longer add to the number of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Walk,  therefore, in these commandments of mine, and you will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All these things have been spoken to you by me.</q> And after he had uttered these words, he said to me, <q>Let us go into the fields, and I will show you the shepherds of the flocks.</q> <q>Let us go, sir,</q> I replied. And we came to a certain plain, and he showed me a young man, a shepherd, clothed in a suit of garments of a yellow colour: and he was herding very many sheep, and these sheep were feeding luxuriously, as it were, and riotously, and merrily skipping hither and there. The shepherd himself was merry, because of his flock; and the appearance of the shepherd was joyous, and he was running about among his flock. [And other sheep I saw rioting and luxuriating in one place, but not, however, leaping about. ]</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>And he said to me, <q>Do you see this shepherd?</q> <q>I see him, sir,</q> I said. <q>This,</q> he answered, <q>is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>  of luxury and deceit: he wears out the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and perverts them from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, deceiving them with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires, through which they will perish; for they forget the commandments of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and walk in deceits and empty luxuries; and they are ruined by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, some being brought to death, others to corruption.</q>  I said to him, <q>Sir, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of these words, 'to death, and to corruption.'</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said. <q>The sheep which you saw merry and leaping about, are those which have torn themselves away from God for ever, and have delivered themselves over to luxuries and deceits  [of this world. Among them there is no return to life through repentance, because they have added to their other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the name of the Lord. Such men therefore, are appointed unto death.  And the sheep which you saw not leaping, but feeding in one place, are they who have delivered themselves over to luxury and deceit], but have committed no <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Lord. These have been perverted from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: among them there is the hope of repentance, by which it is possible to live. Corruption, then, has a hope of a kind of renewal,  but death has everlasting ruin.</q> Again I went forward a little way, and he showed me a tall shepherd, somewhat savage in his appearance, clothed in a white goatskin, and having a wallet on his shoulders, and a very hard staff with branches, and a large whip. And he had a very sour look, so that I was afraid of him, so forbidding was his aspect. This shepherd, accordingly, was receiving the sheep from the young shepherd, those, viz., that were rioting and luxuriating, but not leaping; and he cast them into a precipitous place, full of thistles and thorns, so that it was impossible to extricate the sheep from the thorns and thistles; but they were completely entangled among them. These, accordingly, thus entangled, pastured among the thorns and thistles, and were exceedingly miserable, being beaten by him; and he drove them hither and there, and gave them no rest; and, altogether, these sheep were in a wretched plight.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Seeing them, therefore, so beaten and so badly used, I was grieved for them, because they were so tormented, and had no rest at all. And I said to the Shepherd who talked with me, <q>Sir, who is this shepherd, who is so pitiless and severe, and so completely devoid of compassion for these sheep?</q> <q>This,</q> he replied, <q>is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of punishment;  and he belongs to the just <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and is appointed to punish. He accordingly takes those who wander away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who have walked in the desires and deceits of this world, and chastises them as they deserve with terrible and diverse punishments.</q> <q>I would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sir,</q> I said, <q>Of what nature are these diverse tortures and punishments?</q> <q>Hear,</q> he said, <q>the various tortures and punishments. The tortures are such as occur during life.  For some are punished with losses, others with want, others with sicknesses of various kinds, and others with all kinds of disorder and confusion; others are insulted by unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and exposed to suffering in many other ways: for many, becoming unstable in their plans, try many things, and none of them at all succeed, and they say they are not prosperous in their undertakings; and it does not occur to their minds that they have done <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, but they blame the Lord.  When, therefore, they have been afflicted with all kinds of affliction, then are they delivered unto me for good training, and they are made strong in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord; and  for the rest of the days of their life they are subject to the Lord with pure hearts, and are successful in all their undertakings, obtaining from the Lord everything they ask; and then they glorify the Lord, that they were delivered to me, and no longer suffer any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>I said to him, <q>Sir, explain this also to me.</q> <q>What is it you ask?</q> he said. <q>Whether, sir,</q> I continued, <q>they who indulge in luxury, and who are deceived, are tortured for the same period of time that they have indulged in luxury and deceit?</q> He said to me, <q>They are tortured in the same manner.</q>  [<q>They are tormented much less, sir,</q> I replied; ] <q>for those who are so luxurious and who forget God ought to be tortured seven-fold.</q> He said to me <q>You are foolish, and do not understand the power of torment.</q> <q>Why, sir,</q> I said, <q>if I had understood it, I would not have asked you to show me.</q> <q>Hear,</q> he said, <q>the power of both. The time of luxury and deceit is one hour; but the hour of torment is equivalent to thirty days. If, accordingly, a man indulge in luxury for one day, and be deceived and be tortured for one day, the day of his torture is equivalent to a whole year. For all the days of luxury, therefore, there are as many years of torture to be undergone. You see, then,</q> he continued, <q>that the time of luxury and deceit is very short,  but that of punishment and torture long.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p><q>Still,</q> I said, <q>I do not quite understand about the time of deceit, and luxury, and torture; explain it to me more clearly.</q> He answered, and said to me, <q>Your folly is persistent; and you do not wish to purify your heart, and serve God. Have a care,</q> he added, <q>lest the time be fulfilled, and you be found foolish. Hear now,</q> he added, <q>as you desire, that you may understand these things. He who indulges in luxury, and is deceived for one day, and who does what he wishes, is clothed with much foolishness, and does not understand the act which he does until the morrow; for he forgets what he did the day before. For luxury and deceit have no memories, on account of the folly with which they are clothed; but when punishment and torture cleave to a man for one day, he is punished and tortured for a year; for punishment and torture have powerful memories. While tortured and punished, therefore, for a whole year, he remembers at last  his luxury and deceit, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that on their account he suffers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Every man, therefore, who is luxurious and deceived is thus tormented, because, although having life, they have given themselves over to death.</q> <q>What kinds of luxury, sir,</q> I asked, <q>are hurtful?</q> <q>Every act of a man which he performs with pleasure,</q> he replied, <q>is an act of luxury; for the sharp-tempered man, when gratifying his tendency, indulges in luxury; and the adulterer, and the drunkard, and the back-biter, and the liar, and the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, and the thief, and he who does things like these, gratifies his peculiar propensity, and in so doing indulges in luxury. All these acts of luxury are hurtful to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On account of these deceits, therefore, do they suffer, who are punished and tortured. And there are also acts of luxury which save men; for many who do good indulge in luxury, being carried away by their own pleasure:  this luxury, however, is beneficial to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gains life for such a man; but the injurious acts of luxury before enumerated bring tortures and punishment upon them; and if they continue in them and do not repent, they bring death upon themselves.</q></p>

<p><strong>They Who Repent Must Bring Forth Fruits Worthy of Repentance.</strong></p>

<p>After a few days I saw him in the same plain where I had also seen the shepherds; and he said to me, <q>What do you wish with me?</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, that you would order the shepherd who punishes to depart out of my house, because he afflicts me exceedingly.</q> <q>It is necessary,</q> he replied, <q>that you be afflicted; for thus,</q> he continued, <q>did the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> command concerning you, as he wishes you to be tried.</q> <q>What have I done which is so bad, sir,</q> I replied, <q>that I should be delivered over to this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>?</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are many, but not so great as to require that <em>you</em> be delivered over to this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but your household has committed great iniquities and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has been incensed at them on account of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and for this reason he commanded you to be afflicted for a certain time, that they also might repent, and purify themselves from every desire of this world. When, therefore, they repent and are purified, then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of punishment will depart.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, if they have done such things as to <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> against them, yet what have I done?</q> He replied, <q>They cannot be afflicted at all, unless you, the head of the house, be afflicted: for when you are afflicted, of necessity they also suffer affliction; but if you are in comfort, they can feel no affliction.</q> <q>Well, sir,</q> I said, <q>they have repented with their whole heart.</q> <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, too,</q> he answered, <q>that they have repented with their whole heart: do you think, however, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who repent are remitted?  Not altogether, but he who repents must torture his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and be exceedingly <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in all his conduct, and be afflicted with many kinds of affliction; and if he endure the afflictions that come upon him, He who created all things, and endued them with power, will assuredly have compassion, and will heal him; and this will He do when He sees the heart of every penitent pure from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing:  and it is profitable for you and for your house to suffer affliction now. But why should I say much to you? You must be afflicted, as that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord commanded who delivered you to me. And for this give thanks to the Lord, because He has deemed you worthy of showing you beforehand this affliction, that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it before it comes, you may be able to bear it with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.</q>  I said to him, <q>Sir, be with me, and I will be able to bear all affliction.</q> <q>I will be with you,</q> he said, <q>and I will ask the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of punishment to afflict you more lightly; nevertheless, you will be afflicted for a little time, and again you will be re-established in your house. Only continue <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and serve the Lord in all purity of heart, you and your children, and your house, and walk in my commands which I enjoin upon you, and your repentance will be deep and pure; and if you observe these things with your household, every affliction will depart from you.  And affliction,</q> he added, <q>will depart from all who walk in these my commandments.</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>He showed me a large willow tree overshadowing plains and mountains, and under the shade of this willow had assembled all those who were called by the name of the Lord. And a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, who was very tall, was standing beside the willow, having a large pruning-knife, and he was cutting little twigs from the willow and distributing them among the people that were overshadowed by the willow; and the twigs which he gave them were small, about a cubit, as it were, in length. And after they had all received the twigs, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> laid down the pruning-knife, and that tree was sound, as I had seen it at first. And I marvelled within myself, saying, <q>How is the tree sound, after so many branches have been cut off?</q> And the Shepherd said to me, <q>Do not be surprised if the tree remains sound after so many branches were lopped off; [but wait, ] and when you shall have seen everything, then it will be explained to you what it means.</q> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who had distributed the branches among the people again asked them from them, and in the order in which they had received them were they summoned to him, and each one of them returned his branch. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord took and looked at them. From some he received the branches withered and moth-eaten; those who returned branches in that state the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord ordered to stand apart. Others, again, returned them withered, but not moth-eaten; and these he ordered to stand apart. And others returned them half-withered, and these stood apart; and others returned their branches half-withered and having cracks in them, and these stood apart. [And others returned their branches green and having cracks in them; and these stood apart. ] And others returned their branches, one-half withered and the other green; and these stood apart. And others brought their branches two-thirds green and the remaining third withered; and these stood apart. And others returned them two-thirds withered and one-third green; and these stood apart. And others returned their branches nearly all green, the smallest part only, the top, being withered, but they had cracks in them; and these stood apart. And of others very little was green, but the remaining parts withered; and these stood apart. And others came bringing their branches green, as they had received them from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. And the majority of the crowd returned branches of that kind, and with these the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was exceedingly pleased; and these stood apart. [And others returned their branches green and having offshoots; and these stood apart, and with these the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was exceedingly delighted. ] And others returned their branches green and with offshoots, and the offshoots had some fruit, as it were;  and those men whose branches were found to be of that kind were exceedingly joyful. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was exultant because of them; and the Shepherd also rejoiced greatly because of them.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord ordered crowns to be brought;  and there were brought crowns, formed, as it were, of palms; and he crowned the men who had returned the branches which had offshoots and some fruit, and sent them away into the tower. And the others also he sent into the tower, those, namely, who had returned branches that were green and had offshoots but no fruit, having given them seals.  And all who went into the tower had the same clothing&mdash; white as snow.  And those who returned their branches green, as they had received them, he set free, giving them clothing and seals. Now after the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had finished these things, he said to the Shepherd, <q>I am going away, and you will send these away within the walls, according as each one is worthy to have his dwelling. And examine their branches carefully, and so dismiss them; but examine them with <em>care.</em> See that no one escape you,</q> he added; <q>and if any escape you, I will try them at the altar.</q>  Having said these words to the Shepherd, he departed. And after the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had departed, the Shepherd said to me, <q>Let us take the branches of all these and plant them, and see if any of them will live.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, how can these withered branches live?</q> He answered, and said, <q>This tree is a willow, and of a kind that is very tenacious of life. If, therefore, the branches be planted, and receive a little moisture, many of them will live. And now let us try, and pour water  upon them; and if any of them live I shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them, and if they do not I at least will not be found neglectful.</q> And the Shepherd bade me call them as each one was placed. And they came, rank by rank, and gave their branches to the Shepherd. And the Shepherd received the branches, and planted them in rows; and after he had planted them he poured much water upon them, so that the branches could not be seen for the water; and after the branches had drunk it in, he said to me, <q>Let us go, and return after a few days, and inspect all the branches; for He who created this tree wishes all those to live who received branches  from it. And I also hope that the greater part of these branches which received moisture and drank of the water will live.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>I said to him, <q>Sir, explain to me what this tree means, for I am perplexed about it, because, after so many branches have been cut off, it continues sound, and nothing appears to have been cut away from it. By this, now, I am perplexed.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>This great tree  that casts its shadow over plains, and mountains, and all the earth, is the law of God that was given to the whole world; and this law is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,  proclaimed to the ends of the earth; and the people who are under its shadow are they who have heard the proclamation, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> upon Him. And the great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Michael is he who has authority over this people, and governs them;  for this is he who gave them the law  into the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>: he accordingly superintends them to whom he gave it, to see if they have kept the same. And you see the branches of each one, for the branches are the law. You see, accordingly, many branches that have been rendered useless, and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them all&mdash; those who have not kept the law; and you will see the dwelling of each one.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, why did he dismiss some into the tower, and leave others to you?</q> <q>All,</q> he answered, <q>who transgressed the law which they received from him, he left under my power for repentance; but all who have satisfied the law, and kept it, he retains under his own authority.</q> <q>Who, then,</q> I continued, <q>are they who were crowned, and who go to the tower?</q> <q>These are they who have suffered on account of the law; but the others, and they who returned their branches green, and with offshoots, but without fruit, are they who have been afflicted on account of the law, but who have not suffered nor denied  their law; and they who returned their branches green as they had received them, are the venerable, and the just, and they who have walked carefully in a pure heart, and have kept the commandments of the Lord. And the rest you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when I have examined those branches which have been planted and watered.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>And after a few days we came to the place, and the Shepherd sat down in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> place, and I stood beside him. And he said to me, <q>Gird yourself with pure, undressed linen made of sackcloth;</q> and seeing me girded, and ready to minister to him, <q>Summon,</q> he said, <q>the men to whom belong the branches that were planted, according to the order in which each one gave them in.</q> So I went away to the plain, and summoned them all, and they all stood in their ranks. He said to them, <q>Let each one pull out his own branch, and bring it to me.</q> The first to give in were those who had them withered and cut; and  because they were found to be thus withered and cut, he commanded them to stand apart. And next they gave them in who had them withered, but not cut. And some of them gave in their branches green, and some withered and eaten as by a moth. Those that gave them in green, accordingly, he ordered to stand apart; and those who gave them in dry and cut, he ordered to stand along with the first. Next they gave them in who had them half-withered and cracked;  and many of them gave them in green and without cracks; and some green and with offshoots and fruits upon the offshoots, such as they had who went, after being crowned, into the tower. And some handed them in withered and eaten, and some withered and uneaten; and some as they were, half-withered and cracked. And he commanded them each one to stand apart, some towards their own rows, and others apart from them.</p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>Then they gave in their branches who had them green, but cracked: all these gave them in green, and stood in their own row. And the Shepherd was pleased with these, because they were all changed, and had lost their cracks.  And they also gave them in who had them half-green and half-withered: of some, accordingly, the branches were found completely green; of others, half-withered; of others, withered and eaten; of others, green, and having offshoots. All these were sent away, each to his own row. [Next they gave in who had them two parts green and one-third withered. Many of them gave them half-withered; and others withered and rotten; and others half-withered and cracked, and a few green. These all stood in their own row. ] And they gave them in who had them green, but to a very slight extent withered and cracked.  Of these, some gave them in green, and others green and with offshoots. And these also went away to their own row. Next they gave them who had a very small part green and the other parts withered. Of these the branches were found for the most part green and having offshoots, and fruit upon the offshoots, and others altogether green. With these branches the Shepherd was exceedingly pleased, because they were found in this state. And these went away, each to his own row.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>After the Shepherd had examined the branches of them all, he said to me, <q>I told you that this tree was tenacious of life. You see,</q> he continued, <q>how many repented and were saved.</q> <q>I see, sir,</q> I replied. <q>That you may behold,</q> he added, <q>the great mercy of the Lord, that it is great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and that He has given His Spirit to those who are worthy of repentance.</q> <q>Why then, sir,</q> I said, <q>did not all these repent?</q> He answered, <q>To them whose heart He saw would become pure, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to Him, He gave power to repent with the whole heart. But to them whose deceit and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> He perceived, and saw that they intended to repent hypocritically, He did not grant repentance,  lest they should again profane His name.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, show me now, with respect to those who gave in the branches, of what sort they are, and their abode, in order that they hearing it who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and received the seal, and broke it, and did not keep it whole, may, on coming to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, repent, and receive from you a seal, and may glorify the Lord because He had compassion upon them, and sent you to renew their spirits.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>they whose branches were found withered and moth-eaten are the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> and traitors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the Lord in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and have, moreover, been ashamed of the name of the Lord by which they were called.  These, therefore, at the end were lost unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And you see that not a single one of them repented, although they heard the words which I spoke to them, which I enjoined upon you. From such life departed.  And they who gave them in withered and undecayed, these also were near to them; for they were hypocrites, and introducers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>, and subverters of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially of those who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, not allowing them to repent, but persuading them by foolish doctrines.  These, accordingly, have a hope of repentance. And you see that many of them also have repented since I spoke to them, and they will still repent. But all who will not repent have lost their lives; and as many of them as repented became good, and their dwelling was appointed within the first walls; and some of them ascended even into the tower. You see, then,</q> he said, <q>that repentance involves life to sinners, but non-repentance death.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p><q>And as many as gave in the branches half-withered and cracked, hear also about them. They whose branches were half-withered to the same extent are the wavering; for they neither live, nor are they dead. And they who have them half-withered and cracked are both waverers and slanderers, [railing against the absent,] and never at peace with one another, but always at variance. And yet to these also,</q> he continued, <q>repentance is possible. You see,</q> he said, <q>that some of them have repented, and there is still remaining in them,</q> he continued, <q>a hope of repentance. And as many of them,</q> he added, <q>as have repented, shall have their dwelling in the tower. And those of them who have been slower in repenting shall dwell within the walls. And as many as do not repent at all, but abide in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, shall utterly perish. And they who gave in their branches green and cracked were always faithful and good, though emulous of each other about the foremost places, and about fame:  now all these are foolish, in indulging in such a rivalry. Yet they also, being naturally good,  on hearing my commandments, purified themselves, and soon repented. Their dwelling, accordingly, was in the tower. But if any one relapse into strife, he will be east out of the tower, and will lose his life.  Life is the possession of all who keep the commandments of the Lord; but in the commandments there is no rivalry in regard to the first places, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of any kind, but in regard to patience and personal humility. Among such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, then, is the life of the Lord, but among the quarrelsome and transgressors, death.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p><q>And they who gave in their branches half-green and half-withered, are those who are immersed in business, and do not cleave to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For this reason, the one half of them is living, and the other half dead.  Many, accordingly, who heard my commands repented, and those at least who repented had their dwelling in the tower. But some of them at last fell away: these, accordingly, have not repentance, for on account of their business they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the Lord, and denied Him. They therefore lost their lives through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which they committed. And many of them <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. These still have repentance in their power, if they repent speedily; and their abode will be in the tower. But if they are slower in repenting, they will dwell within the walls; and if they do not repent, they too have lost their lives. And they who gave in their branches two-thirds withered and one-third green, are those who have denied [the Lord] in various ways. Many, however, repented, but some of them hesitated and were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. These, then, have repentance within their reach, if they repent quickly, and do not remain in their pleasures;  but if they abide in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, these, too, work to themselves death.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p><q>And they who returned their branches two-thirds withered and one-third green, are those that were faithful indeed; but after acquiring <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and becoming distinguished among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, they clothed themselves with great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and became lofty-minded, and deserted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and did not cleave to the righteous, but lived with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and this way of life became more agreeable to them.  They did not, however, depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but remained in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, although not working the works of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Many of them accordingly repented, and their dwelling was in the tower. And others continuing to live until the end with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and being corrupted by their vain glories, [departed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, serving the works and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. ] These were reckoned with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But others of them hesitated, not hoping to be saved on account of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they had done; while others were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and caused divisions among themselves. To those, therefore, who were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on account of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, repentance is still open; but their repentance ought to be speedy, that their dwelling may be in the tower. And to those who do not repent, but abide in their pleasures, death is near.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p><q>And they who give in their branches green, but having the tips withered and cracked, these were always good, and faithful, and distinguished before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a very little through indulging small desires, and finding little faults with one another. But on hearing my words the greater part of them quickly repented, and their dwelling was upon the tower. Yet some of them were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and certain of them who were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> wrought greater dissension. Among these, therefore, is hope of repentance, because they were always good; and with difficulty will any one of them perish. And they who gave up their branches withered,  but having a very small part green, are those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> only, yet continue working the works of iniquity. They never, however, departed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but gladly bore His name, and joyfully received His servants into their houses.  Having accordingly heard of this repentance, they unhesitatingly repented, and practice all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and righteousness; and some of them even [suffered, being willingly <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> ], <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they had done. Of all these, therefore, the dwelling shall be in the tower.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>And after he had finished the explanations of all the branches, he said to me, <q>Go and tell them to every one, that they may repent, and they shall live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Because the Lord, having had compassion on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, has sent me to give repentance, although some are not worthy of it on account of their works; but the Lord, being long-suffering, desires those who were called by His Son to be saved.</q>  I said to him, <q>Sir, I hope that all who have heard them will repent; for I am persuaded that each one, on coming to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his own works, and fearing the Lord, will repent.</q> He answered me, and said, <q>All who with their whole heart shall purify themselves from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> before enumerated, and shall add no more to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, will receive healing from the Lord for their former transgressions, if they do not hesitate at these commandments; and they will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But do you walk in my commandments, and live.</q> Having shown me these things, and spoken all these words, he said to me, <q>And the rest I will show you after a few days.</q></p>

<h2>Similitude 9</h2>

<p><strong>The Great Mysteries in the Building of the Militant and Triumphant Church.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>After I had written down the commandments and similitudes of the Shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, he came to me and said, <q>I wish to explain to you what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>  that spoke with you in the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> showed you, for that Spirit is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For, as you were somewhat weak in the flesh, it was not explained to you by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. When, however, you were strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and your strength was increased, so that you were able to see the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> also, then accordingly was the building of the tower shown you by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In a noble and solemn manner did you see everything as if shown you by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; but now you see [them] through the same Spirit as if shown by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. You must, however, learn everything from me with greater accuracy. For I was sent for this purpose by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to dwell in your house, that you might see all things with power, entertaining no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, even as it was before.</q> And he led me away into Arcadia, to a round hill;  and he placed me on the top of the hill, and showed me a large plain, and round about the plain twelve mountains, all having different forms. The first was black as soot; and the second bare, without grass; and the third full of thorns and thistles; and the fourth with grass half-withered, the upper parts of the plants green, and the parts about the roots withered; and some of the grasses, when the sun scorched them, became withered. And the fifth mountain had green grass, and was ragged. And the sixth mountain was quite full of clefts, some small and others large; and the clefts were grassy, but the plants were not very vigorous, but rather, as it were, decayed. The seventh mountain, again, had cheerful pastures, and the whole mountain was blooming, and every kind of cattle and birds were feeding upon that mountain; and the more the cattle and the birds ate, the more the grass of that mountain flourished. And the eighth mountain was full of fountains, and every kind of the Lord's creatures drank of the fountains of that mountain. But the ninth mountain [had no water at all, and was wholly a desert, and had within it deadly serpents, which destroy men. And the tenth mountain ] had very large trees, and was completely shaded, and under the shadow of the trees sheep lay resting and ruminating. And the eleventh mountain was very thickly wooded, and those trees were productive, being adorned with various sorts of fruits, so that any one seeing them would desire to eat of their fruits. The twelfth mountain, again, was wholly white, and its aspect was cheerful, and the mountain in itself was very beautiful.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>And in the middle of the plain he showed me a large white rock that had arisen out of the plain. And the rock was more lofty than the mountains, rectangular in shape, so as to be capable of containing the whole world: and that rock was old, having a gate cut out of it; and the cutting out of the gate seemed to me as if recently done. And the gate glittered to such a degree under the sunbeams, that I marvelled at the splendour of the gate;  and round about the gate were standing twelve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. The four who stood at the corners seemed to me more distinguished than the others&mdash; they were all, however, distinguished&mdash; and they were standing at the four parts of the gate; two <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> between each part. And they were clothed with linen tunics, and gracefully girded, having their right shoulders exposed, as if about to bear some burden. Thus they stood ready; for they were exceedingly cheerful and eager. After I had seen these things, I marvelled in myself, because I was beholding great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> sights. And again I was perplexed about the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, because, although so delicate, they were standing courageously, as if about to carry the whole heavens. And the Shepherd said to me <q>Why are you reasoning in yourself, and perplexing your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and distressing yourself? For the things which you cannot understand, do not attempt to comprehend, as if you were wise; but ask the Lord, that you may receive understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. You cannot see what is behind you, but you see what is before. Whatever, then, you cannot see, let alone, and do not torment yourself about it: but what you see, make yourself master of it, and do not waste your labour about other things; and I will explain to you everything that I show you. Look therefore, on the things that remain.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>I saw six men come, tall, and distinguished, and similar in appearance, and they summoned a multitude of men. And they who came were also tall men, and handsome, and powerful; and the six men commanded them to build a tower  above the rock. And great was the noise of those men who came to build the tower, as they ran here and there around the gate. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who stood around the gate told the men to hasten to build the tower. Now the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> had spread out their hands, as if about to receive something from the men. And the six men commanded stones to ascend out of a certain pit, and to go to the building of the tower. And there went up ten shining rectangular stones, not hewn in a quarry. And the six men called the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and bade them carry all the stones that were intended for the building, and to pass through the gate, and give them to the men who were about to build the tower. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> put upon one another the ten first stones which had ascended from the pit, and carried them together, each stone by itself.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>And as they stood together around the gate, those who seemed to be strong carried them, and they stooped down under the corners of the stone; and the others stooped down under the sides of the stones. And in this way they carried all the stones.  And they carried them through the gate as they were commanded, and gave them to the men for the tower; and they took the stones and proceeded with the building. Now the tower was built upon the great rock, and above the gate. Those ten stones were prepared as the foundation for the building of the tower. And the rock and gate were the support of the whole of the tower. And after the ten stones other twenty [five] came up out of the pit, and these were fitted into the building of the tower, being carried by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> as before. And after these ascended thirty-five. And these in like manner were fitted into the tower. And after these other forty stones came up; and all these were cast into the building of the tower, [and there were four rows in the foundation of the tower, ] and they ceased ascending from the pit. And the builders also ceased for a little. And again the six men commanded the multitude of the crowd to bear stones from the mountains for the building of the tower. They were accordingly brought from all the mountains of various colours, and being hewn by the men were given to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> carried them through the gate, and gave them for the building of the tower. And when the stones of various colours were placed in the building, they all became white alike, and lost their different colours. And certain stones were given by the men for the building, and these did not become shining; but as they were placed, such also were they found to remain: for they were not given by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, nor carried through the gate. These stones, therefore, were not in keeping with the others in the building of the tower. And the six men, seeing these unsuitable stones in the building, commanded them to be taken away, and to be carried away down to their own place whence they had been taken; [and being removed one by one, they were laid aside; and] they say to the men who brought the stones, <q>Do not bring any stones at all for the building, but lay them down beside the tower, that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> may carry them through the gate, and may give them for the building. For unless,</q> they said, <q>they be carried through the gate by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, they cannot change their colours: do not toil, therefore,</q> they said, <q>to no purpose.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>And on that day the building was finished, but the tower was not completed; for additional building was again about to be added, and there was a cessation in the building. And the six men commanded the builders all to withdraw a little distance, and to rest, but enjoined the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> not to withdraw from the tower; and it seemed to me that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> had been left to guard the tower. Now after all had withdrawn, and were resting themselves, I said to the Shepherd, <q>What is the reason that the building of the tower was not finished?</q> <q>The tower,</q> he answered, <q>cannot be finished just yet, until the Lord of it come and examine the building, in order that, if any of the stones be found to be decayed, he may change them: for the tower is built according to his pleasure.</q> <q>I would like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sir,</q> I said, <q>what is the meaning of the building of this tower, and what the rock and gate, and the mountains, and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> mean, and the stones that ascended from the pit, and were not hewn, but came as they were to the building. Why, in the first place, were ten stones placed in the foundation, then twenty-five, then thirty-five, then forty? And I wish also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the stones that went to the building, and were again taken out and returned to their own place? On all these points put my mind at rest, sir, and explain them to me.</q> <q>If you are not found to be curious about trifles,</q> he replied, <q>you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything. For after a few days [we shall come hither, and you will see the other things that happen to this tower, and will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> accurately all the similitudes.</q> After a few days ] we came to the place where we sat down. And he said to me, <q>Let us go to the tower; for the master of the tower is coming to examine it.</q> And we came to the tower, and there was no one at all near it, save the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> only. And the Shepherd asked the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> if perchance the master of the tower had come; and they replied that he was about to come  to examine the building.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>And, behold, after a little I see an array of many men coming, and in the midst of them one man  of so remarkable a size as to overtop the tower. And the six men who had worked upon the building were with him, and many other <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> men were around him. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who kept the tower ran forward and kissed him, and began to walk near him around the tower. And that man examined the building carefully, feeling every stone separately; and holding a rod in his hand, he struck every stone in the building three times. And when he struck them, some of them became black as soot, and some appeared as if covered with scabs, and some cracked, and some mutilated, and some neither white nor black, and some rough and not in keeping with the other stones, and some having [very many] stains: such were the varieties of decayed stones that were found in the building. He ordered all these to be taken out of the tower, and to be laid down beside it, and other stones to be brought and put in their stead. [And the builders asked him from what mountain he wished them to be brought and put in their place. ] And he did not command them to be brought from the mountains, [but he bade them be brought from a certain plain which was near at hand. ] And the plain was dug up, and shining rectangular stones were found, and some also of a round shape; and all the stones which were in that plain were brought, and carried through the gate by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. And the rectangular stones were hewn, and put in place of those that were taken away; but the rounded stones were not put into the building, because they were hard to hew, and appeared to yield slowly to the chisel; they were deposited, however, beside the tower, as if intended to be hewn and used in the building, for they were exceedingly brilliant.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> man, the lord of the whole tower, having accordingly finished these alterations, called to him the Shepherd, and delivered to him all the stones that were lying beside the tower, that had been rejected from the building, and said to him, <q>Carefully clean all these stones, and put aside such for the building of the tower as may harmonize with the others; and those that do not, throw far away from the tower.</q> [Having given these orders to the Shepherd, he departed from the tower ], with all those with whom he had come. Now the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> were standing around the tower, keeping it. I said again to the Shepherd, <q>Can these stones return to the building of the tower, after being rejected?</q> He answered me, and said, <q>Do you see these stones?</q> <q>I see them, sir,</q> I replied. <q>The greater part of these stones,</q> he said, <q>I will hew, and put into the building, and they will harmonize with the others.</q> <q>How, sir,</q> I said, <q>can they, after being cut all round about, fill up the same space?</q> He answered, <q>Those that shall be found small will be thrown into the middle of the building, and those that are larger will be placed on the outside, and they will hold them together.</q> Having spoken these words, he said to me, <q>Let us go, and after two days let us come and clean these stones, and cast them into the building; for all things around the tower must be cleaned, lest the Master come suddenly  and find the places about the tower dirty, and be displeased, and these stones be not returned for the building of the tower, and I also shall seem to be neglectful towards the Master.</q> And after two days we came to the tower, and he said to me, <q>Let us examine all the stones, and ascertain those which may return to the building.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, let us examine them!</q></p> 
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>And beginning, we first examined the black stones. And such as they had been taken out of the building, were they found to remain; and the Shepherd ordered them to be removed out of the tower, and to be placed apart. Next he examined those that had scabs; and he took and hewed many of these, and commanded the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to take them up and cast them into the building. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> lifted them up, and put them in the middle of the building of the tower. And the rest he ordered to be laid down beside the black ones; for these, too, were found to be black. He next examined those that had cracks; and he hewed many of these, and commanded them to be carried by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to the building: and they were placed on the outside, because they were found to be sounder than the others; but the rest, on account of the multitude of the cracks, could not be hewn, and for this reason, therefore, they were rejected from the building of the tower. He next examined the chipped stones, and many among these were found to be black, and some to have great cracks. And these also he commanded to be laid down along with those which had been rejected. But the remainder, after being cleaned and hewn, he commanded to be placed in the building. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> took them up, and fitted them into the middle of the building of the tower, for they were somewhat weak. He next examined those that were half white and half black, and many of them were found to be black. And he commanded these also to be taken away along with those which had been rejected. And the rest were all taken away by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; for, being white, they were fitted by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> themselves into the building. And they were placed upon the outside, because they were found to be sound, so as to be able to support those which were placed in the middle, for no part of them at all was chipped. He next examined those that were rough and hard; and a few of them were rejected because they could not be hewn, as they were found exceedingly hard. But the rest of them were hewn, and carried by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and fitted into the middle of the building of the tower; for they were somewhat weak. He next examined those that had stains; and of these a very few were black, and were thrown aside with the others; but the greater part were found to be bright, and these were fitted by the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> into the building, but on account of their strength were placed on the outside.</p>
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>He next came to examine the white and rounded stones, and said to me, <q>What are we to do with these stones?</q> <q>How do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sir?</q> I replied. <q>Have you no intentions regarding them?</q> <q>Sir,</q> I answered, <q>I am not acquainted with this art, neither am I a stone-cutter, nor can I tell.</q> <q>Do you not see,</q> he said, <q>that they are exceedingly round? And if I wish to make them rectangular, a large portion of them must be cut away; for some of them must of necessity be put into the building.</q> <q>If therefore,</q> I said, <q>they must, why do you torment yourself, and not at once choose for the building those which you prefer, and fit them into it?</q> He selected the larger ones among them, and the shining ones, and hewed them; and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> carried and fitted them into the outside parts of the building. And the rest which remained over were carried away, and laid down on the plain from which they were brought. They were not, however, rejected, <q>because,</q> he said, <q>there remains yet a little addition to be built to the tower. And the lord of this tower wishes all the stones to be fitted into the building, because they are exceedingly bright.</q> And twelve <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were called, very beautiful in form, clothed in black, and with dishevelled hair. And these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> seemed to me to be fierce. But the Shepherd commanded them to lift the stones that were rejected from the building, and to carry them away to the mountains from which they had been brought. And they were merry, and carried away all the stones, and put them in the place whence they had been taken. Now after all the stones were removed, and there was no longer a single one lying around the tower, he said, <q>Let us go round the tower and see, lest there be any defect in it.</q> So I went round the tower along with him. And the Shepherd, seeing that the tower was beautifully built, rejoiced exceedingly; for the tower was built in such a way, that, on seeing it, I <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> the building of it, for it was constructed as if built of one stone, without a single joining. And the stone seemed as if hewn out of the rock; having to me the appearance of a monolith.</p>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>And as I walked along with him, I was full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, beholding so many excellent things. And the Shepherd said to me, <q>Go and bring unslacked lime and fine-baked clay, that I may fill up the forms of the stones that were taken and thrown into the building; for everything about the tower must be smooth.</q> And I did as he commanded me, and brought it to him. <q>Assist me,</q> he said, <q>and the work will soon be finished.</q> He accordingly filled up the forms of the stones that were returned to the building, and commanded the places around the tower to be swept and to be cleaned; and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> took brooms and swept the place, and carried all the dirt out of the tower, and brought water, and the ground around the tower became cheerful and very beautiful. Says the Shepherd to me, <q>Everything has been cleared away; if the lord of the tower come to inspect it, he can have no fault to find with us.</q> Having spoken these words, he wished to depart; but I laid hold of him by the wallet, and began to <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> him by the Lord that he would explain what he had showed me. He said to me, <q>I must rest a little, and then I shall explain to you everything; wait for me here until I return.</q> I said to him, <q>Sir, what can I do here alone?</q> <q>You are not alone,</q> he said, <q>for these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are with you.</q> <q>Give me in charge to them, then,</q> I replied. The Shepherd called them to him, and said to them, <q>I entrust him to you until I come,</q> and went away. And I was alone with the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; and they were rather merry, but were friendly to me, especially the four more distinguished of them.</p>
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> said to me, <q>The Shepherd does not come here today.</q> <q>What, then,</q> said I, <q>am I to do?</q> They replied, <q>Wait for him until he comes; and if he comes he will converse with you, and if he does not come you will remain here with us until he does come.</q> I said to them, <q>I will wait for him until it is late; and if he does not arrive, I will go away into the house, and come back early in the morning.</q> And they answered and said to me, <q>You were entrusted to us; you cannot go away from us.</q> <q>Where, then,</q> I said, <q>am I to remain?</q> <q>You will sleep with us,</q> they replied, <q>as a brother, and not as a husband: for you are our brother, and for the time to come we intend to abide with you, for we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you exceedingly!</q> But I was ashamed to remain with them. And she who seemed to be the first among them began to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> me. [And the others seeing her kissing me, began also to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> me], and to lead me round the tower, and to play with me.  And I, too, became like a young man, and began to play with them: for some of them formed a chorus, and others danced, and others sang; and I, keeping silence, walked with them around the tower, and was merry with them. And when it grew late I wished to go into the house; and they would not let me, but detained me. So I remained with them during the night, and slept beside the tower. Now the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> spread their linen tunics on the ground, and made me lie down in the midst of them; and they did nothing at all but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; and I without ceasing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with them, and not less than they. And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> rejoiced because I thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. And I remained there with the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> until the next day at the second hour. Then the Shepherd returned, and said to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <q>Did you offer him any insult?</q> <q>Ask him,</q> they said. I said to him, <q>Sir, I was delighted that I remained with them.</q> <q>On what,</q> he asked, <q>did you sup?</q> <q>I supped, sir,</q> I replied, <q>on the words of the Lord the whole night.</q> <q>Did they receive you well?</q> he inquired. <q>Yes, sir,</q> I answered. <q>Now,</q> he said, <q>what do you wish to hear first?</q> <q>I wish to hear in the order,</q> I said, <q>in which you showed me from the beginning. I beg of you, sir, that as I shall ask you, so also you will give me the explanation.</q> <q>As you wish,</q> he replied, <q>so also will I explain to you, and will conceal nothing at all from you.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p><q>First of all, sir,</q> I said, <q>explain this to me: What is the meaning of the rock and the gate?</q> <q>This rock,</q> he answered, <q>and this gate are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <q>How, sir?</q> I said; <q>the rock is old, and the gate is new.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said, <q>and understand, O <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> man. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is older than all His creatures, so that He was a fellow-councillor with the Father in His work of creation:  for this reason is He old.</q> <q>And why is the gate new, sir?</q> I said. <q>Because,</q> he answered, <q>He became manifest  in the last days of the dispensation: for this reason the gate was made new, that they who are to be saved by it might enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. You saw,</q> he said, <q>that those stones which came in through the gate were used for the building of the tower, and that those which did not come, were again thrown back to their own place?</q> <q>I saw, sir,</q> I replied. <q>In like manner,</q> he continued, <q>no one shall enter into the kingdom of God unless he receive His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name. For if you desire to enter into a city, and that city is surrounded by a wall, and has but one gate, can you enter into that city save through the gate which it has?</q> <q>Why, how can it be otherwise, sir?</q> I said. <q>If, then, you cannot enter into the city except through its gate, so, in like manner, a man cannot otherwise enter into the kingdom of God than by the name of His beloved Son. You saw,</q> he added, <q>the multitude who were building the tower?</q> <q>I saw them, sir,</q> I said. <q>Those,</q> he said, <q>are all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and by them accordingly is the Lord surrounded. And the gate is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. This is the one entrance to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. In no other way, then, shall any one enter in to Him except through His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. You saw,</q> he continued, <q>the six men, and the tall and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> man in the midst of them, who walked round the tower, and rejected the stones from the building?</q> <q>I saw him, sir,</q> I answered. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> man,</q> he said, <q>is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and those six <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are those who support Him on the right hand and on the left. None of these <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> he continued, <q>will enter in unto God apart from Him. Whosoever does not receive His  name, shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p><q>And the tower,</q> I asked, <q>what does it mean?</q> <q>This tower,</q> he replied, <q>is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> <q>And these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who are they?</q> <q>They are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirits, and men cannot otherwise be found in the kingdom of God unless these have put their clothing upon them: for if you receive the name only, and do not receive from them the clothing, they are of no advantage to you. For these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. If you bear His name but possess not His power, it will be in vain that you bear His name. Those stones,</q> he continued, <q>which you saw rejected bore His name, but did not put on the clothing of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</q> <q>Of what nature is their clothing, sir?</q> I asked. <q>Their very names,</q> he said, <q>are their clothing. Every one who bears the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, ought to bear the names also of these; for the Son Himself bears the names  of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. As many stones,</q> he continued, <q>as you saw [come into the building of the tower through the hands ] of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and remaining, have been clothed with their strength. For this reason you see that the tower became of one stone with the rock. So also they who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Lord  through His Son, and are clothed with these spirits, shall become one spirit, one body, and the colour of their garments shall be one. And the dwelling of such as bear the names of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is in the tower.</q> <q>Those stones, sir, that were rejected,</q> I inquired, <q>on what account were they rejected? For they passed through the gate, and were placed by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the building of the tower.</q> <q>Since you take an interest in everything,</q> he replied, <q>and examine minutely, hear about the stones that were rejected. These all,</q> he said, <q>received the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they received also the strength of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Having received, then, these spirits, they were made strong, and were with the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and theirs was one spirit, and one body, and one clothing. For they were of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and wrought righteousness. After a certain time, however, they were persuaded by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> whom you saw clothed in black, and having their shoulders exposed and their hair dishevelled, and beautiful in appearance. Having seen these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they desired to have them, and clothed themselves with their strength, and put off the strength of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. These, accordingly, were rejected from the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were given over to these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. But they who were not deceived by the beauty of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> remained in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You have,</q> he said, <q>the explanation of those who were rejected.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p><q>What, then, sir,</q> I said, <q>if these men, being such as they are, repent and put away their desires after these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and return again to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and walk in their strength and in their works, shall they not enter into the house of God?</q> <q>They shall enter in,</q> he said, <q>if they put away the works of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and put on again the strength of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and walk in their works. For on this account was there a cessation in the building, in order that, if these repent, they may depart into the building of the tower. But if they do not repent, then others will come in their place, and these at the end will be cast out. For all these things I gave thanks to the Lord, because He had pity on all that call upon His name; and sent the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance to us who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Him, and renewed our spirit; and when we were already destroyed, and had no hope of life, He restored us to newness of life.</q> <q>Now, sir,</q> I continued, <q>show me why the tower was not built upon the ground, but upon the rock and upon the gate.</q> <q>Are you still,</q> he said, <q>without sense and understanding?</q> <q>I must, sir,</q> I said, <q>ask you of all things, because I am wholly unable to understand them; for all these things are great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and difficult for man to understand.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is great, and cannot be contained, and supports the whole world.  If, then, the whole creation is supported by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, what do you think of those who are called by Him, and bear the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and walk in His commandments? Do you see what kind of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> He supports? Those who bear His name with their whole heart. He Himself, accordingly, became a foundation  to them, and supports them with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because they are not ashamed to bear His name.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>

<p><q>Explain to me, sir,</q> I said, <q>the names of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and of those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were clothed in black raiment.</q> <q>Hear,</q> he said, <q>the names of the stronger <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who stood at the corners. The first is Faith,  the second Continence, the third Power, the fourth Patience. And the others standing in the midst of these have the following names: Simplicity, Innocence, Purity, Cheerfulness, Truth, Understanding, Harmony, Love. He who bears these names and that of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> will be able to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Hear, also,</q> he continued, <q>the names of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had the black garments; and of these four are stronger than the rest. The first is Unbelief, the second: Incontinence, the third Disobedience, the fourth Deceit. And their followers are called Sorrow, Wickedness, Wantonness, Anger, Falsehood, Folly, Backbiting, Hatred. The servant of God who bears these names shall see, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, but shall not enter into it.</q> <q>And the stones, sir,</q> I said, <q>which were taken out of the pit and fitted into the building: what are they?</q> <q>The first,</q> he said, <q>the ten, viz., that were placed as a foundation, are the first generation, and the twenty-five the second generation, of righteous men; and the thirty-five are the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His ministers; and the forty are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and teachers of the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q>  <q>Why, then, sir,</q> I asked, <q>did the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> carry these stones also through the gate, and give them for the building of the tower?</q> <q>Because,</q> he answered, <q>these were the first who bore these spirits, and they never departed from each other, neither the spirits from the men nor the men from the spirits, but the spirits remained with them until their falling asleep. And unless they had had these spirits with them, they would not have been of use for the building of this tower.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p><q>Explain to me a little further, sir,</q> I said. <q>What is it that you desire?</q> he asked. <q>Why, sir,</q> I said, <q>did these stones ascend out of the pit, and be applied to the building of the tower, after having borne these spirits?</q> <q>They were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>,</q> he answered, <q>to ascend through water in order that they might be made alive; for, unless they laid aside the deadness of their life, they could not in any other way enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Accordingly, those also who fell asleep received the seal of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For,</q> he continued, <q>before a man bears the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>  he is dead; but when he receives the seal he lays aside his deadness, and obtains life. The seal, then, is the water: they descend into the water dead, and they arise alive. And to them, accordingly, was this seal preached, and they made use of it that they might enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <q>Why, sir,</q> I asked, <q>did the forty stones also ascend with them out of the pit, having already received the seal?</q> <q>Because,</q> he said, <q>these <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and teachers who preached the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, after falling asleep in the power and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, preached it not only to those who were asleep, but themselves also gave them the seal of the preaching. Accordingly they descended with them into the water, and again ascended. [But these descended alive and rose up again alive; whereas they who had previously fallen asleep descended dead, but rose up again alive. ] By these, then, were they quickened and made to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For this reason also did they ascend with them, and were fitted along with them into the building of the tower, and, untouched by the chisel, were built in along with them. For they slept in righteousness and in great purity, but only they had not this seal. You have accordingly the explanation of these also.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p><q>I understand, sir,</q> I replied. <q>Now, sir,</q> I continued, <q>explain to me, with respect to the mountains, why their forms are various and diverse.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>these mountains are the twelve tribes, which inhabit the whole world.  The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, accordingly, was preached unto them by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</q> <q>But why are the mountains of various kinds, some having one form, and others another? Explain that to me, sir.</q> <q>Listen,</q> he answered: <q>these twelve tribes that inhabit the whole world are twelve nations. And they vary in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and understanding. As numerous, then, as are the varieties of the mountains which you saw, are also the diversities of mind and understanding among these nations. And I will explain to you the actions of each one.</q> <q>First, sir,</q> I said, <q>explain this: why, when the mountains are so diverse, their stones, when placed in the building, became one colour, shining like those also that had ascended out of the pit.</q> <q>Because,</q> he said, <q>all the nations that dwell under heaven were called by hearing and believing upon the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  Having, therefore, received the seal, they had one understanding and one mind; and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> became one, and their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one, and with the name they bore also the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.  On this account the building of the tower became of one colour, bright as the sun. But after they had entered into the same place, and became one body, certain of these defiled themselves, and were expelled from the race of the righteous, and became again what they were before, or rather worse.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>

<p><q>How, sir,</q> I said, <q>did they become worse, after having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God?</q>  <q>He that does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he answered, <q>and practices <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, receives a certain chastisement for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but he that has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought not any longer to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to do good. If, accordingly, when he ought to do good, he do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does not he appear to do greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than he who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God? For this reason, they who have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God and do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are condemned to death; but they who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have seen His mighty works, and still continue in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, shall be chastised doubly, and shall die for ever.  In this way, then, will the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> be purified. For as you saw the stones rejected from the tower, and delivered to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and cast out thence, so [they also shall be cast out, and ] there shall be one body of the purified; as the tower also became, as it were, of one stone after its purification. In like manner also shall it be with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, after it has been purified, and has rejected the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and the hypocrites, and the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, and the waverers, and those who commit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of different kinds. After these have been cast away, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> shall be one body, of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, of one understanding, of one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> will be exceeding glad, and shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over them, because He has received His people pure.</q>  <q>All these things, sir,</q> I said, <q>are great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</q></p>

<p><q>Moreover, sir,</q> I said, <q>explain to me the power and the actions of each one of the mountains, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, trusting in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and hearing it, may glorify His great, and marvellous, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name.</q> <q>Hear,</q> he said, <q>the diversity of the mountains and of the twelve nations.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p><q>From the first mountain, which was black, they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are the following: <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> against the Lord, and betrayers of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To these repentance is not open; but death lies before them, and on this account also are they black, for their race is a lawless one. And from the second mountain, which was bare, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are the following: hypocrites, and teachers of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And these, accordingly, are like the former, not having any fruits of righteousness; for as their mountain was destitute of fruit, so also such men have a name indeed, but are empty of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and there is no fruit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in them. They indeed have repentance in their power, if they repent quickly; but if they are slow in so doing, they shall die along with the former.</q> <q>Why, sir,</q> I said, <q>have these repentance, but the former not? For their actions are nearly the same.</q> <q>On this account,</q> he said, <q>have these repentance, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> their Lord, nor become betrayers of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but on account of their desire of possessions they became <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a>, and each one taught according to the desires of men that were sinners. But they will suffer a certain punishment; and repentance is before them, because they were not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> or traitors.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>

<p><q>And from the third mountain, which had thorns and thistles, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are the following. There are some of them rich, and others immersed in much business. The thistles are the rich, and the thorns are they who are immersed in much business. Those, [accordingly, who are entangled in many various kinds of business, do not ] cleave to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but wander away, being choked by their business transactions; and the rich cleave with difficulty to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fearing lest these should ask something of them. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, accordingly, shall have difficulty in entering the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. For as it is disagreeable to walk among thistles with naked feet, so also it is hard for such to enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.  But to all these repentance, and that speedy, is open, in order that what they did not do in former times they may make up for in these days, and do some good, and they shall live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if they abide in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, they shall be delivered to those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who will put them to death.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>

<p><q>And from the fourth mountain, which had much grass, the upper parts of the plants green, and the parts about the roots withered, and some also scorched by the sun, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are the following: the doubtful, and they who have the Lord upon their lips, but have Him not in their heart. On this account their foundations are withered, and have no strength; and their words alone live, while their works are dead. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are [neither alive nor ] dead. They resemble, therefore, the waverers: for the wavering are neither withered nor green, being neither living nor dead. For as their blades, on seeing the sun, were withered, so also the wavering, when they hear of affliction, on account of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and are ashamed of the name of their Lord.  Such, then, are neither alive nor dead. But these also may yet live, if they repent quickly; and if they do not repent, they are already delivered to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who take away their life.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>

<p><q>And from the fifth mountain, which had green grass, and was rugged, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> are the following: <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, indeed, but slow to learn, and obstinate, and pleasing themselves, wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing at all. On account of this obstinacy of theirs, understanding departed from them, and foolish senselessness entered into them. And they praise themselves as having wisdom, and desire to become teachers, although destitute of sense. On account, therefore, of this loftiness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, many became vain, exalting themselves: for self-will and empty confidence is a great <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. Of these, accordingly, many were rejected, but some repented and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and subjected themselves to those that had understanding, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> their own foolishness. And to the rest of this class repentance is open; for they were not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but rather foolish, and without understanding. If these therefore repent, they will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but if they do not repent, they shall have their dwelling with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who wrought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> among them.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>

<p><q>And those from the sixth mountain, which had clefts large and small, and decayed grass in the clefts, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, were the following: they who occupy the small clefts are those who bring charges against one another, and by reason of their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> have decayed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Many of them, however, repented; and the rest also will repent when they hear my commandments, for their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> are small, and they will quickly repent. But they who occupy the large clefts are persistent in their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, and vindictive in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against each other. These, therefore, were thrown away from the tower, and rejected from having a part in its building. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, accordingly, shall have difficulty in living. If our God and Lord, who rules over all things, and has power over all His creation, does not remember <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against those who confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but is merciful, does man, who is corruptible and full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, remember <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against a fellow-man, as if he were able to destroy or to save him?  I, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, say unto you, As many of you as are of this way of thinking, lay it aside, and repent, and the Lord will heal your former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if you purify yourselves from this <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; but if not, you will be delivered over to him for death.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>

<p><q>And those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from the seventh mountain, on which the grass was green and flourishing, and the whole of the mountain fertile, and every kind of cattle and the fowls of heaven were feeding on the grass on this mountain, and the grass on which they pastured became more abundant, were the following: they were always simple, and harmless, and blessed, bringing no charges against one another, but always rejoicing greatly because of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and being clothed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and always having pity on every man, and giving aid from their own labour to every man, without reproach and without hesitation.  The Lord, therefore, seeing their simplicity and all their meekness, multiplied them amid the labours of their hands, and gave them <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in all their doings. And I, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, say to you who are such, Continue to be such as these, and your seed will never be blotted out; for the Lord has made trial of you, and inscribed you in the number of us, and the whole of your seed will dwell with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; for you have received of His Spirit.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 25</h3>

<p><q>And they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from the eighth mountain, where were the many fountains, and where all the creatures of God drank of the fountains, were the following: <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and teachers, who preached to the whole world, and who taught solemnly and purely the word of the Lord, and did not at all fall into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, but walked always in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according as they had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, shall enter in with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> </p>
<h3>Chapter 26</h3>

<p><q>And they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from the ninth mountain, which was deserted, and had in it creeping things and wild beasts which destroy men, were the following: they who had the stains as servants,  who discharged their duty ill, and who plundered <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> of their livelihood, and gained possessions for themselves from the ministry, which they had received.  If, therefore, they remain under the dominion of the same desire, they are dead, and there is no hope of life for them; but if they repent, and finish their ministry in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> manner, they shall be able to live. And they who were covered with scabs are those who have denied their Lord, and have not returned to Him again; but becoming withered and desert-like, and not cleaving to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but living in solitude, they destroy their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For as a vine, when left within an enclosure, and meeting with neglect, is destroyed, and is made desolate by the weeds, and in time grows wild, and is no longer of any use to its master, so also are such men as have given themselves up, and become useless to their Lord, from having contracted savage habits. These men, therefore, have repentance in their power, unless they are found to have denied from the heart; but if any one is found to have denied from the heart, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if he may live. And I say this not for these present days, in order that any one who has denied may obtain repentance, for it is impossible for him to be saved who now intends to deny his Lord; but to those who denied Him long ago, repentance seems to be possible. If, therefore, any one intends to repent, let him do so quickly, before the tower is completed; for if not, he will be utterly destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And the chipped stones are the deceitful and the slanderers; and the wild beasts which you saw on the ninth mountain, are the same. For as wild beasts destroy and kill a man by their poison, so also do the words of such men destroy and ruin a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. These, accordingly, are mutilated in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they have done in themselves; yet some repented, and were saved. And the rest, who are of such a character, can be saved if they repent; but if they do not repent, they will perish with those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whose strength they have assumed.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 27</h3>

<p><q>And from the tenth mountain, where were trees which overshadowed certain sheep, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were the following: <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  given to hospitality, who always gladly received into their houses the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without dissimulation. And the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> never failed to protect, by their service, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and those who were in want, and always maintained a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conversation. All these, accordingly, shall be protected by the Lord for ever. They who do these things are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their place is already with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if they remain to the end serving God.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 28</h3>

<p><q>And from the eleventh mountain, where were trees full of fruits, adorned with fruits of various kinds, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were the following: they who suffered for the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and who also suffered cheerfully with their whole heart, and laid down their lives.</q> <q>Why, then, sir,</q> I said, <q>do all these trees bear fruit, and some of them fairer than the rest?</q> <q>Listen,</q> he said: <q>all who once suffered for the name of the Lord are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and of all these the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were remitted, because they suffered for the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  And why their fruits are of various kinds, and some of them superior, listen. All,</q> he continued, <q>who were brought before the authorities and were examined, and did not deny, but suffered cheerfully&mdash; these are held in greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of these the fruit is superior; but all who were cowards, and in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and who reasoned in their hearts whether they would deny or confess, and yet suffered, of these the fruit is less, because that suggestion came into their hearts; for that suggestion&mdash; that a servant should deny his Lord&mdash; is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Have a care, therefore, you who are planning such things, lest that suggestion remain in your hearts, and you perish unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And you who suffer for His name ought to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He deemed you worthy to bear His name, that all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might be healed. [Therefore, rather deem yourselves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>], and think that you have done a great thing, if any of you suffer on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Lord bestows upon you life, and you do not understand, for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were heavy; but if you had not suffered for the name of the Lord, you would have died to God on account of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. These things I say to you who are hesitating about denying or confessing: acknowledge that you have the Lord, lest, denying Him, you be delivered up to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> chastise their slaves, when one of them denies his master, what, do you think, will your Lord do, who has authority over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Put away these counsels out of your hearts, that you may live continually unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 29</h3>

<p><q>And they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from the twelfth mountain, which was white, are the following: they are as infant children, in whose hearts no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> originates; nor did they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is, but always remained as children. Such accordingly, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, dwell in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, because they defiled in nothing the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but they remained like children all the days of their life in the same mind. All of you, then, who shall remain steadfast, and be as children, <span class="stiki" id="note020391"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;18:3</a></span> without doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, will be more honoured than all who have been previously mentioned; for all infants are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are the first <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with Him.  Blessed, then, are you who put away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from yourselves, and put on innocence. As the first of all will you live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>After he had finished the similitudes of the mountains, I said to him, <q>Sir, explain to me now about the stones that were taken out of the plain, and put into the building instead of the stones that were taken out of the tower; and about the round stones that were put into the building; and those that still remain round.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 30</h3>

<p><q>Hear,</q> he answered, about all these also. The stones taken out of the plain and put into the building of the tower instead of those that were rejected, are the roots of this white mountain. When, therefore, they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from the white mountain were all found guileless, the Lord of the tower commanded those from the roots of this mountain to be cast into the building of the tower; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that if these stones were to go to the building of the tower, they would remain bright, and not one of them become black.  But if he had so resolved with respect to the other mountains, it would have been necessary for him to visit that tower again, and to cleanse it. Now all these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were found white who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who will yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, for they are of the same race. This is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> race, because it is innocent. Hear now, further, about these round and shining stones. All these also are from the white mountain. Hear, moreover, why they were found round: because their riches had obscured and darkened them a little from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although they never departed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor did any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word proceed out of their mouth, but all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. When the Lord, therefore, saw the mind of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that they were born good,  and could be good, He ordered their riches to be cut down, not to be taken  away for ever, that they might be able to do some good with what was left them; and they will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are of a good race. Therefore were they rounded a little by the chisel, and put in the building of the tower.</p>
<h3>Chapter 31</h3>

<p>But the other round stones, which had not yet been adapted to the building of the tower, and had not yet received the seal, were for this reason put back into their place, because they are exceedingly round. Now this age must be cut down in these things, and in the vanities of their riches, and then they will meet in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; for they must of necessity enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, because the Lord has blessed this innocent race. Of this race, therefore, no one will perish; for although any of them be tempted by the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he will quickly return to his Lord. I deem you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, I, who am the messenger of repentance, whoever of you are innocent as children,  because your part is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> before God. Moreover, I say to you all, who have received the seal of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, be clothed with simplicity, and be not mindful of offenses, nor remain in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Lay aside, therefore, the recollection of your offenses and bitternesses, and you will be formed in one spirit. And heal and take away from you those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> schisms, that if the Lord of the flocks come, He may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> concerning you. And He will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, if He find all things sound, and none of you shall perish. But if He find any one of these sheep strayed, woe to the shepherds! And if the shepherds themselves have strayed, what answer will they give Him for their flocks?  Will they perchance say that they were harassed by their flocks? They will not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, for the thing is incredible that a shepherd could suffer from his flock; rather will he be punished on account of his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. And I myself am a shepherd, and I am under a most stringent necessity of rendering an account of you.</p>
<h3>Chapter 32</h3>

<p><q>Heal yourselves, therefore, while the tower is still building. The Lord dwells in men that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace, because He loved peace; but from the contentious and the utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> He is far distant. Restore to Him, therefore, a spirit sound as you received it. For when you have given to a fuller a new garment, and desire to receive it back entire at the end, if, then, the fuller return you a torn garment, will you take it from him, and not rather be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and abuse him, saying, 'I gave you a garment that was entire: why have you rent it, and made it useless, so that it can be of no use on account of the rent which you have made in it?' Would you not say all this to the fuller about the rent which you found in your garment? If, therefore, you grieve about your garment, and complain because you have not received it entire, what do you think the Lord will do to you, who gave you a sound spirit, which you have rendered altogether useless, so that it can be of no service to its possessor? For its use began to be unprofitable, seeing it was corrupted by you. Will not the Lord, therefore, because of this conduct of yours regarding His Spirit, act in the same way, and deliver you over to death? Assuredly, I say, he will do the same to all those whom He shall find retaining a recollection of offenses.  Do not trample His mercy under foot, He says, but rather <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him, because He is so patient with your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is not as you are. Repent, for it is useful to you.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 33</h3>

<p><q>All these things which are written above, I, the Shepherd, the messenger of repentance, have showed and spoken to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  If therefore you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and listen to my words, and walk in them, and amend your ways, you shall have it in your power to live: but if you remain in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and in the recollection of offenses, no sinner of that class will live unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All these words which I had to say have been spoken unto you.</q></p>

<p>The Shepherd said to me, <q>Have you asked me everything?</q> And I replied, <q>Yes, sir.</q> <q>Why did you not ask me about the shape of the stones that were put into the building, that I might explain to you why we filled up the shapes?</q> And I said, <q>I forgot, sir.</q> <q>Hear now, then,</q> he said, <q>about this also. These are they who have now heard my commandments, and repented with their whole hearts. And when the Lord saw that their repentance was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and pure, and that they were able to remain in it, He ordered their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be blotted out.  For these shapes were their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and they were levelled down, that they might not appear.</q></p>

<h2>Similitude 10</h2>

<p><strong>Concerning Repentance and Alms-Giving.</strong></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>After I had fully written down this book, that messenger who had delivered me to the Shepherd came into the house in which I was, and sat down upon a couch, and the Shepherd stood on his right hand. He then called me, and spoke to me as follows: <q>I have delivered you and your house to the Shepherd, that you may be protected by him.</q> <q>Yes, sir,</q> I said. <q>If you wish, therefore, to be protected,</q> he said, <q>from all annoyance, and from all harsh treatment, and to have success in every good work and word, and to possess all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of righteousness, walk in these commandments which he has given you, and you will be able to subdue all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For if you keep those commandments, every desire and pleasure of the world will be subject to you, and success will attend you in every good work. Take unto yourself his experience and moderation, and say to all that he is in great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dignity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that he is a president with great power, and mighty in his office. To him alone throughout the whole world is the power of repentance assigned. Does he seem to you to be powerful? But you despise his experience, and the moderation which he exercises towards you.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>I said to him, <q>Ask himself, sir, whether from the time that he has entered my house I have done anything improper, or have offended him in any respect.</q> He answered, <q>I also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you neither have done nor will do anything improper, and therefore I speak these words to you, that you may persevere. For he had a good report of you to me, and you will say these words to others, that they also who have either repented or will still repent may entertain the same feelings with you, and he may report well of these to me, and I to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> And I said, <q>Sir, I make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every man the great works of God: and I hope that all those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them, and have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before, on hearing these words, may repent, and receive life again.</q> <q>Continue, therefore, in this ministry, and finish it. And all who follow out his commands shall have life, and great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with the Lord.  But those who do not keep his commandments, flee from his life, and despise him. But he has his own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with the Lord. All, therefore, who shall despise him,  and not follow his commands, deliver themselves to death, and every one of them will be guilty of his own blood. But I enjoin you, that you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his commands, and you will have a cure for your former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q></p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p><q>Moreover, I sent you these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, that they may dwell with you.  For I saw that they were courteous to you. You will therefore have them as assistants, that you may be the better able to keep his commands: for it is impossible that these commandments can be observed without these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. I see, moreover, that they abide with you willingly; but I will also instruct them not to depart at all from your house: do you only keep your house pure, as they will delight to dwell in a pure abode. For they are pure, and chaste, and industrious, and have all influence with the Lord. Therefore, if they find your house to be pure, they will remain with you; but if any defilement, even a little, befall it, they will immediately withdraw from your house. For these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> do not at all like any defilement.</q> I said to him, <q>I hope, sir, that I will please them, so that they may always be willing to inhabit my house. And as he to whom you entrusted me has no complaint against me, so neither will they have.</q> He said to the Shepherd, <q>I see that the servant of God wishes to live, and to keep these commandments, and will place these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in a pure habitation.</q>  When he had spoken these words he again delivered me to the Shepherd, and called those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and said to them, <q>Since I see that you are willing to dwell in his house, I commend him and his house to you, asking that you withdraw not at all from it.</q> And the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> heard these words with pleasure.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>  then said to me, <q>Conduct yourself manfully in this service, and make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every one the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and you will have favour in this ministry. Whoever, therefore, shall walk in these commandments, shall have life, and will be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in his life; but whosoever shall neglect them shall not have life, and will be unhappy in this life. Enjoin all, who are able to act rightly, not to cease well-doing; for, to practice good works is useful to them.  And I say that every man ought to be saved from inconveniences. For both he who is in want, and he who suffers inconveniences in his daily life, is in great torture and necessity. Whoever, therefore, rescues a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this kind from necessity, will gain for himself great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For he who is harassed by inconveniences of this kind, suffers equal torture with him who is in chains. Moreover many, on account of calamities of this sort, when they could not endure them, hasten their own deaths. Whoever, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a calamity of this kind afflicting a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and does not save him, commits a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and becomes guilty of his blood.  Do good works, therefore, you who have received good from the Lord; lest, while you delay to do them, the building of the tower be finished, and you be rejected from the edifice: there is now no other tower a-building. For on your account was the work of building suspended. Unless, then, you make haste to do rightly, the tower will be completed, and you will be excluded.</q></p>

<p>After he had spoken with me he rose up from the couch, and taking the Shepherd and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, he departed. But he said to me that he would send back the Shepherd and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to my dwelling. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
