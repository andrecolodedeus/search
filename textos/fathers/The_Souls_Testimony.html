<h1>The Soul's Testimony</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>If, with the object of convicting the rivals and persecutors of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from their own authorities, of the crime of at once being untrue to themselves and doing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to us, one is bent on gathering testimonies in its favour from the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or the poets, or other masters of this world's learning and wisdom, he has need of a most inquisitive spirit, and a still greater memory to carry out the research. Indeed, some of our people, who still continued their inquisitive labours in ancient literature, and still occupied memory with it, have published works we have in our hands of this very sort; works in which they relate and attest the nature and origin of their traditions, and the grounds on which opinions rest, and from which it may be seen at once that we have embraced nothing new or monstrous&mdash; nothing for which we cannot claim the support of ordinary and well-known writings, whether in ejecting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from our creed, or admitting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into it. But the unbelieving hardness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart leads them to slight even their own teachers, otherwise approved and in high renown, whenever they touch upon arguments which are used in defence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Then the poets are fools, when they describe the gods with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and stories; then the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are without reason, when they knock at the gates of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He will thus far be reckoned a wise and sagacious man who has gone the length of uttering sentiments that are almost <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; while if, in a mere affectation of judgment and wisdom, he sets himself to reject their ceremonies, or to convicting the world of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is sure to be branded as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. We will have nothing, then, to do with the literature and the teaching, perverted in its best results, which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> rather than its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. We shall lay no stress on it, if some of their authors have declared that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one God only. Nay, let it be granted that there is nothing in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> writers which a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> approves, that it may be put out of his power to utter a single word of reproach. For all are not familiar with their teachings; and those who are, have no assurance in regard to their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Far less do men assent to our writings, to which no one comes for guidance unless he is already a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. I call in a new testimony, yea, one which is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than all literature, more discussed than all doctrine, more public than all publications, greater than the whole man&mdash; I mean all which is man's. Stand forth, O <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether you are a divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> substance, as most <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> if it be so, you will be the less likely to lie,&mdash; or whether you are the very opposite of divine, because indeed a mortal thing, as <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> alone thinks&mdash; in that case there will be the less <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> for you to speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in this case: whether you are received from heaven, or sprung from earth; whether you are formed of numbers, or of atoms; whether your <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> begins with that of the body, or you are put into it at a later stage; from whatever source, and in whatever way, you make man a rational being, in the highest degree capable of thought and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>&mdash;stand forth and give your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. But I call you not as when, fashioned in schools, trained in <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, fed in Attic academies and porticoes, you belch wisdom. I address you simple, rude, uncultured and untaught, such as they have you who have you only; that very thing of the road, the street, the work-shop, wholly. I want your inexperience, since in your small experience no one feels any confidence. I demand of you the things you bring with you into man, which you know either from yourself, or from your author, whoever he may be. You are not, as I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; for a man becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he is not born one. Yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> earnestly press you for a testimony; they press you, though an alien, to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against your friends, that they may be put to shame before you, for hating and mocking us on account of things which convict you as an accessory.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>We give offense by proclaiming that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, to whom the name of God alone belongs, from whom all things come, and who is Lord of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.  Bear you testimony, if you know this to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for openly and with a perfect liberty, such as we do not possess, we hear you both in private and in public exclaim, <q>Which may God grant,</q> and, <q>If God so will.</q> By expressions such as these you declare that there is one who is distinctively <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you confess that all power belongs to him to whose will, as Sovereign, you look. At the same time, too, you deny any others to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gods, in calling them by their own names of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Minerva; for you affirm Him to be God alone to whom you give no other name than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and though you sometimes call these others gods, you plainly use the designation as one which does not really belong to them, but is, so to speak, a borrowed one. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the God we declare unknown to you: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, God does good,</q> you are wont to say; plainly suggesting further, <q>But man is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> In asserting an antithetic proposition, you, in a sort of indirect and figurative way, reproachest man with his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in departing from a God so good. So, again, as among us, as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of benignity and goodness, <q>Blessing</q> is a most sacred act in our religion and our life, you too sayest as readily as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> needs, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bless you;</q> and when you turn the blessing of God into a curse, in like manner your very words confess with us that His power over us is absolute and entire. There are some who, though they do not deny the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hold withal that He is neither Searcher, nor Ruler, nor Judge; treating with special disdain those of us who go over to Christ out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a coming judgment, as they think, honouring God in freeing Him from the cares of keeping watch, and the trouble of taking note&mdash;not even regarding Him as capable of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they say, gets <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, then He is susceptible of corruption and passion; but that of which passion and corruption can be affirmed may also perish, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do. But these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> elsewhere, confessing that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is divine, and bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stumble against a testimony of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, which affords an answer to these views. For if either divine or God-given, it doubtless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its giver; and if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, it undoubtedly fears Him too, and especially as having been by Him endowed so amply. Has it no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Him whose favour it is so desirous to possess, and whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> it is so anxious to avoid? Whence, then, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> natural <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if God cannot be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>? How is there any dread of Him whom nothing offends? What is feared but <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? Whence comes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but from observing what is done? What leads to watchful oversight, but judgment in prospect? Whence is judgment, but from power? To whom does supreme authority and power belong, but to God alone? So you are always ready, O <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from your own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nobody casting scorn upon you, and no one preventing, to exclaim, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all,</q> and <q>I commend you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and <q>May God repay,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall judge between us.</q> How happens this, since you are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? How is it that, even with the garland of Ceres on the brow, wrapped in the purple cloak of Saturn, wearing the white robe of the goddess Isis, you invoke God as judge? Standing under the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of &AElig;sculapius, adorning the brazen image of Juno, arraying the helmet of Minerva with dusky figures, you never think of appealing to any of these deities. In your own forum you appeal to a God who is elsewhere; you permit <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be rendered in your temples to a foreign god. Oh, striking testimony to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which in the very midst of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> obtains a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>But when we say that there are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>&mdash; as though, in the simple fact that we alone expel them from the men's bodies,  we did not also prove their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>&mdash; some <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Chrysippus begins to curl the lip. Yet your curses sufficiently attest that there are such beings, and that they are objects of your strong dislike.  As what comes to you as a fit expression of your strong <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of him, you call the man a d&aelig;mon who annoys you with his filthiness, or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, or insolence, or any other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which we ascribe to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>. In expressing vexation, contempt, or abhorrence, you have <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> constantly upon your lips;  the very same we hold to be the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the source of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the corrupter of the whole world, by whom in the beginning man was entrapped into breaking the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And (the man) being given over to death on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, tainted in their descent from him, were made a channel for transmitting his condemnation. You see, then, your destroyer; and though he is fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or to whatever <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>  confesses the Lord, yet, even you have some acquaintance with him while yet you abhor him!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Even now, as the matter refers to your opinion on a point the more closely belonging to you, in so far as it bears on your personal well-being, we maintain that after life has passed away you still remain in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and look forward to a day of judgment, and according to your deserts art assigned to misery or bliss, in either way of it for ever; that, to be capable of this, your former substance must needs return to you, the matter and the memory of the very same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being: for neither good nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could you feel if you were not endowed again with that sensitive bodily organization, and there would be no grounds for judgment without the presentation of the very person to whom the sufferings of judgment were due. That <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> view, though much nobler than the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, as it does not transfer you into beasts; though more complete than the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>, since it endows you again with a body; though more worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than the Epicurean, as it preserves you from annihilation&mdash;yet, because of the name connected with it, it is held to be nothing but vanity and folly, and, as it is called, a mere presumption. But we are not ashamed of ourselves if our presumption is found to have your support. Well, in the first place, when you speak of one who is dead, you say of him, <q>Poor man</q>&mdash; poor, surely, not because he has been taken from the good of life, but because he has been given over to punishment and condemnation. But at another time you speak of the dead as free from trouble; you profess to think life a burden, and death a blessing. You are wont, too, to speak of the dead as in repose,  when, returning to their graves beyond the city gates  with food and dainties, you are wont to present offerings to yourself rather than to them; or when, coming from the graves again, you are staggering under the effects of wine. But I want your sober opinion. You call the dead poor when you speak your own thoughts, when you are at a distance from them. For at their feast, where in a sense they are present and recline along with you, it would never do to cast reproach upon their lot. You can not but adulate those for whose sake you are feasting it so sumptuously. Do you then speak of him as <em>poor</em> who feels not? How happens it that you curse as one capable of suffering from your curse, the man whose memory comes back on you with the sting in it of some old injury? It is your imprecation that <q>the earth may lie heavy on him,</q> and that there may be trouble <q>to his ashes in the realm of the dead.</q> In like manner, in your kindly feeling to him to whom you are indebted for favours, you entreat <q>repose to his bones and ashes,</q> and your desire is that among the dead he may <q>have pleasant rest.</q> If you have no power of suffering after death, if no feeling remains&mdash;if, in a word, severance from the body is the annihilation of you, what makes you lie against yourself, as if you could suffer in another state? Nay, why do you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death at all? There is nothing after death to be feared, if there is nothing to be felt. For though it may be said that death is dreadful not for anything it threatens afterwards, but because it deprives us of the good of life; yet, on the other hand, as it puts an end to life's discomforts, which are far more numerous, death's terrors are mitigated by a gain that more than outweighs the loss. And there is no occasion to be troubled about a loss of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which is amply made up for by so great a blessing as relief from every trouble. There is nothing dreadful in that which delivers from all that is to be dreaded. If you shrink from giving up life because your experience of it has been sweet, at any rate there is no need to be in any alarm about death if you have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Your dread of it is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that you are aware of its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. You would never think it <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; you would have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it at all&mdash; if you were not sure that after it there is something to make it <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and so a thing of terror.  Let us leave unnoted at this time that natural way of fearing death. It is a poor thing for any one to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what is inevitable. I take up the other side, and argue on the ground of a joyful hope beyond our term of earthly life; for desire of posthumous fame is with almost every class an inborn thing.  I have not time to speak of the Curtii, and the Reguli, or the brave men of Greece, who afford us innumerable cases of death despised for after renown. Who at this day is without the desire that he may be often remembered when he is dead? Who does not give all endeavour to preserve his name by works of literature, or by the simple <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, or by the splendour even of his tomb? How is it the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to have these posthumous ambitions and with such amazing effort to prepare the things it can only use after decease? It would care nothing about the future, if the future were quite unknown to it. But perhaps you think yourself surer, after your exit from the body, of continuing still to feel, than of any future resurrection, which is a doctrine laid at our door as one of our presumptuous suppositions. But it is also the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for if any one inquires about a person lately dead as though he were alive, it occurs at once to say, <q>He has gone.</q> He is expected to return, then.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>These testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are simple as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, commonplace as simple, universal as commonplace, natural as universal, divine as natural. I don't think they can appear frivolous or feeble to any one, if he reflect on the majesty of nature, from which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> derives its authority.  If you acknowledge the authority of the mistress, you will own it also in the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. Well, nature is the mistress here, and her <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But everything the one has taught or the other learned, has come from God&mdash; the Teacher of the teacher. And what the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the teachings of its chief instructor, you can judge from that which is within you. Think of that which enables you to think; reflect on that which in forebodings is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the augur in omens, the foreseer of coming events. Is it a wonderful thing, if, being the gift of God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to divine? Is it anything very strange, if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the God by whom it was bestowed? Even fallen as it is, the victim of the great adversary's machinations, it does not forget its Creator, His goodness and law, and the final end both of itself and of its foe. Is it singular then, if, divine in its origin, its revelations agree with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> God has given to His own people? But he who does not regard those outbursts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the teaching of a congenital nature and the secret deposit of an inborn <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, will say that the habit and, so to say, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of speaking in this way has been acquired and confirmed from the opinions of published books widely spread among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Unquestionably the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before letters, and speech before books, and ideas before the writing of them, and man himself before the poet and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>.  Is it then to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that before literature and its publication no utterances of the sort we have pointed out came from the lips of men? Did nobody speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His goodness, nobody of death, nobody of the dead? Speech went a-begging, I suppose; nay, (the subjects being still awanting, without which it cannot even exist at this day, when it is so much more copious, and rich, and wise), it could not exist at all if the things which are now so easily suggested, that cling to us so constantly, that are so very near to us, that are somehow born on our very lips, had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in ancient times, before letters had any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the world&mdash; before there was a Mercury, I think, at all. And whence was it, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that letters themselves came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and to disseminate for the use of speech, what no mind had ever conceived, or tongue put forth, or ear taken in? But, clearly, since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether belonging to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, into whose olive tree we have been grafted&mdash; are much more ancient than any secular literature, (or, let us only say, are of a somewhat earlier date, as we have shown in its proper place when proving their trustworthiness); if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have taken these utterances from writings at all, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it has taken them from ours, and not from yours, its instruction coming more naturally from the earlier than the later works. Which latter indeed waited for their own instruction from the former, and though we grant that light has come from you, still it has flowed from the first fountainhead originally; and we claim as entirely ours, all you may have taken from us and handed down. Since it is thus, it matters little whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was put into it by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by His book. Why, then, O man, will you maintain a view so groundless, as that those testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have gone forth from the mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speculations of your literature, and got hardening of common use?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Believe, then, your own books, and as to our Scriptures so much the more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> writings which are divine, but in the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself give like confidence to Nature. Choose the one of these you observe to be the most faithful friend of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If your own writings are distrusted, neither God nor Nature lie. And if you would have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God and Nature, have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; thus you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> yourself. Certainly you value the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as giving you your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> greatness&mdash;that to which you belong; which is all things to you; without which you can neither live nor die; on whose account you even put God away from you. Since, then, you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before you, and put her to the question. Why does she worship another? Why name the name of God? Why does she speak of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, when she means to denote spirits to be held accursed? Why does she make her protestations towards the heavens, and pronounce her ordinary execrations earthwards? Why does she render service in one place, in another invoke the Avenger? Why does she pass judgments on the dead? What <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> phrases are those she has got, though <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> she neither desires to see nor hear? Why has she either bestowed them on us, or received them from us? Why has she either taught us them, or learned them as our scholar? Regard with suspicion this accordance in words, while there is such difference in practice. It is utter folly&mdash; denying a universal nature&mdash; to ascribe this exclusively to our language and the Greek, which are regarded among us as so near akin. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a boon from heaven to Latins and Greeks alone. Man is the one name belonging to every nation upon earth: there is one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and many tongues, one spirit and various sounds; every country has its own speech, but the subjects of speech are common to all. God is everywhere, and the goodness of God is everywhere; <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are everywhere, and the cursing of them is everywhere; the invocation of divine judgment is everywhere, death is everywhere, and the sense of death is everywhere, and all the world over is found the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. There is not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man that does not, from the light that is in itself, proclaim the very things we are not permitted to speak above our breath. Most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, then, every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a culprit as well as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: in the measure that it testifies for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the guilt of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> lies on it; and on the day of judgment it will stand before the courts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without a word to say. You proclaimed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but you did not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him: <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> were detested by you, and yet they were the objects of your adoration; the punishments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> were foreseen by you, but no care was taken to avoid them; you had a savour of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and withal were the persecutor of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>
