<h1>The Stromata (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Preface&mdash; The Author's Object&mdash; The Utility of Written Compositions. </h2>

<p>[<em>Wants the beginning</em>] . . . . . . . . . . that you may read them under your hand, and may be able to preserve them. Whether written compositions are not to be left behind at all; or if they are, by whom? And if the former, what need there is for written compositions? And if the latter, is the composition of them to be assigned to earnest men, or the opposite? It were certainly ridiculous for one to disapprove of the writing of earnest men, and approve of those, who are not such, engaging in the work of composition. Theopompus and Tim&aelig;us, who composed fables and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> the leader of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, and Hipponax and Archilochus, are to be allowed to write in their own shameful manner. But he who proclaims the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to be prevented from leaving behind him what is to benefit posterity. It is a good thing, I reckon, to leave to posterity good children. This is the case with children of our bodies. But words are the progeny of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence we call those who have instructed us, fathers. Wisdom is a communicative and philanthropic thing. Accordingly, Solomon says, <q>My son, if you receive the saying of my commandment, and hide it with you, your ear shall hear wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021798"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> He points out that the word that is sown is hidden in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the learner, as in the earth, and this is spiritual planting. Wherefore also he adds, <q>And you shall apply your heart to understanding, and apply it for the admonition of your son.</q> For <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, methinks, joined with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and spirit with spirit, in the sowing of the word, will make that which is sown grow and germinate. And every one who is instructed, is in respect of subjection the son of his instructor. <q>Son,</q> says he, <q>forget not my <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021799"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;3:1</a></span> </p>

<p>And if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belong not to all (set an ass to the lyre, as the proverb goes), yet written compositions are for the many. <q>Swine, for instance, delight in dirt more than in clean water.</q> <q>Wherefore,</q> says the Lord, <q>I speak to them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>: because seeing, they see not; and hearing, they hear not, and do not understand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021800"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;13:13</a></span> not as if the Lord caused the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: for it were impious to think so. But He <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> exposed this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in them, and intimated that they would not understand the things spoken. And now the Saviour shows Himself, out of His abundance, dispensing goods to His servants according to the ability of the recipient, that they may augment them by exercising activity, and then returning to reckon with them; when, approving of those that had increased His money, those faithful in little, and commanding them to have the charge over many things, He bade them enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the Lord. But to him who had hid the money, entrusted to him to be given out at interest, and had given it back as he had received it, without increase, He said, <q>You <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> servant, you ought to have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own.</q> Wherefore the useless servant <q>shall be cast into outer darkness.</q>  <q>You, therefore, be strong,</q> says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. And the things which you have heard of me among many witnesses, commit to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021802"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> And again: <q>Study to show yourself approved unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>If, then, both proclaim the Word&mdash; the one by writing, the other by speech&mdash; are not both then to be approved, making, as they do, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> active by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? It is by one's own fault that he does not choose what is best; God is free of blame. As to the point in hand, it is the business of some to lay out the word at interest, and of others to test it, and either choose it or not. And the judgment is determined within themselves. But there is that species of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is characteristic of the herald, and that which is, as it were, characteristic of a messenger, and it is serviceable in whatever way it operates, both by the hand and tongue. <q>For he that sows to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well-doing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021803"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;6:8-9</a></span> On him who by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> meets in with it, it confers the very highest advantages&mdash;the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, readiness for adopting a right mode of life, the impulse towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a movement of inquiry, a trace of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; in a word, it gives the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And those who have been rightly reared in the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and received provision for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, wing their way to heaven. Most admirably, therefore, the apostle says, <q>In everything approving ourselves as the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as poor, and yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things. Our mouth is opened to you.</q>  <q>I charge you,</q> he says, writing to Timothy, <q>before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Christ Jesus, and the elect <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that you observe these things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021805"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:21</a></span> </p>

<p>Both must therefore test themselves: the one, if he is qualified to speak and leave behind him written records; the other, if he is in a right state to hear and read: as also some in the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, according to  custom enjoin that each one of the people individually should take his part. One's own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is best for choosing accurately or shunning. And its firm foundation is a right life, with suitable instruction. But the imitation of those who have already been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and who have led correct lives, is most excellent for the understanding and practice of the commandments. <q>So that whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021807"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27-28</a></span> It therefore follows, that every one of those who undertake to promote the good of their neighbours, ought to consider whether he has betaken himself to teaching rashly and out of rivalry to any; if his communication of the word is out of vainglory; if the the only reward he reaps is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who hear, and if he speaks not in order to win favour: if so, he who speaks by writings escapes the reproach of mercenary motives. <q>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>nor a cloak of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. God is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Nor of men sought we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children.</q> </p>

<p>In the same way, therefore, those who take part in the divine words, ought to guard against betaking themselves to this, as they would to the building of cities, to examine them out of curiosity; that they do not come to the task for the sake of receiving worldly things, having ascertained that they who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Christ are given to communicate the necessaries of life. But let such be dismissed as hypocrites. But if any one wishes not to seem, but to be righteous, to him it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which are best. If, then, <q>the harvest is plenteous, but the labourers few,</q> it is incumbent on us <q>to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a></q> that there may be as great abundance of labourers as possible. <span class="stiki" id="note021809"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;9:37-38</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;10:2</a></span> </p>

<p>But the husbandry is twofold,&mdash; the one unwritten, and the other written. And in whatever way the Lord's labourer sow the good wheat, and grow and reap the ears, he shall appear a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine husbandman. <q>Labour,</q> says the Lord, <q>not for the meat which perishes, but for that which endures to everlasting life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021810"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> And nutriment is received both by bread and by words. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>blessed are the peace-makers,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021811"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> who instructing those who are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in their life and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> here, lead them back to the peace which is in the Word, and nourish for the life which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the distribution of the bread, those <q>that hunger after righteousness.</q> For each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has its own proper nutriment; some growing by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and science, and others feeding on the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the whole of which, like nuts, is not eatable. <q>And he that plants and he that waters,</q> <q>being ministers</q> of Him <q>that gives the increase, are one</q> in the ministry. <q>But every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own work. For we are God's husbandmen, God's husbandry. You are God's building,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021812"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8-9</a></span> according to the apostle. Wherefore the hearers are not permitted to apply the test of comparison. Nor is the word, given for investigation, to be committed to those who have been reared in the arts of all kinds of words, and in the power of inflated attempts at <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; whose minds are already pre-occupied, and have not been previously emptied. But whoever chooses to banquet on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is steadfast for the reception of the divine words, having acquired already <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a power of judging, according to reason. Hence ensues to him persuasion in abundance. And this was the meaning of that saying of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, neither shall you understand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021813"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> <q>As, then, we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021814"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> And let each of these, according to the blessed David, sing, giving thanks. <q>You shall sprinkle me with <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, and I shall be cleansed. You shall wash me, and I shall be whiter than the snow. You shall make me to hear <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the bones which have been humbled shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Turn Your face from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Blot out mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. Cast me not away from Your face, and take not Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from me. Restore to me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and establish me with Your princely spirit.</q> </p>

<p>He who addresses those who are present before him, both tests them by time, and judges by his judgment, and from the others distinguishes him who can hear; watching the words, the manners, the habits, the life, the motions, the attitudes, the look, the voice; the road, the rock, the beaten path, the fruitful land, the wooded region, the fertile and fair and cultivated spot, that is able to multiply the seed. But he that speaks through books, consecrates himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, crying in writing thus: Not for gain, not for vainglory, not to be vanquished by partiality, nor enslaved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> nor elated by pleasure; but only to reap the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who read, which he does, not at present participate in, but awaiting in expectation the recompense which will certainly be rendered by Him, who has promised to bestow on the labourers the reward that is meet. But he who is enrolled in the number of men  ought not to desire recompense. For he that vaunts his good services, receives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as his reward. And he who does any duty for the sake of recompense, is he not held fast in the custom of the world, either as one who has done well, hastening to receive a reward, or as an evil-doer avoiding retribution? We must, as far as we can, imitate the Lord. And he will do so, who complies with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receiving freely, giving freely, and receiving as a worthy reward the citizenship itself. <q>The hire of an harlot shall not come into the sanctuary,</q> it is said: accordingly it was forbidden to bring to the altar the price of a dog. And in whomsoever the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been blinded by ill-nurture and teaching, let him advance to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which shows by writing the things that are unwritten. <q>You that thirst, go to the waters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021817"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;55:1</a></span> says Esaias. And <q>drink water from your own vessels,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021818"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;5:15</a></span> Solomon exhorts. Accordingly in <q>The Laws,</q> the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who learned from the Hebrews, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, commands husbandmen not to irrigate or take water from others, until they have first dug down in their own ground to what is called the virgin soil, and found it dry. For it is right to supply want, but it is not well to support laziness. For Pythagoras said that, <q>although it be agreeable to reason to take a share of a burden, it is not a duty to take it away.</q></p>

<p>Now the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> kindles the living spark of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and directs the eye suitably for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; perchance inserting something, as the husbandman when he ingrafts, but, according to the opinion of the divine apostle, exciting what is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>For there are certainly among us many weak and sickly, and many sleep. But if we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged.</q>  Now this work of mine in writing is not artfully constructed for display; but my memoranda are stored up against old age, as a remedy against forgetfulness, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> an image and outline of those vigorous and animated discourses which I was privileged to hear, and of blessed and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> remarkable men.</p>

<p>Of these the one, in Greece, an Ionic;  the other in Magna Gr&aelig;cia: the first of these from C&oelig;le-<a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the second from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and others in the East. The one was born in the land of Assyria, and the other a Hebrew in Palestine.</p>

<p>When I came upon the last  (he was the first in power), having tracked him out concealed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, I found rest. He, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Sicilian bee, gathering the spoil of the flowers of the prophetic and apostolic meadow, engendered in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of his hearers a deathless element of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>Well, they preserving the tradition of the blessed doctrine derived directly from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Peter, James, John, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the sons receiving it from the father (but few were like the fathers), came by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to us also to deposit those ancestral and apostolic seeds. And well I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they will exult; I do not mean delighted with this tribute, but solely on account of the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according as they delivered it. For such a sketch as this, will, I think, be agreeable to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desirous of preserving from escape the blessed tradition.  <q>In a man who loves wisdom the father will be glad.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021823"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;29:3</a></span> Wells, when pumped out, yield purer water; and that of which no one partakes, turns to putrefaction. Use keeps steel brighter, but disuse produces rust in it. For, in a word, exercise produces a healthy condition both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies. <q>No one lights a candle, and puts it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may give light to those who are regarded worthy of the feast.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021824"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;5:15</a>; <a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;4:21</a></span> For what is the use of wisdom, if it makes not him who can hear it wise? For still the Saviour saves, <q>and always works, as He sees the Father.</q>  For by teaching, one learns more; and in speaking, one is often a hearer along with his audience. For the teacher of him who speaks and of him who hears is one&mdash; who waters both the mind and the word. Thus the Lord did not hinder from doing good while keeping the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>;  but allowed us to communicate of those divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light, to those who are able to receive them. He did not certainly disclose to the many what did not belong to the many; but to the few to whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they belonged, who were capable of receiving and being moulded according to them. But secret things are entrusted to speech, not to writing, as is the case with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>And if one say that it is written, <q>There is nothing secret which shall not be revealed, nor hidden which shall not be disclosed,</q>  let him also hear from us, that to him who hears secretly, even what is secret shall be manifested. This is what was predicted by this oracle. And to him who is able secretly to observe what is delivered to him, that which is veiled shall be disclosed as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and what is hidden to the many, shall appear manifest to the few. For why do not all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Why is not righteousness loved, if righteousness belongs to all? But the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are delivered <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, that what is spoken may be in the mouth of the speaker; rather not in his voice, but in his understanding. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, some <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021829"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;4:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>The writing of these memoranda of mine, I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is weak when compared with that spirit, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which I was privileged to hear.  But it will be an image to recall the archetype to him who was struck with the thyrsus. For <q>speak,</q> it is said, <q>to a wise man, and he will grow wiser; and to him that has, and there shall be added to him.</q> And we profess not to explain secret things sufficiently&mdash; far from it&mdash; but only to recall them to memory, whether we have forgot anything, or whether for the purpose of not forgetting. Many things, I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, have escaped us, through length of time, that have dropped away unwritten. Whence, to aid the weakness of my memory, and provide for myself a salutary help to my recollection in a systematic arrangement of chapters, I necessarily make use of this form. There are then some things of which we have no recollection; for the power that was in the blessed men was great.  There are also some things which remained unnoted long, which have now escaped; and others which are effaced, having faded away in the mind itself, since such a task is not easy to those not experienced; these I revive in my commentaries. Some things I purposely omit, in the exercise of a wise selection, afraid to write what I guarded against speaking: not grudging&mdash; for that were wrong&mdash; but fearing for my readers, lest they should stumble by taking them in a wrong sense; and, as the proverb says, we should be found <q>reaching a sword to a child.</q> For it is impossible that what has been written should not escape, although remaining unpublished by me. But being always revolved, using the one only voice, that of writing, they answer nothing to him that makes inquiries beyond what is written; for they require of necessity the aid of some one, either of him who wrote, or of some one else who has walked in his footsteps. Some things my treatise will hint; on some it will linger; some it will merely mention. It will try to speak imperceptibly, to exhibit secretly, and to demonstrate silently. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> taught by remarkable <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> will be adduced; and to these will be opposed all that ought to be premised in accordance with the profoundest <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which, as we proceed to the renowned and venerable canon of tradition, from the creation of the world,  will advance to our view; setting before us what according to natural <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> necessarily has to be treated of beforehand, and clearing off what stands in the way of this arrangement. So that we may have our ears ready for the reception of the tradition of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; the soil being previously cleared of the thorns and of every weed by the husbandman, in order to the planting of the vine. For there is a contest, and the prelude to the contest; and there are some <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> before other <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</p>

<p>Our book will not shrink from making use of what is best in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and other preparatory instruction. <q>For not only for the Hebrews and those that are under the law,</q> according to the apostle, <q>is it right to become a Jew, but also a Greek for the sake of the Greeks, that we may gain all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021833"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:20-21</a></span> Also in the Epistle to the Colossians he writes, <q>Admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021834"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse28">Colossians&nbsp;1:28</a></span> The nicety of speculation, too, suits the sketch presented in my commentaries. In this respect the resources of learning are like a relish mixed with the food of an athlete, who is not indulging in luxury, but entertains a noble desire for distinction.</p>

<p>By music we harmoniously relax the excessive tension of gravity. And as those who wish to address the people, do so often by the herald, that what is said may be better heard; so also in this case. For we have the word, that was spoken to many, before the common tradition. Wherefore we must set forth the opinions and utterances which cried individually to them, by which those who hear shall more readily turn.</p>

<p>And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to speak briefly: Among many small pearls there is the one; and in a great take of fish there is the beauty-fish; and by time and toil <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will gleam forth, if a good helper is at hand. For most benefits are supplied, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through men. All of us who make use of our eyes see what is presented before them. But some look at objects for one reason, others for another. For instance, the cook and the shepherd do not survey the sheep similarly: for the one examines it if it be fat; the other watches to see if it be of good breed. Let a man milk the sheep's milk if he need sustenance: let him shear the wool if he need clothing. And in this way let me produce the fruit of the Greek erudition. </p>

<p>For I do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that any composition can be so fortunate as that no one will speak against it. But that is to be regarded as in accordance with reason, which nobody speaks against, with reason. And that course of action and choice is to be approved, not which is faultless, but which no one rationally finds fault with. For it does not follow, that if a man accomplishes anything not purposely, he does it through force of circumstances. But he will do it, managing it by wisdom divinely given, and in accommodation to circumstances. For it is not he who has <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that needs the way to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, any more than he, that is strong, needs recovery. For, like farmers who irrigate the land beforehand, so we also water with the liquid stream of Greek learning what in it is earthy; so that it may receive the spiritual seed cast into it, and may be capable of easily nourishing it. The <em>Stromata</em> will contain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> mixed up in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, or rather covered over and hidden, as the edible part of the nut in the shell. For, in my opinion, it is fitting that the seeds of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be kept for the husbandmen of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and no others. I am not oblivious of what is babbled by some, who in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> are frightened at every noise, and say that we ought to occupy ourselves with what is most necessary, and which contains the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and that we should pass over what is beyond and superfluous, which wears out and detains us to no purpose, in things which conduce nothing to the great end. Others think that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was introduced into life by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence, for the ruin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inventor. But I shall show, throughout the whole of these <em>Stromata</em>, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature, and can never turn out the producer of anything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; indicating that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is in a sense a work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Objection to the Number of Extracts from Philosophical Writings in These Books Anticipated and Answered</h2>

<p>In reference to these commentaries, which contain as the exigencies of the case demand, the Hellenic opinions, I say thus much to those who are fond of finding fault. First, even if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were useless, if the demonstration of its uselessness does good, it is yet useful. Then those cannot condemn the Greeks, who have only a mere hearsay <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their opinions, and have not entered into a minute investigation in each department, in order to acquaintance with them. For the refutation, which is based on experience, is entirely trustworthy. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is condemned is found the most complete demonstration. Many things, then, though not contributing to the final result, equip the artist. And otherwise erudition commends him, who sets forth the most essential doctrines so as to produce persuasion in his hearers, engendering admiration in those who are taught, and leads them to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And such persuasion is convincing, by which those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> learning admit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not ruin life by being the originator of false practices and base <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, although some have <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> it, though it be the clear image of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a divine gift to the Greeks;  nor does it drag us away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as if we were bewitched by some delusive art, but rather, so to speak, by the use of an ampler circuit, obtains a common exercise demonstrative of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Further, the juxtaposition of doctrines, by comparison, saves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from which follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>Philosophy came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, not on its own account, but for the advantages reaped by us from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, we receiving a firm persuasion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> perception, through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things comprehended by the mind. For I do not mention that the <em>Stromata</em>, forming a body of varied erudition, wish artfully to conceal the seeds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. As, then, he who is fond of hunting captures the game after seeking, tracking, scenting, hunting it down with dogs; so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when sought and got with toil, appears a delicious  thing. Why, then, you will ask, did you think it fit that such an arrangement should be adopted in your memoranda? Because there is great danger in divulging the secret of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to those, whose delight it is unsparingly to speak against everything, not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>; and who shout forth all kinds of names and words indecorously, deceiving themselves and beguiling those who adhere to them. <q>For the Hebrews seek signs,</q> as the apostle says, <q>and the Greeks seek after wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021839"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Against the Sophists</h2>

<p>There is a great crowd of this description: some of them, enslaved to pleasures and willing to disbelieve, laugh at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is worthy of all reverence, making sport of its barbarousness. Some others, exalting themselves, endeavour to discover <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> objections to our words, furnishing captious questions, hunters out of paltry sayings, practicers of miserable artifices, wranglers, dealers in knotty points, as that Abderite says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For mortals' tongues are glib, and on them are many speeches; <br>And a wide range for words of all sorts in this place and that.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Of whatever sort the word you have spoken, of the same sort you must hear.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Inflated with this art of theirs, the wretched Sophists, babbling away in their own jargon; toiling their whole life about the division of names and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the composition and conjunction of sentences, show themselves greater chatterers than turtle-doves; scratching and tickling, not in a manly way, in my opinion, the ears of those who wish to be tickled.</p> <blockquote><p><q>A river of silly words&mdash; not a dropping;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>just as in old shoes, when all the rest is worn and is falling to pieces, and the tongue alone remains. The Athenian Solon most excellently enlarges, and writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Look to the tongue, and to the words of the glozing man, <br>But you look on no work that has been done; <br>But each one of you walks in the steps of a fox, <br>And in all of you is an empty mind.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>This, I think, is signified by the utterance of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <q>The foxes have holes, but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has not where to lay His head.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021840"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse58">Luke&nbsp;9:58</a></span> For on the believer alone, who is separated entirely from the rest, who by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> are called wild beasts, rests the head of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the kind and gentle Word, <q>who takes the wise in their own craftiness. For the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain;</q>  the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calling those the wise (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03C2;</span>) who are skilled in words and arts, sophists (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C2;</span>). Whence the Greeks also applied the denominative appellation of wise and sophists (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;, &#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;</span>) to those who were versed in anything Cratinus accordingly, having in the <em>Archilochii</em> enumerated the poets, said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Such a hive of sophists have you examined.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And similarly Iophon, the comic poet, in <em>Flute-playing Satyrs</em>, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For there entered <br>A band of sophists, all equipped.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Of these and the like, who devote their attention to empty words, the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> most excellently says, <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021842"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;29:14</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Human Arts as Well as Divine Knowledge Proceed from God</h2>

<p>Homer calls an artificer wise; and of Margites, if that is his work, he thus writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Him, then, the Gods made neither a delver nor a ploughman, <br>Nor in any other respect wise; but he missed every art.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Hesiod further said the musician Linus was <q>skilled in all manner of wisdom;</q> and does not hesitate to call a mariner wise, seeing he writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Having no wisdom in navigation.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which the king asks, it is not in the power of the wise, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, the Gazarenes, to tell the king; but it is God in heaven who reveals it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021843"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;2:27-28</a></span> </p>

<p>Here he terms the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> wise. And that Scripture calls every secular science or art by the one name wisdom (there are other arts and sciences invented over and above by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason), and that artistic and skilful invention is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will be clear if we adduce the following statement: <q>And the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, See, I have called Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Or, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>; and I have filled him with the divine spirit of wisdom, and understanding, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to devise and to execute in all manner of work, to work gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and in working stone work, and in the art of working wood,</q> and even to <q>all works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021844"><a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;31:2-5</a></span> And then He adds the general reason, <q>And to every understanding heart I have given understanding;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021845"><a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;31:6</a></span> that is, to every one capable of acquiring it by pains and exercise. And again, it is written expressly in the name of the Lord: <q>And speak to all that are wise in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whom I have filled with the spirit of perception.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021846"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;28:3</a></span> </p>

<p>Those who are wise in mind have a certain attribute of nature peculiar to themselves; and they who have shown themselves capable, receive from the Supreme Wisdom a spirit of perception in double measure. For those who practice the common arts, are in what pertains to the senses highly gifted: in hearing, he who is commonly called a musician; in touch, he who moulds clay; in voice the singer, in smell the perfumer, in sight the engraver of devices on seals. Those also that are occupied in instruction, train the sensibility according to which the poets are susceptible to the influence of measure; the sophists apprehend expression; the dialecticians, syllogisms; and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are capable of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of which themselves are the objects. For sensibility finds and invents; since it persuasively exhorts to application. And practice will increase the application which has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for its end. With reason, therefore, the apostle has called the wisdom of God <q>manifold,</q> and which has manifested its power <q>in many departments and in many modes</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021847"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;3:10</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> &mdash; by art, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash; for our benefit. <q>For all wisdom is from the Lord, and is with Him for ever,</q> as says the wisdom of Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note021848"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;1:1</a></span> </p>

<p>For if you call on wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with a loud voice, and seek it as treasures of silver, and eagerly track it out, you shall understand godliness and find divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note021849"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;2:3-5</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says this in contradiction to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which teaches us to investigate in a magnanimous and noble manner, for our progress in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He opposes, therefore, to it the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is occupied with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, when referring to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when he speaks as follows: <q>For God gives wisdom out of His own mouth, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> along with understanding, and treasures up help for the righteous.</q> For to those who have been justified  by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which leads to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is laid up as a help.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Philosophy the Handmaid of Theology</h2>

<p>Accordingly, before the advent of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was necessary to the Greeks for righteousness.  And now it becomes conducive to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; being a kind of preparatory training to those who attain to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through demonstration. <q>For your foot,</q> it is said, <q>will not stumble, if you refer what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whether belonging to the Greeks or to us, to Providence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021852"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;3:23</a></span> For God is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; but of some primarily, as of the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; and of others by consequence, as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Perchance, too, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was given to the Greeks directly and primarily, till the Lord should call the Greeks. For this was a schoolmaster to bring <q>the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> as the law, the Hebrews, <q>to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021853"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;3:24</a></span> Philosophy, therefore, was a preparation, paving the way for him who is perfected in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p><q>Now,</q> says Solomon, <q>defend wisdom, and it will exalt you, and it will shield you with a crown of pleasure.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021855"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;4:8-9</a></span> For when you have strengthened wisdom with a cope by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and with right expenditure, you will preserve it unassailable by sophists. The way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is therefore one. But into it, as into a perennial river, streams flow from all sides. It has been therefore said by inspiration: <q>Hear, my son, and receive my words; that yours may be the many ways of life. For I teach you the ways of wisdom; that the fountains fail you not,</q>  which gush forth from the earth itself. Not only did He enumerate several ways of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for any one righteous man, but He added many other ways of many righteous, speaking thus: <q>The paths of the righteous shine like the light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021857"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;4:18</a></span> The commandments and the modes of preparatory training are to be regarded as the ways and appliances of life.</p>

<p><q>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered your children, as a hen her chickens!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021858"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37</a>; <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;13:34</a></span> And Jerusalem is, when interpreted, <q>a vision of peace.</q> He therefore shows <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, that those who peacefully contemplate sacred things are in manifold ways trained to their calling. What then? He <q>would,</q> and could not. How often, and where? Twice; by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and by the advent. The expression, then, <q>How often,</q> shows wisdom to be manifold; every mode of quantity and quality, it by all means saves some, both in time and in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> fills the earth.</q>  And if any should violently say that the reference is to the Hellenic culture, when it is said, <q>Give not heed to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; for honey drops from the lips of a harlot,</q> let him hear what follows: <q>who lubricates your throat for the time.</q> But <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not flatter. Who, then, does He allude to as having committed fornication? He adds expressly, <q>For the feet of folly lead those who use her, after death, to Hades. But her steps are not supported.</q> Therefore remove your way far from silly pleasure. <q>Stand not at the doors of her house, that you yield not your life to others.</q> And He testifies, <q>Then shall you repent in old age, when the flesh of your body is consumed.</q> For this is the end of foolish pleasure. Such, indeed, is the case. And when He says, <q>Be not much with a strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q>  He admonishes us to use indeed, but not to linger and spend time with, secular culture. For what was bestowed on each generation advantageously, and at seasonable times, is a preliminary training for the word of the Lord. <q>For already some men, ensnared by the charms of handmaidens, have despised their consort <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and have grown old, some of them in music, some in geometry, others in grammar, the most in rhetoric.</q>  <q>But as the encyclical branches of study contribute to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which is their mistress; so also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself co-operates for the acquisition of wisdom. For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is the study of wisdom, and wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; and their causes.</q> Wisdom is therefore queen of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is of preparatory culture. For if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> <q>professes control of the tongue, and the belly, and the parts below the belly, it is to be chosen on its own account. But it appears more worthy of respect and pre-eminence, if cultivated for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And Scripture will afford a testimony to what has been said in what follows. Sarah was at one time barren, being <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> wife. Sarah having no child, assigned her maid, by name Hagar, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, in order to get children. Wisdom, therefore, who dwells with the man of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was reckoned faithful and righteous), was still barren and without child in that generation, not having brought forth to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> anything allied to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And she, as was proper, thought that he, being now in the time of progress, should have intercourse with secular culture first (by <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> the world is designated figuratively); and afterwards should approach to her according to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, and beget Isaac. </p>

<p>And Philo interprets Hagar to mean <q>sojourning.</q>  For it is said in connection with this, <q>Be not much with a strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q>  Sarah he interprets to mean <q>my princedom.</q> He, then, who has received previous training is at liberty to approach to wisdom, which is supreme, from which grows up the race of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. These things show that that wisdom can be acquired through instruction, to which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> attained, passing from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heavenly things to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness which are according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Isaac is shown to mean <q>self-taught;</q> wherefore also he is discovered to be a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He was the husband of one wife Rebecca, which they translate <q>Patience.</q> And Jacob is said to have consorted with several, his name being interpreted <q>Exerciser.</q> And exercises are engaged in by means of many and various <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. Whence, also, he who is really <q>endowed with the power of seeing</q> is called <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,  having much experience, and being fit for exercise.</p>

<p>Something else may also have been shown by the three patriarchs, namely, that the sure seal of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is composed of nature, of education, and exercise.</p>

<p>You may have also another image of what has been said, in Thamar sitting by the way, and presenting the appearance of a harlot, on whom the studious Judas (whose name is interpreted <q>powerful</q>), who left nothing unexamined and uninvestigated, looked; and turned aside to her, preserving his profession towards God. Wherefore also, when Sarah was jealous at Hagar being preferred to her, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as choosing only what was profitable in secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, said, <q>Behold, your maid is in your hands: deal with her as it pleases you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021867"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;16:6</a></span> manifestly meaning, <q>I embrace secular culture as youthful, and a handmaid; but your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and reverence as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wife.</q> And Sarah afflicted her; which is equivalent to corrected and admonished her. It has therefore been well said, <q>My son, despise not the correction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor faint when you are rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021868"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;3:11-12</a>; <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse5">Hebrews&nbsp;12:5-6</a></span> And the foresaid Scriptures, when examined in other places, will be seen to exhibit other <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. We merely therefore assert here, that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is characterized by investigation into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things (this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which the Lord Himself said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note021869"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span>); and that, again, the preparatory training for rest in Christ exercises the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, rouses the intelligence, and begets an inquiring shrewdness, by means of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which the initiated possess, having found it, or rather received it, from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Benefit of Culture</h2>

<p>The readiness acquired by previous training conduces much to the perception of such things as are requisite; but those things which can be perceived only by mind are the special exercise for the mind. And their nature is triple according as we consider their quantity, their magnitude, and what can be predicated of them. For the discourse which consists of demonstrations, implants in the spirit of him who follows it, clear <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so that he cannot conceive of that which is demonstrated being different; and so it does not allow us to succumb to those who assail us by fraud. In such studies, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is purged from sensible things, and is excited, so as to be able to see <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> distinctly. For nutriment, and the training which is maintained gentle, make noble natures; and noble natures, when they have received such training, become still better than before both in other respects, but especially in productiveness, as is the case with the other creatures. Wherefore it is said, <q>Go to the ant, you sluggard, and become wiser than it, which provides much and, varied food in the harvest against the inclemency of winter.</q>  Or go to the bee, and learn how laborious she is; for she, feeding on the whole meadow, produces one honey-comb. And if <q>you pray in the closet,</q> as the Lord taught, <q>to worship in spirit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021871"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;6:6</a>; <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;4:23</a></span> your management will no longer be solely occupied about the house, but also about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what must be bestowed on it, and how, and how much; and what must be laid aside and treasured up in it; and when it ought to be produced, and to whom. For it is not by nature, but by learning, that people become noble and good, as people also become physicians and pilots. We all in common, for example, see the vine and the horse. But the husbandman will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if the vine be good or bad at fruit-bearing; and the horseman will easily distinguish between the spiritless and the swift animal. But that some are naturally predisposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> above others, certain pursuits of those, who are so naturally predisposed above others, show. But that perfection in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not the exclusive property of those, whose natures are better, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, since also those who by nature are ill-disposed towards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in obtaining suitable training, for the most part attain to excellence; and, on the other hand, those whose natural dispositions are apt, become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through neglect.</p>

<p>Again, God has created us naturally social and just; whence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must not be said to take its rise from implantation alone. But the good imparted by creation is to be conceived of as excited by the commandment; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being trained to be willing to select what is noblest.</p>

<p>But as we say that a man can be a believer without learning,  so also we assert that it is impossible for a man without learning to comprehend the things which are declared in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But to adopt what is well said, and not to adopt the reverse, is caused not simply by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> combined with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is want of training and of instruction, then teaching produces <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. But just as it is possible to live rightly in penury of this world's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so also in abundance. And we avow, that at once with more ease and more speed will one attain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through previous training. But it is not such as to be unattainable without it; but it is attainable only when they have learned, and have had their senses exercised. <span class="stiki" id="note021873"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span> <q>For <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>,</q> says Solomon, <q>raises strife, but instruction guards the ways of life;</q>  in such a way that we are not deceived nor deluded by those who are practiced in base arts for the injury of those who hear. <q>But instruction wanders reproachless,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021875"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;10:19</a></span> it is said. We must be conversant with the art of reasoning, for the purpose of confuting the deceitful opinions of the sophists. Well and felicitously, therefore, does Anaxarchus write in his book respecting <q>kingly rule:</q> <q>Erudition benefits greatly and hurts greatly him who possesses it; it helps him who is worthy, and injures him who utters readily every word, and before the whole people. It is necessary to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the measure of time. For this is the end of wisdom. And those who sing at the doors, even if they sing skilfully, are not reckoned wise, but have the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of folly.</q> And Hesiod:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Of the Muses, who make a man loquacious, divine, vocal.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>  For him who is fluent in words he calls loquacious; and him who is clever, vocal; and <q>divine,</q> him who is skilled, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Eclectic Philosophy Paves the Way for Divine Virtue</h2>

<p>The Greek preparatory culture, therefore, with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, is shown to have come down from God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not with a definite direction but in the way in which showers fall down on the good land, and on the dunghill, and on the houses. And similarly both the grass and the wheat sprout; and the figs and any other reckless trees grow on sepulchres. And things that grow, appear as a type of truths. For they enjoy the same influence of the rain. But they have not the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as those which spring up in rich soil, inasmuch as they are withered or plucked up. And here we are aided by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the sower, which the Lord interpreted. For the husbandman of the soil which is among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is one; He who from the beginning, from the foundation of the world, sowed nutritious seeds; He who in each age rained down the Lord, the Word. But the times and places which received [such gifts], created the differences which exist. Further, the husbandman sows not only wheat (of which there are many varieties), but also other seeds&mdash; barley, and beans, and peas, and vetches, and vegetable and flower seeds. And to the same husbandry belongs both planting and the operations necessary in the nurseries, and gardens, and orchards, and the planning and rearing of all sorts of trees.</p>

<p>In like manner, not only the care of sheep, but the care of herds, and breeding of horses, and dogs, and bee-craft, all arts, and to speak comprehensively, the care of flocks and the rearing of animals, differ from each other more or less, but are all useful for life. And <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>&mdash; I do not mean the Stoic, or the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>, or the Epicurean, or the Aristotelian, but whatever has been well said by each of those <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which teach righteousness along with a science pervaded by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash;this eclectic whole I call <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.  But such conclusions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasonings, as men have cut away and falsified, I would never call divine.</p>

<p>And now we must look also at this, that if ever those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to do well, live well;  for they have lighted on well-doing. Some, too, have aimed well at the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through understanding. <q>But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was not justified by works, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021878"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm">Romans&nbsp;4</a></span> It is therefore of no advantage to them after the end of life, even if they do good works now, if they have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>  were translated into the language of the Greeks, in order that they might never be able to allege the excuse of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, inasmuch as they are able to hear also what we have in our hands, if they only wish. One speaks in one way of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in another way the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> interprets itself. The guessing at <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one thing, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself is another. Resemblance is one thing, the thing itself is another. And the one results from learning and practice, the other from power and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the teaching of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is a gift, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <q>For by doing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021880"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;7:17</a></span> <q>Open, then,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>the gates of righteousness; and I will enter in, and confess to the Lord .</q>  But the paths to righteousness (since God saves in many ways, for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>) are many and various, and lead to the Lord's way and gate. And if you ask the royal and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> entrance, you will hear, <q>This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter in by it.</q>  While there are many gates open, that in righteousness is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which all the blessed enter, and direct their steps in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now Clemens, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, while expounding the differences of those who are approved according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says expressly, <q>One may be a believer; one may be powerful in uttering <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; one may be wise in discriminating between words; one may be terrible in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Sophistical Arts Useless</h2>

<p>But the art of sophistry, which the Greeks cultivated, is a fantastic power, which makes false opinions like <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by means of words. For it produces rhetoric in order to persuasion, and disputation for wrangling. These arts, therefore, if not conjoined with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, will be injurious to every one. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> openly called sophistry <q>an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> art.</q> And Aristotle, following him, demonstrates it to be a dishonest art, which abstracts in a specious manner the whole business of wisdom, and professes a wisdom which it has not studied. To speak briefly, as the beginning of rhetoric is the probable, and an attempted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>  the process, and the end persuasion, so the beginning of disputation is what is matter of opinion, and the process a contest, and the end victory. For in the same manner, also, the beginning of sophistry is the apparent, and the process twofold; one of rhetoric, continuous and exhaustive; and the other of logic, and is interrogatory. And its end is admiration. The dialectic in vogue in the schools, on the other hand, is the exercise of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in matters of opinion, for the sake of the faculty of disputation. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in these at all. With reason, therefore, the noble apostle, depreciating these superfluous arts occupied about words, says, <q>If any man do not give heed to wholesome words, but is puffed up by a kind of teaching, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing, but doting (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span>) about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes contention, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, railings, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, destitute of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> </p>

<p>You see how he is moved against them, calling their art of logic&mdash; on which, those to whom this garrulous mischievous art is dear, whether Greeks or barbarians, plume themselves&mdash; a disease (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>). Very beautifully, therefore, the tragic poet Euripides says in the <em>Ph&oelig;niss&aelig;</em>&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>But a wrongful speech <br>Is diseased in itself, and needs skilful medicines.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>For the saving Word  is called <q>wholesome,</q> He being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and what is wholesome (healthful) remains ever deathless. But separation from what is healthful and divine is impiety, and a deadly malady. These are rapacious wolves hid in sheep-skins, men-stealers, and glozing soul-seducers, secretly, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; striving by fraud and force to catch us who are unsophisticated and have less power of speech.</p> <blockquote><p><q>Often a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, impeded through want of words, carries less weight <br>In expressing what is right, than the man of eloquence. <br>But now in fluent mouths the weightiest truths <br>They disguise, so that they do not seem what they ought to seem,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says the tragedy. Such are these wranglers, whether they follow the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, or practice miserable dialectic arts. These are they that <q>stretch the warp and weave nothing,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>;  prosecuting a bootless task, which the apostle has called <q>cunning craftiness of men whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021889"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> <q>For there are,</q> he says, <q>many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021890"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;1:10</a></span> Wherefore it was not said to all, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021891"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> For there are some even of the hearers of the word who are like the fishes of the sea, which, reared from their birth in brine, yet need <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> to dress them for food. Accordingly I wholly approve of the tragedy, when it says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O son, false words can be well spoken, <br>And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be vanquished by beauty of words. <br>But this is not what is most correct, but nature and what is right; <br>He who practices eloquence is indeed wise, <br>But I consider <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> always better than words.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>We must not, then, aspire to please the multitude. For we do not practice what will please them, but what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is remote from their disposition. <q>Let us not be desirous of vainglory,</q> says the apostle, <q>provoking one another, envying one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021892"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;5:26</a></span> </p>

<p>Thus the truth-loving <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, as if divinely inspired, <q>Since I am such as to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> nothing but the word, which, after reflection, appears to me the best.</q> </p>

<p>Accordingly he charges those who credit opinions without intelligence and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, with abandoning right and sound reason unwarrantably, and believing him who is a partner in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For to cheat one's self of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is bad; but to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to hold as our opinions positive realities, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<p>Men are deprived of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unwillingly. Nevertheless they are deprived either by being deceived or beguiled, or by being compelled and not believing. He who believes not, has already made himself a willing captive; and he who changes his persuasion is deceived, while he forgets that time imperceptibly takes away some things, and reason others. And after an opinion has been entertained, pain and anguish, and on the other hand contentiousness and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, compel. Above all, men are beguiled who are either bewitched by pleasure or terrified by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And all these are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> changes, but by none of these will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ever be attained.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Human Knowledge Necessary for the Understanding of the Scriptures</h2>

<p>Some, who think themselves naturally gifted, do not wish to touch either <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or logic; nay more, they do not wish to learn natural science. They demand bare <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, as if they wished, without bestowing any care on the vine, straightway to gather clusters from the first. Now the Lord is figuratively described as the vine, from which, with pains and the art of husbandry, according to the word, the fruit is to be gathered.</p>

<p>We must lop, dig, bind, and perform the other operations. The pruning-knife, I should think, and the pick-axe, and the other agricultural implements, are necessary for the culture of the vine, so that it may produce eatable fruit. And as in husbandry, so also in medicine: he has learned to purpose, who has practiced the various lessons, so as to be able to cultivate and to heal. So also here, I call him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> learned who brings everything to bear on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that, from geometry, and music, and grammar, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, culling what is useful, he guards the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against assault. Now, as was said, the athlete is despised who is not furnished for the contest. For instance, too, we praise the experienced helmsman who <q>has seen the cities of many men,</q> and the physician who has had large experience; thus also some describe the empiric.  And he who brings everything to bear on a right life, procuring examples from the Greeks and barbarians, this man is an experienced searcher after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in reality a man of much counsel, like the touch-stone (that is, the Lydian), which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to possess the power of distinguishing the spurious from the genuine gold. And our much-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> gnostic can distinguish sophistry from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the art of decoration from gymnastics, cookery from physic, and rhetoric from dialectics, and the other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which are according to the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. And how necessary is it for him who desires to be partaker of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to treat of intellectual subjects by philosophising! And how serviceable is it to distinguish expressions which are ambiguous, and which in the Testaments are used synonymously! For the Lord, at the time of His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, skilfully matched the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by an ambiguous expression. And I do not yet, in this connection, see how in the world the inventor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and dialectics, as some suppose, is seduced through being deceived by the form of speech which consists in ambiguity. And if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the arts by which the exercises of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are exhibited, yet the mind of the prophetic and instructive spirit, uttered secretly, because all have not an intelligent ear, demands skilful modes of teaching in order to clear exposition. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> infallibly their mind. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in a way which others could not easily, as the Spirit has said. But it is not possible for those who have not learned to receive it thus. <q>Write,</q> it is said, <q>the commandments doubly, in counsel and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that you may answer the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to them who send unto you.</q>  What, then, is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of answering? Or what that of asking? It is dialectics. What then? Is not speaking our business, and does not action proceed from the Word? For if we act not for the Word, we shall act against reason. But a rational work is accomplished through God. <q>And nothing,</q> it is said, <q>was made without Him</q>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note021896"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> </p>

<p>And did not the Lord make all things by the Word? Even the beasts work, driven by compelling <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And do not those who are called <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> apply themselves to good works, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not what they do?</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. To Act Well of Greater Consequence Than to Speak Well</h2>

<p>Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, taking the bread, first spoke and blessed. Then breaking the bread,  He presented it, that we might eat it, according to reason, and that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>  we might walk obediently. And as those whose speech is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are no better than those whose practice is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (for <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> is the servant of the sword, and evil-speaking inflicts pain; and from these proceed disasters in life, such being the effects of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speech); so also those who are given to good speech are near neighbours to those who accomplish good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Accordingly discourse refreshes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and entices it to nobleness; and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who has the use of both his hands. Neither, therefore, is he who can act well to be vilified by him who is able to speak well; nor is he who is able to speak well to be disparaged by him who is capable of acting well. But let each do that for which he is naturally fitted. What the one exhibits as actually done, the other speaks, preparing, as it were, the way for well-doing, and leading the hearers to the practice of good. For there is a saving word, as there is a saving work. Righteousness, accordingly,  is not constituted without discourse. And as the receiving of good is abolished if we abolish the doing of good; so <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are abolished when neither the command, nor one to expound the command, is taken along with us.  But now we are benefited mutually and reciprocally by words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; but we must repudiate entirely the art of wrangling and sophistry, since these sentences of the sophists not only bewitch and beguile the many, but sometimes by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> win a Cadmean victory.  For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> above all is that Psalm, <q>The just shall live to the end, for he shall not see corruption, when he beholds the wise dying.</q>  And whom does he call wise? Hear from the Wisdom of Jesus: <q>Wisdom is not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021903"><a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse22">Sirach&nbsp;19:22</a></span> Such he calls what the arts of speaking and of discussing have invented. <q>You shall therefore seek wisdom among the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and shall not find it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021904"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;14:6</a></span> And if you inquire again of what sort this is, you are told, <q>The mouth of the righteous man will distil wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021905"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse31">Proverbs&nbsp;10:31</a></span> And similarly with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the art of sophistry is called wisdom.</p>

<p>But it is my purpose, as I reckon, and not without reason, to live according to the Word, and to understand what is revealed;  but never affecting eloquence, to be content merely with indicating my meaning. And by what term that which I wish to present is shown, I care not. For I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to be saved, and to aid those who desire to be saved, is the best thing, and not to compose paltry sentences like gewgaws. <q>And if,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> in the <em>Politicus</em> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <q>you guard against solicitude about terms, you will be richer in wisdom against old age.</q>  And in the <em>The&oelig;tetus</em> you will find again, <q>And carelessness about names, and expressions, and the want of nice scrutiny, is not vulgar and illiberal for the most part, but rather the reverse of this, and is sometimes necessary.</q>  This the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>  has expressed with the greatest possible brevity, when it said, <q>Be not occupied much about words.</q> For expression is like the dress on the body. The matter is the flesh and sinews. We must not therefore care more for the dress than the safety of the body. For not only a simple mode of life, but also a style of speech devoid of superfluity and nicety, must be cultivated by him who has adopted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, if we are to abandon luxury as treacherous and profligate, as the ancient Laced&aelig;monians adjured ointment and purple, deeming and calling them rightly treacherous garments and treacherous ointments; since neither is that mode of preparing food right where there is more of seasoning than of nutriment; nor is that style of speech elegant which can please rather than benefit the hearers. Pythagoras exhorts us to consider the Muses more pleasant than the Sirens, teaching us to cultivate wisdom apart from pleasure, and exposing the other mode of attracting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as deceptive. For sailing past the Sirens one man has sufficient strength, and for answering the Sphinx another one, or, if you please, not even one.  We ought never, then, out of desire for vainglory, to make broad the phylacteries. It suffices the gnostic  if only one hearer is found for him.  You may hear therefore Pindar the B&oelig;otian,  who writes, <q>Divulge not before all the ancient speech. The way of silence is sometimes the surest. And the mightiest word is a spur to the fight.</q> Accordingly, the blessed apostle very appropriately and urgently exhorts us <q>not to strive about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers, but to shun profane and vain babblings, for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word will eat as does a canker.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. What is the Philosophy Which the Apostle Bids Us Shun?</h2>

<p>This, then, <q>the wisdom of the world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and of those who are <q>the wise the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> their thoughts that they are vain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021915"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:19-20</a></span> Let no man therefore <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on account of pre-eminence in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought. For it is written well in Jeremiah, <q>Let not the wise man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom, and let not the mighty man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his might, and let not the rich man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his riches: but let him that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this, that he understands and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that I am the Lord, that executes mercy and judgment and righteousness upon the earth: for in these things is my delight, says the Lord .</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021916"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:23-24</a></span> <q>That we should trust not in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,</q> says the apostle, <q>who delivered us from so great a death, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not stand in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>For the spiritual man judges all things, but he himself is judged of no man.</q>  I hear also those words of his, <q>And these things I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words, or one should enter in to spoil you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021918"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse4">Colossians&nbsp;2:4,&nbsp;8</a></span> And again, <q>Beware lest any man spoil you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021919"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> branding not all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but the Epicurean, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> mentions in the Acts of the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note021920"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;17:18</a></span> which abolishes <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and deifies pleasure, and whatever other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> honours the elements, but places not over them the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nor apprehends the Creator. </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> also, whom he mentions too, say not well that the Deity, being a body, pervades the vilest matter. He calls the jugglery of logic <q>the tradition of men.</q> Wherefore also he adds, <q>Avoid juvenile  questions. For such contentions are puerile.</q> <q>But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is no lover of boys,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. And our struggle, according to Gorgias Leontinus, requires two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash; boldness and wisdom&mdash;boldness to undergo danger, and wisdom to understand the enigma. For the Word, like the Olympian proclamation, calls him who is willing, and crowns him who is able to continue unmoved as far as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is concerned. And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Word does not wish him who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be idle. For He says, <q>Seek, and you shall find.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021923"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> But seeking ends in finding, driving out the empty trifling, and approving of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> which confirms our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>And this I say, lest any man beguile you with enticing words,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021924"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse4">Colossians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> says the apostle, evidently as having learned to distinguish what was said by him, and as being taught to meet objections. <q>As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021925"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse6">Colossians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> Now persuasion is [the means of] being established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>Beware lest any man spoil you of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit,</q> which does away with <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, <q>after the tradition of men;</q> for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which is in accordance with divine tradition establishes and confirms <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which, being done away with, the economy of the Saviour appears a myth, while we are influenced <q>after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021926"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> For the teaching which is agreeable to Christ deifies the Creator, and traces <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> in particular events,  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the elements to be capable of change and production, and teaches that we ought to aim at rising up to the power which assimilates to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to prefer the dispensation  as holding the first rank and superior to all training.</p>

<p>The elements are worshipped,&mdash; the air by Diogenes, the water by Thales, the fire by Hippasus; and by those who suppose atoms to be the first principles of things, arrogating the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, being wretched creatures devoted to pleasure.  <q>Wherefore I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>that your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may abound yet more and more, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and in all judgment, that you may approve things that are excellent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021930"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse9">Philippians&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> <q>Since, when we were children,</q> says the same apostle, <q>we were kept in bondage under the rudiments of the world.

Whence it is said, <q>If any man loves, he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Mysteries of the Faith Not to Be Divulged to All</h2>

<p>But since this tradition is not published alone for him who perceives the magnificence of the word; it is requisite, therefore, to hide in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the wisdom spoken, which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> taught. Now, therefore, Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has his tongue purified by fire, so that he may be able to tell the vision. And we must purify not the tongue alone, but also the ears, if we attempt to be partakers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Such were the impediments in the way of my writing. And even now I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, as it is said, <q>to cast the pearls before swine, lest they tread them under foot, and turn and rend us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021940"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> For it is difficult to exhibit the really pure and transparent words respecting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, to swinish and untrained hearers.

<h2>Chapter 13. All Sects of Philosophy Contain a Germ of Truth</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one (for <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> has ten thousand by-paths); just as the Bacchantes tore asunder the limbs of Pentheus, so the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> both of barbarian and Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> have done with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and each vaunts as the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the portion which has fallen to its lot. But all, in my opinion,  are illuminated by the dawn of Light.  Let all, therefore, both Greeks and barbarians, who have aspired after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;both those who possess not a little, and those who have any portion&mdash;produce whatever they have of the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Eternity, for instance, presents in an instant the future and the present, also the past of time. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, much more powerful than limitless duration, can collect its proper germs, though they have fallen on foreign soil. For we shall find that very many of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> that are held by such <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> as have not become utterly senseless, and are not cut out from the order of nature (by cutting off Christ, as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the fable dismembered the man),  though appearing unlike one another, correspond in their origin and with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as a whole. For they coincide in one, either as a part, or a species, or a genus. For instance, though the highest note is different from the lowest note, yet both compose one harmony. And in numbers an even number differs from an odd number; but both suit in arithmetic; as also is the case with figure, the circle, and the triangle, and the square, and whatever figures differ from one another. Also, in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, all the parts, though differing one from another, preserve their relation to the whole. So, then, the barbarian and Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has torn off a fragment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not from the mythology of Dionysus, but from the theology of the ever-living Word. And He who brings again together the separate fragments, and makes them one, will without peril, be assured, contemplate the perfect Word, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore it is written in Ecclesiastes: <q>And I added wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem; and my heart saw many things; and besides, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and understanding. And this also is the choice of the spirit, because in abundance of wisdom is abundance of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q>  He who is conversant with all kinds of wisdom, will be pre-eminently a gnostic.  Now it is written, <q>Abundance of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of wisdom will give life to him who is of it.</q>  And again, what is said is confirmed more clearly by this saying, <q>All things are in the sight of those who understand</q>&mdash; all things, both Hellenic and barbarian; but the one or the other is not all. <q>They are right to those who wish to receive understanding. Choose instruction, and not silver, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> above tested gold,</q> and prefer also sense to pure gold; <q>for wisdom is better than precious stones, and no precious thing is worth it.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Succession of Philosophers in Greece</h2>

<p>The Greeks say, that after Orpheus and Linus, and the most ancient of the poets that appeared among them, the seven, called wise, were the first that were admired for their wisdom. Of whom four were of Asia&mdash; Thales of Miletus, and Bias of Priene, Pittacus of Mitylene, and Cleobulus of Lindos; and two of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Solon the Athenian, and Chilon the Laced&aelig;monian; and the seventh, some say, was Periander of Corinth; others, Anacharsis the Scythian; others, Epimenides the Cretan, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as a Greek <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, whom he mentions in the Epistle to Titus, where he speaks thus: <q>One of themselves, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of their own, said, <em>The Cretans are always liars, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beasts, slow bellies.</em> And this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021952"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse12">Titus&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span> You see how even to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Greeks he attributes something of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and is not ashamed,  when discoursing for the edification of some and the shaming of others, to make use of Greek poems. Accordingly to the Corinthians (for this is not the only instance), while discoursing on the resurrection of the dead, he makes use of a tragic Iambic line, when he said, <q>What advantages it me if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. Be not deceived; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good manners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021954"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:32-33</a></span> Others have enumerated Acusilaus the Argive among the seven wise men; and others, Pherecydes of Syros. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> substitutes Myso the Chenian for Periander, whom he deemed unworthy of wisdom, on account of his having reigned as a tyrant. That the wise men among the Greeks flourished after the age of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, will, a little after, be shown. But the style of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> among them, as Hebraic and enigmatical, is now to be considered. They adopted brevity, as suited for exhortation, and most useful. Even <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, that of old this mode was purposely in vogue among all the Greeks, especially the Laced&aelig;monians and Cretans, who enjoyed the best <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</p>

<p>The expression, <q>Know yourself,</q> some supposed to be Chilon's. But Cham&aelig;leon, in his book <em>About the Gods</em>, ascribes it to Thales; Aristotle to the Pythian. It may be an injunction to the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For it is not possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the parts without the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the whole; and one must study the genesis of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, that thereby we may be able to learn the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man. Again, to Chilon the Laced&aelig;monian they attribute, <q>Let nothing be too much.</q>  Strato, in his book <em>Of Inventions</em>, ascribes the apophthegm to Stratodemus of Tegea. Didymus assigns it to Solon; as also to Cleobulus the saying, <q>A middle course is best.</q> And the expression, <q>Come under a pledge, and mischief is at hand,</q> Cleomenes says, in his book <em>Concerning Hesiod</em>, was uttered before by Homer in the lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Wretched pledges, for the wretched, to be pledged.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>The Aristotelians judge it to be Chilon's; but Didymus says the advice was that of Thales. Then, next in order, the saying, <q>All men are bad,</q> or, <q>The most of men are bad</q> (for the same apophthegm is expressed in two ways), Sotades the Byzantian says that it was Bias's. And the aphorism, <q>Practice conquers everything,</q>  they will have it to be Periander's; and likewise the advice, <q>Know the opportunity,</q> to have been a saying of Pittacus. Solon made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, Pittacus for the Mitylenians. And at a late date, Pythagoras, the pupil of Pherecydes, first called himself a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Accordingly, after the fore-mentioned three men, there were three schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, named after the places where they lived: the Italic from Pythagoras, the Ionic from Thales, the Eleatic from Xenophanes. Pythagoras was a Samian, the son of Mnesarchus, as Hippobotus says: according to Aristoxenus, in his life of Pythagoras and Aristarchus and Theopompus, he was a Tuscan; and according to Neanthes, a Syrian or a Tyrian. So that Pythagoras was, according to the most, of barbarian extraction. Thales, too, as Leander and Herodotus relate, was a Ph&oelig;nician; as some suppose, a Milesian. He alone seems to have met the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Egyptians. But no one is described as his teacher, nor is any one mentioned as the teacher of Pherecydes of Syros, who had Pythagoras as his pupil. But the Italic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that of Pythagoras, grew old in Metapontum in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Anaximander of Miletus, the son of Praxiades, succeeded Thales; and was himself succeeded by Anaximenes of Miletus, the son of Eurustratus; after whom came Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig;, the son of Hegesibulus.  He transferred his school from Ionia to Athens. He was succeeded by Archelaus, whose pupil Socrates was.</p> <blockquote><p><q>From these turned aside, the stone-mason; <br>Talker about <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; the enchanter of the Greeks,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says Timon in his <em>Satirical Poems</em>, on account of his quitting physics for ethics. Antisthenes, after being a pupil of Socrates, introduced the Cynic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> withdrew to the Academy. Aristotle, after studying <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> under <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, withdrew to the Lyceum, and founded the Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. He was succeeded by Theophrastus, who was succeeded by Strato, and he by Lycon, then Critolaus, and then Diodorus. Speusippus was the successor of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; his successor was Xenocrates; and the successor of the latter, Polemo. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Polemo were Crates and Crantor, in whom the old Academy founded by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> ceased. Arcesilaus was the associate of Crantor; from whom, down to Hegesilaus, the Middle Academy flourished. Then Carneades succeeded Hegesilaus, and others came in succession. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Crates was Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. He was succeeded by Cleanthes; and the latter by Chrysippus, and others after him. Xenophanes of Colophon was the founder of the Eleatic school, who, Tim&aelig;us says, lived in the time of Hiero, lord of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and Epicharmus the poet; and Apollodorus says that he was born in the fortieth Olympiad, and reached to the times of Darius and Cyrus. Parmenides, accordingly, was the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Xenophanes, and Zeno of him; then came Leucippus, and then Democritus. Disciples of Democritus were Protagoras of Abdera, and Metrodorus of Chios, whose pupil was Diogenes of Smyrna; and his again Anaxarchus, and his Pyrrho, and his Nausiphanes. Some say that <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> was a scholar of his.</p>

<p>Such, in an epitome, is the succession of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks. The periods of the originators of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are now to be specified successively, in order that, by comparison, we may show that the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was older by many generations. </p>

<p>It has been said of Xenophanes that he was the founder of the Eleatic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. And Eudemus, in the <em>Astrological Histories</em>, says that Thales foretold the eclipse of the sun, which took place at the time that the Medians and the Lydians fought, in the reign of Cyaxares the father of Astyages over the Medes, and of Alyattus the son of Cr&oelig;sus over the Lydians. Herodotus in his first book agrees with him. The date is about the fiftieth Olympiad. Pythagoras is ascertained to have lived in the days of Polycrates the tyrant, about the sixty-second Olympiad. Mnesiphilus is described as a follower of Solon, and was a contemporary of Themistocles. Solon therefore flourished about the forty-sixth Olympiad. For Heraclitus, the son of Bauso, persuaded Melancomas the tyrant to abdicate his sovereignty. He despised the invitation of king Darius to visit the Persians.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Greek Philosophy in Great Part Derived from the Barbarians</h2>

<p>These are the times of the oldest wise men and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too, show Homer to have been an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>. Thales was a Ph&oelig;nician by birth, and was said to have consorted with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Egyptians; as also Pythagoras did with the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by whom he was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common hall  which he maintained.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Whence, writing in the Ph&oelig;do that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> can receive aid from all sides, he said: <q>Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the barbarians.</q>  Thus <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thinks that some of the barbarians, too, are <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, on the other hand, supposes that only Greeks can philosophise. And in the <em>Symposium</em>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, landing the barbarians as practising <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with conspicuous excellence,  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> says: <q>And in many other instances both among Greeks and barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous.</q> And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <q>they think that good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, on quitting the super-celestial region, submit to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of men;</q> and these make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and publish <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <q>than which no greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or will come.</q> </p>

<p>And as appears to me, it was in consequence of perceiving the great benefit which is conferred through wise men, that the men themselves were honoured and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> cultivated publicly by all the Brahmins, and the Odrysi, and the Get&aelig;. And such were strictly deified by the race of the Egyptians, by the Chaldeans and the Arabians, called the Happy, and those that inhabited Palestine, by not the least portion of the Persian race, and by innumerable other races besides these. And it is well known that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is found perpetually celebrating the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> among the barbarians. Wherefore he also called the races of the barbarians, <q>races of barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>,</q> recognising, in the Ph&oelig;drus, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king, and shows him to us wiser than Theut, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be Hermes. But in the Charmides, it is manifest that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> certain Thracians who were said to make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. And Pythagoras is reported to have been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Sonches the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> arch-<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, of Sechnuphis of Heliopolis; and Eudoxus, of Cnidius of Konuphis, who was also an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>. And in his book, <em>On the Soul</em>,  <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> again manifestly recognises <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, when he introduces a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> announcing the word of Lachesis, uttering predictions to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> whose destiny is becoming fixed. And in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em> he introduces Solon, the very wise, learning from the barbarian. The substance of the declaration is to the following effect: <q>O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children. And no Greek is an old man. For you have no learning that is hoary with age.</q> </p>

<p>Democritus appropriated the Babylonian ethic discourses, for he is said to have combined with his own compositions a translation of the column of Acicarus.  And you may find the distinction notified by him when he writes, <q>Thus says Democritus.</q> About himself, too, where, pluming himself on his erudition, he says, <q>I have roamed over the most ground of any man of my time, investigating the most remote parts. I have seen the most skies and lands, and I have heard of learned men in very great numbers. And in composition no one has surpassed me; in demonstration, not even those among the Egyptians who are called Arpenodapt&aelig;, with all of whom I lived in exile up to eighty years.</q> For he went to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and Persis, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to learn from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>Zoroaster the Magus, Pythagoras showed to be a Persian. Of the secret books of this man, those who follow the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Prodicus boast to be in possession. Alexander, in his book <em>On the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> Symbols</em>, relates that Pythagoras was a pupil of Nazaratus the Assyrian  (some think that he is Ezekiel; but he is not, as will afterwards be shown), and will have it that, in addition to these, Pythagoras was a hearer of the Galat&aelig; and the Brahmins. Clearchus the Peripatetic says that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a Jew who associated with Aristotle.  Heraclitus says that, not humanly, but rather by God's aid, the Sibyl spoke.  They say, accordingly, that at Delphi a stone was shown beside the oracle, on which, it is said, sat the first Sibyl, who came from Helicon, and had been reared by the Muses. But some say that she came from Milea, being the daughter of Lamia of Sidon.  And Serapion, in his epic verses, says that the Sibyl, even when dead, ceased not from <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. And he writes that, what proceeded from her into the air after her death, was what gave oracular utterances in voices and omens; and on her body being changed into earth, and the grass as natural growing out of it, whatever beasts happening to be in that place fed on it exhibited to men an accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of futurity by their entrails. He thinks also, that the face seen in the moon is her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. So much for the Sibyl.</p>

<p>Numa the king of the Romans was a <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, and aided by the precepts of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, prohibited from making an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and of the shape of a living creature. Accordingly, during the first hundred and seventy years, though building temples, they made no cast or graven image. For Numa secretly showed them that the Best of Beings could not be apprehended except by the mind alone. Thus <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to Greece. First in its ranks were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Egyptians; and the Chaldeans among the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>; and the Druids among the Gauls; and the Saman&aelig;ans among the Bactrians; and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Celts; and the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> of the Persians, who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of Jud&aelig;a guided by a star. The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarman&aelig;,  and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarman&aelig; who are called Hylobii  neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a> in the present day, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not marriage nor begetting of children.</p>

<p>Some, too, of the Indians <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precepts of Buddha;  whom, on account of his extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, they have raised to divine honours.</p>

<p>Anacharsis was a Scythian, and is recorded to have excelled many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks. And the Hyperboreans, Hellanicus relates, dwelt beyond the Riph&aelig;an mountains, and inculcated <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, not eating flesh, but using nuts. Those who are sixty years old they take without the gates, and do away with. There are also among the Germans those called sacred <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who, by inspecting the whirlpools of rivers and the eddies, and observing the noises of streams, presage and predict future events.  These did not allow the men to fight against C&aelig;sar till the new moon shone.</p>

<p>Of all these, by far the oldest is the Jewish race; and that their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> committed to writing has the precedence of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> among the Greeks, the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> Philo  shows at large; and, besides him, Aristobulus the Peripatetic, and several others, not to waste time, in going over them by name. Very clearly the author Megasthenes, the contemporary of Seleucus Nicanor, writes as follows in the third of his books, <em>On Indian Affairs:</em> <q>All that was said about nature by the ancients is said also by those who philosophise beyond Greece: some things by the Brahmins among the Indians, and others by those called <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</q> Some more fabulously say that certain of those called the Id&aelig;an Dactyli were the first wise men; to whom are attributed the invention of what are called the <q>Ephesian letters,</q> and of numbers in music. For which reason dactyls in music received their name. And the Id&aelig;an Dactyli were Phrygians and barbarians. Herodotus relates that Hercules, having grown a sage and a student of physics, received from the barbarian Atlas, the Phrygian, the columns of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; the fable meaning that he received by instruction the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the heavenly bodies. And Hermippus of Berytus calls Charon the Centaur wise; about whom, he that wrote <em>The Battle of the Titans</em> says, <q>that he first led the race of mortals to righteousness, by teaching them the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and propitiatory <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the figures of Olympus.</q> By him Achilles, who fought at Troy, was taught. And Hippo, the daughter of the Centaur, who dwelt with &AElig;olus, taught him her father's science, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of physics. Euripides also testifies of Hippo as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Who first, by oracles, presaged, <br>And by the rising stars, events divine.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>By this &AElig;olus, Ulysses was received as a guest after the taking of Troy. Mark the epochs by comparison with the age of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and with the high antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> promulgated by him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. That the Inventors of Other Arts Were Mostly Barbarians</h2>

<p>And barbarians were inventors not only of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but almost of every art. The Egyptians were the first to introduce <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Similarly also the Chaldeans. The Egyptians first showed how to burn lamps, and divided the year into twelve months, prohibited intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the temples, and enacted that no one should enter the temples  from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without bathing. Again, they were the inventors of geometry. There are some who say that the Carians invented prognostication by the stars. The Phrygians were the first who attended to the flight of birds. And the Tuscans, neighbours of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, were adepts at the art of the Haruspex. The Isaurians and the Arabians invented augury, as the Telmesians <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams. The Etruscans invented the trumpet, and the Phrygians the flute. For Olympus and Marsyas were Phrygians. And Cadmus, the inventor of letters among the Greeks, as Euphorus says, was a Ph&oelig;nician; whence also Herodotus writes that they were called Ph&oelig;nician letters. And they say that the Ph&oelig;nicians and the Syrians first invented letters; and that Apis, an aboriginal inhabitant of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, invented the healing art before Io came into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. But afterwards they say that Asclepius improved the art. Atlas the Libyan was the first who built a ship and navigated the sea. Kelmis and Damnaneus, Id&aelig;an Dactyli, first discovered iron in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. Another Id&aelig;an discovered the tempering of brass; according to Hesiod, a Scythian. The Thracians first invented what is called a scimitar (<span class="greek">&#x1F05;&#x03C1;&#x03C0;&#x03B7;</span>)&mdash;it is a curved sword&mdash;and were the first to use shields on horseback. Similarly also the Illyrians invented the shield (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;</span>). Besides, they say that the Tuscans invented the art of moulding clay; and that Itanus (he was a Samnite) first fashioned the oblong shield (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>). Cadmus the Ph&oelig;nician invented stonecutting, and discovered the gold mines on the Pang&aelig;an mountain. Further, another nation, the Cappadocians, first invented the instrument called the nabla,  and the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> in the same way the dichord. The Carthaginians were the first that constructed a trireme; and it was built by Bosporus, an aboriginal.  Medea, the daughter of &AElig;etas, a Colchian, first invented the dyeing of hair. Besides, the Noropes (they are a P&aelig;onian race, and are now called the Norici) worked copper, and were the first that purified iron. Amycus the king of the Bebryci was the first inventor of boxing-gloves.  In music, Olympus the Mysian practiced the Lydian harmony; and the people called Troglodytes invented the sambuca,  a musical instrument. It is said that the crooked pipe was invented by Satyrus the Phrygian; likewise also diatonic harmony by Hyagnis, a Phrygian too; and notes by Olympus, a Phrygian; as also the Phrygian harmony, and the half-Phrygian and the half-Lydian, by Marsyas, who belonged to the same region as those mentioned above. And the Doric was invented by Thamyris the Thracian. We have heard that the Persians were the first who fashioned the chariot, and bed, and footstool; and the Sidonians the first to construct a trireme. The Sicilians, close to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, were the first inventors of the phorminx, which is not much inferior to the lyre. And they invented castanets. In the time of Semiramis queen of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>,  they relate that linen garments were invented. And Hellanicus says that Atossa queen of the Persians was the first who composed a letter. These things are reported by Scamo of Mitylene, Theophrastus of Ephesus, Cydippus of Mantinea, also Antiphanes, Aristodemus, and Aristotle; and besides these, Philostephanus, and also Strato the Peripatetic, in his books <em>Concerning Inventions.</em> I have added a few details from them, in order to confirm the inventive and practically useful genius of the barbarians, by whom the Greeks profited in their studies. And if any one objects to the barbarous language, Anacharsis says, <q>All the Greeks speak Scythian to me.</q> It was he who was held in admiration by the Greeks, who said, <q>My covering is a cloak; my supper, milk and cheese.</q> You see that the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> professes <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, not words. The apostle thus speaks: <q>So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue a word easy to be understood, how shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is spoken? For you shall speak into the air. There are, it may be, so many kind of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. Therefore if I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto me.</q> And, <q>Let him that speaks in an unknown tongue <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may interpret.</q> </p>

<p>Nay more, it was late before the teaching and writing of discourses reached Greece. Alcm&aelig;on, the son of Perithus, of Crotona, first composed a treatise on nature. And it is related that Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig;, the son of Hegesibulus, first published a book in writing. The first to adapt music to poetical compositions was Terpander of Antissa; and he set the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Laced&aelig;monians to music. Lasus of Hermione invented the dithyramb; Stesichorus of Himera, the hymn; Alcman the Spartan, the choral song; Anacreon of Teos, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> songs; Pindar the Theban, the dance accompanied with song. Timotheus of Miletus was the first to execute those musical compositions called <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span> on the lyre, with dancing. Moreover, the iambus was invented by Archilochus of Paros, and the choliambus by Hipponax of Ephesus. Tragedy owed its origin to Thespis the Athenian, and comedy to Susarion of Icaria. Their dates are handed down by the grammarians. But it were tedious to specify them accurately: presently, however, Dionysus, on whose account the Dionysian spectacles are celebrated, will be shown to be later than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. They say that Antiphon of Rhamnusium, the son of Sophilus, first invented scholastic discourses and rhetorical figures, and was the first who pled causes for a fee, and wrote a forensic speech for delivery,  as Diodorus says. And Apollodorus of Cuma first assumed the name of critic, and was called a grammarian. Some say it was Eratosthenes of Cyrene who was first so called, since he published two books which he entitled <em>Grammatica.</em>The first who was called a grammarian, as we now use the term, was Praxiphanes, the son of Disnysophenes of Mitylene. Zeleucus the Locrian was reported to have been the first to have framed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (in writing). Others say that it was Menos the son of Zeus, in the time of Lynceus. He comes after Danaus, in the eleventh generation from Inachus and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; as we shall show a little further on. And Lycurgus, who lived many years after the taking of Troy, legislated for the Laced&aelig;monians a hundred and fifty years before the Olympiads. We have spoken before of the age of Solon. Draco (he was a legislator too) is discovered to have lived about the three hundred and ninth Olympiad. Antilochus, again, who wrote of the learned men from the age of Pythagoras to the death of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, which took place in the tenth day of the month Gamelion, makes up altogether three hundred and twelve years. Moreover, some say that Phanothea, the wife of Icarius, invented the heroic hexameter; others Themis, one of the Titanides. Didymus, however, in his work <em>On the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> Philosophy</em>, relates that Theano of Crotona was the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who cultivated <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and composed poems. The Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> then, according to some, apprehended the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> accidentally, dimly, partially; as others will have it, was set a-going by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Several suppose that certain powers, descending from heaven, inspired the whole of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But if the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> comprehends not the whole extent of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and besides is destitute of strength to perform the commandments of the Lord, yet it prepares the way for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> royal teaching; training in some way or other, and moulding the character, and fitting him who believes in Providence for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. On the Saying of the Saviour, <q>All that Came Before Me Were Thieves and Robbers.</q> </h2>

<p>But, say they, it is written, <q>All who were before the Lord's advent are thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>.</q> All, then, who are in the Word (for it is these that were previous to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word) are understood generally. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, being sent and inspired by the Lord, were not thieves, but servants. The Scripture accordingly says, <q>Wisdom sent her servants, inviting with loud proclamation to a goblet of wine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021986"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;9:3</a></span> </p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, it is said, was not sent by the Lord, but came stolen, or given by a thief. It was then some power or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that had learned something of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but abode not in it, that inspired and taught these things, not without the Lord's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> before the constitution of each <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> the issues of futurity, but without His prohibition.</p>

<p>For the theft which reached men then, had some advantage; not that he who perpetrated the theft had utility in his eye, but Providence directed the issue of the audacious deed to utility. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many are perpetually assailing us with the allegation, that not to prevent a thing happening, is to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of it happening. For they say, that the man who does not take precaution against a theft, or does not prevent it, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of it: as he is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the conflagration who has not quenched it at the beginning; and the master of the vessel who does not reef the sail, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the shipwreck. Certainly those who are the causes of such events are punished by the law. For to him who had power to prevent, attaches the blame of what happens. We say to them, that causation is seen in doing, working, acting; but the not preventing is in this respect inoperative. Further, causation attaches to activity; as in the case of the shipbuilder in relation to the origin of the vessel, and the builder in relation to the construction of the house. But that which does not prevent is separated from what takes place. Wherefore the effect will be accomplished; because that which could have prevented neither acts nor prevents. For what activity does that which prevents not exert? Now their assertion is reduced to absurdity, if they shall say that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the wound is not the dart, but the shield, which did not prevent the dart from passing through; and if they blame not the thief, but the man who did not prevent the theft. Let them then say, that it was not Hector that burned the ships of the Greeks, but Achilles; because, having the power to prevent Hector, he did not prevent him; but out of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (and it depended on himself to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> or not) did not keep back the fire, and was a concurring <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, being possessed of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, was able both to repent and to steal; and it was he who was the author of the theft, not the Lord, who did not prevent him. But neither was the gift hurtful, so as to require that prevention should intervene.</p>

<p>But if strict accuracy must be employed in dealing with them, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that that which does not prevent what we assert to have taken place in the theft, is not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> at all; but that what prevents is involved in the accusation of being a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For he that protects with a shield is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of him whom he protects not being wounded; preventing him, as he does, from being wounded. For the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of Socrates was a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not by not preventing, but by exhorting, even if (strictly speaking) he did not exhort. And neither praises nor censures, neither rewards nor punishments, are right, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has not the power of inclination and disinclination, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is involuntary. Whence he who prevents is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; while he who prevents not judges <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> choice. So in no respect is God the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But since free choice and inclination originate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and a mistaken judgment sometimes prevails, from which, since it is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and stupidity, we do not take pains to recede, punishments are rightly inflicted. For to take fever is involuntary; but when one takes fever through his own fault, from excess, we blame him. Inasmuch, then, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is involuntary&mdash;for no one prefers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but induced by the pleasure that is in it, and imagining it good, considers it desirable&mdash;such being the case, to free ourselves from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and voluptuous choice, and above all, to withhold our assent from those delusive phantasies, depends on ourselves. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is called <q>thief and robber;</q> having mixed <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as tares with the wheat. <q>All, then, that came before the Lord, were thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>;</q> not absolutely all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but all the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and all who were not properly sent by Him. For the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> possessed the prophetic name dishonestly, being <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the liar. For the Lord says, <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him. When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021987"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> </p>

<p>But among the lies, the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> also told some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things. And in reality they prophesied <q>in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>,</q> as  the servants of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. And the Shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of repentance, says to Hermas, of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>: <q>For he speaks some truths. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> fills him with his own spirit, if perchance he may be able to cast down any one from what is right.</q> All things, therefore, are dispensed from heaven for good, <q>that by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> foreknowledge,  which He purposed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021990"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> Nothing withstands God: nothing opposes Him: seeing He is Lord and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Further, the counsels and activities of those who have rebelled, being partial, proceed from a bad disposition, as bodily diseases from a bad constitution, but are guided by universal Providence to a salutary issue, even though the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be productive of disease. It is accordingly the greatest achievement of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine Providence</a>, not to allow the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which has sprung from <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, to remain useless, and for no good, and not to become in all respects injurious. For it is the work of the divine wisdom, and excellence, and power, not alone to do good (for this is, so to speak, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is of fire to warm and of light to illumine), but especially to ensure that what happens through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> hatched by any, may come to a good and useful issue, and to use to advantage those things which appear to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as also the testimony which accrues from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</p>

<p>There is then in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, though stolen as the fire by Prometheus, a slender spark, capable of being fanned into flame, a trace of wisdom and an impulse from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Well, be it so that <q>the thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a></q> are the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks, who from the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> before the coming of the Lord received fragments of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and claimed these as their own teachings, disguising some points, treating others sophistically by their ingenuity, and discovering other things, for perchance they had <q>the spirit of perception.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021991"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;28:3</a></span> Aristotle, too, assented to Scripture, and declared sophistry to have stolen wisdom, as we intimated before. And the apostle says, <q>Which things we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> teaches.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021992"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> For of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> it is said, <q>We have all received of His fullness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021993"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;1:16</a></span> that is, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>. So that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are not thieves. <q>And my doctrine is not Mine,</q> says the Lord, <q>but the Father's which sent me.</q> And of those who steal He says: <q>But he that speaks of himself, seeks his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  Such are the Greeks, <q>lovers of their own selves, and boasters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021995"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Scripture, when it speaks of these as wise, does not brand those who are really wise, but those who are wise in appearance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. He Illustrates the Apostle's Saying, <q>I Will Destroy the Wisdom of the Wise.</q></h2>

<p>And of such it is said, <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: I will bring to nothing the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q> The apostle accordingly adds, <q>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?</q> setting in contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, the disputers  of this world, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <q>Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of the world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021997"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> which is equivalent to, showed it to be foolish, and not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as they thought. And if you ask the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their seeming wisdom, he will say, <q>because of the blindness of their heart;</q> since <q>in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that is, as proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not,</q> in the wisdom <q>which spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> <q>Him,</q>  that is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;<q>it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching</q>&mdash; what seemed to the Greeks foolishness&mdash; <q>to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> require signs,</q> in order to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <q>and the Greeks seek after wisdom,</q> plainly those reasonings styled <q>irresistible,</q> and those others, namely, syllogisms. <q>But we preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> crucified; to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block,</q> because, though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the event: <q>to the Greeks, foolishness;</q> for those who in their own estimation are wise, consider it fabulous that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should speak by man and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have a Son, and especially that that Son should have suffered. Whence their preconceived idea inclines them to disbelieve. For the advent of the Saviour did not make people foolish, and hard of heart, and unbelieving, but made them understanding, amenable to persuasion, and believing. But those that would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by separating themselves from the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> adherence of those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be without understanding, unbelievers and fools. <q>But to them who are called, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, Christ is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Should we not understand (as is better) the words rendered, <q>Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of the world?</q> negatively: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not made foolish the wisdom of the world?</q>&mdash; so that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their hardness of heart may not appear to have proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>making foolish the wisdom of the world.</q> For on all accounts, being wise, they incur greater blame in not believing the proclamation. For the preference and choice of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But that declaration, <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</q> declares Him to have sent forth light, by bringing forth in opposition the despised and contemned barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; as the lamp, when shone upon by the sun, is said to be extinguished, on account of its not then exerting the same power. All having been therefore called, those who are willing to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> have been named  <q>called.</q> For there is no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Those of either race who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, are <q>a peculiar people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022000"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse14">Titus&nbsp;2:14</a></span> And in the Acts of the Apostles you will find this, word for word, <q>Those then who received his word were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022001"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;2:41</a></span> but those who would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> kept themselves aloof. To these <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> says, <q>If you be willing and hear me, you shall eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022002"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19</a></span> proving that choice or refusal depends on ourselves. The apostle designates the doctrine which is according to the Lord, <q>the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> in order to show that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has been communicated by the Son. Further, he, who has a show of wisdom, has certain exhortations enjoined on him by the apostle: <q>That you put on the new man, which after God is renewed in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Neither give place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labour, working that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a></q> (and to work is to labour in seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for it is accompanied with rational well-doing), <q>that you may have to give to him that has need,</q>  both of worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and of divine wisdom. For he wishes both that the word be taught, and that the money be put into the bank, accurately tested, to accumulate interest. Whence he adds, <q>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,</q>&mdash; that is <q>corrupt communication</q> which proceeds out of conceit&mdash;<q>but that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the use of edifying, that it may minister <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the hearers.</q> And the word of the good God must needs be good. And how is it possible that he who saves shall not be good?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. That the Philosophers Have Attained to Some Portion of Truth</h2>

<p>Since, then, the Greeks are testified to have laid down some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinions, we may from this point take a glance at the testimonies. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the Acts of the Apostles, is recorded to have said to the Areopagites, <q>I perceive that you are more than ordinarily religious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with the inscription, To The Unknown God. Whom therefore you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> worship, Him declare I unto you. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He gives to all life, and breath, and all things; and has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him; though He be not far from every one of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we also are His offspring.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022004"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;17:22-28</a></span> Whence it is evident that the apostle, by availing himself of poetical examples from the <em>Phenomena</em> of Aratus, approves of what had been well spoken by the Greeks; and intimates that, by the unknown <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God the Creator was in a roundabout way worshipped by the Greeks; but that it was necessary by positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to apprehend and learn Him by the Son. <q>Wherefore, then, I send you to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> it is said, <q>to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that they may receive forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022005"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;26:17-18</a></span> Such, then, are the eyes of the blind which are opened. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father by the Son is the comprehension of the <q>Greek circumlocution;</q>  and to turn from the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is to change from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through which bondage was produced. We do not, indeed, receive absolutely all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but that of which Socrates  speaks in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. <q>For there are (as they say) in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> many bearers of the thyrsus, but few bacchanals;</q> meaning, <q>that many are called, but few chosen.</q> He accordingly plainly adds: <q>These, in my opinion, are none else than those who have philosophized right; to belong to whose number, I myself have left nothing undone in life, as far as I could, but have endeavoured in every way. Whether we have endeavoured rightly and achieved anything, we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when we have gone there, if God will, a little afterwards.</q> Does he not then seem to declare from the Hebrew Scriptures the righteous man's hope, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after death? And in <em>Demodocus</em>  (if that is really the work of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>): <q>And do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that I call it <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> to spend life pottering about the arts, or learning many things, but something different; since I, at least, would consider this a disgrace.</q> For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, I reckon, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many things does not educate the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q>  according to Heraclitus. And in the fifth book of the <em>Republic</em>,  he says, <q>'Shall we then call all these, and the others which study such things, and those who apply themselves to the meaner arts, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>?' 'By no means,' I said, 'but like <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.' 'And whom,' said he, 'do you call <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>?' 'Those,' said I, 'who delight in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is not in geometry, with its postulates and hypotheses; nor in music, which is conjectural; nor in astronomy, crammed full of physical, fluid, and probable causes. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself are requisite&mdash;what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> being one thing, and the ways to the good another.'</q>  So that he does not allow that the curriculum of training suffices for the good, but co-operates in rousing and training the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to intellectual objects. Whether, then, they say that the Greeks gave forth some utterances of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by accident, it is the accident of a divine administration (for no one will, for the sake of the present argument with us, deify chance); or by good fortune, good fortune is not unforeseen. Or were one, on the other hand, to say that the Greeks possessed a natural conception of these things, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the one Creator of nature; just as we also call righteousness natural; or that they had a common <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, let us reflect who is its father, and what righteousness is in the mental economy. For were one to name <q>prediction,</q>  and assign as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <q>combined utterance,</q>  he specifies forms of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Further, others will have it that some truths were uttered by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in appearance.</p>

<p>The divine apostle writes accordingly respecting us: <q>For now we see as through a glass;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022014"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:12</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> ourselves in it by reflection, and simultaneously contemplating, as we can, the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from that, which, in us, is divine. For it is said, <q>Having seen your brother, you have seen your God:</q> methinks that now the Saviour God is declared to us. But after the laying aside of the flesh, <q>face to face,</q>&mdash; then definitely and comprehensively, when the heart becomes pure. And by reflection and direct vision, those among the Greeks who have philosophized accurately, see God. For such, through our weakness, are our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> views, as images are seen in the water, and as we see things through pellucid and transparent bodies. Excellently therefore Solomon says: <q>He who sows righteousness, works <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022015"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse21">Proverbs&nbsp;11:21</a></span> <q>And there are those who, sewing their own, make increase.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022016"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;11:24</a></span> And again: <q>Take care of the verdure on the plain, and you shall cut grass and gather ripe hay, that you may have sheep for clothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022017"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;27:25-26</a></span> You see how care must be taken for external clothing and for keeping. <q>And you shall intelligently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of your flock.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022018"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;27:23</a></span> <q>For when the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves; uncircumcision observing the precepts of the law,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022019"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span> according to the apostle, both before the law and before the advent. As if making comparison of those addicted to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with those called <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,  the Word most clearly says: <q>Better is a friend that is near, than a brother that dwells afar off.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022021"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;27:10</a></span> <q>And he who relies on falsehoods, feeds on the winds, and pursues winged birds.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022022"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;9:12</a></span> I do not think that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> directly declares the Word, although in many instances <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> attempts and persuasively teaches us probable arguments; but it assails the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Accordingly it is added: <q>For he has forsaken the ways of his own vineyard, and wandered in the tracks of his own husbandry.</q> Such are the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which deserted the primitive Church.  Now he who has fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> passes through an arid wilderness, abandoning the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, destitute of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeking waterless water, reaching an uninhabited and thirsty land, collecting sterility with his hands. And those destitute of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that is, those involved in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <q>I enjoin,</q> remarks Wisdom, saying, <q>Touch sweetly stolen bread and the sweet water of theft;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022024"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;9:17</a></span> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> manifestly applying the terms bread and water to nothing else but to those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which employ bread and water in the oblation, not according to the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For there are those who celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> with mere water. <q>But begone, stay not in her place:</q> <em>place</em> is the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He calls it by the equivocal name, <em>place</em>. Then He subjoins: <q>For so shall you pass through the water of another;</q> reckoning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> not proper and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water. <q>And you shall pass over another's river,</q> that rushes along and sweeps down to the sea; into which he is cast who, having diverged from the stability which is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, rushes back into the heathenish and tumultous waves of life.</p> 

<h2>Chapter 20. In What Respect Philosophy Contributes to the Comprehension of Divine Truth</h2>

<p>As many men drawing down the ship, cannot be called many causes, but one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> consisting of many&mdash;for each individual by himself is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the ship being drawn, but along with the rest&mdash;so also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, being the search for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, contributes to the comprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; not as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of comprehension, but a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> along with other things, and co-operator; perhaps also a joint <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And as the several <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are causes of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of one individual; and as both the sun, and the fire, and the bath, and clothing are of one getting warm: so while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, many things contribute to its investigation. But its discovery is by the Son. If then we consider, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is, in power, one. But it is the case, that when exhibited in some things, it is called <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, in others <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and in others manliness or righteousness. By the same analogy, while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, in geometry there is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of geometry; in music, that of music; and in the right <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, there will be Hellenic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But that is the only authentic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unassailable, in which we are instructed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. In the same way we say, that the drachma being one and the same, when given to the shipmaster, is called the fare; to the tax-gatherer, tax; to the landlord, rent; to the teacher, fees; to the seller, an earnest. And each, whether it be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, called by the same name, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its own peculiar effect alone; and from the blending of them arises a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life. For we are not made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by names alone, when we say that a good life is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and that the man who is adorned in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> contributes remotely to the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by reaching, by diverse essays, after the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which touches close on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed by us, it aids him who aims at grasping it, in accordance with the Word, to apprehend <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is distinct from that held by us (although it has got the same name), both in respect of extent of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, certainly of demonstration, divine power, and the like. For we are taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being instructed in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>sacred letters</q>  by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Whence those, to whom we refer, influence <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not in the way we do, but by different teaching. And if, for the sake of those who are fond of fault-finding, we must draw a distinction, by saying that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is a concurrent and cooperating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> apprehension, being the search for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then we shall avow it to be a preparatory training for the enlightened man (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;</span>); not assigning as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that which is but the joint-<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; nor as the upholding <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, what is merely co-operative; nor giving to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> the place of a <em>sine qu&acirc; non</em>. Since almost all of us, without training in arts and sciences, and the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and some even without learning at all, through the influence of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> divine and barbarous, and by power, have through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received the word concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, trained by self-operating wisdom. But that which acts in conjunction with something else, being of itself incapable of operating by itself, we describe as co-operating and concausing, and say that it becomes a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only in virtue of its being a joint-<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and receives the name of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only in respect of its concurring with something else, but that it cannot by itself produce the right effect.</p>

<p>Although at one time <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> justified the Greeks,  not conducting them to that entire righteousness to which it is ascertained to cooperate, as the first and second flight of steps help you in your ascent to the upper room, and the grammarian helps the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Not as if by its abstraction, the perfect Word would be rendered incomplete, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> perish; since also sight, and hearing, and the voice contribute to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but it is the mind which is the appropriate faculty for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. But of those things which co-operate, some contribute a greater amount of power; some, a less. Perspicuity accordingly aids in the communication of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and logic in preventing us from falling under the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> by which we are assailed. But the teaching, which is according to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, is complete in itself and without defect, being <q>the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022027"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not, by its approach, make the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> more powerful; but rendering powerless the assault of sophistry against it, and frustrating the treacherous plots laid against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is said to be the proper <q>fence and wall of the vineyard.</q> And the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is according to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is as necessary for life as bread; while the preparatory discipline is like sauce and sweetmeats. <q>At the end of the dinner, the dessert is pleasant,</q> according to the Theban Pindar.

<h2>Chapter 21. The Jewish Institutions and Laws of Far Higher Antiquity Than the Philosophy of the Greeks</h2>

<p>On the plagiarizing of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> from the Hebrews, we shall treat a little afterwards. But first, as due order demands, we must now speak of the epoch of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Hebrews will be demonstrated beyond all contradiction to be the most ancient of all wisdom. This has been discussed with accuracy by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> in his book <em>To the Greeks</em>, and by Cassian in the first book of his <em>Exegetics</em>. Nevertheless our commentary demands that we too should run over what has been said on the point. Apion, then, the grammarian, surnamed Pleistonices, in the fourth book of <em>The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Histories</em>, although of so hostile a disposition towards the Hebrews, being by race an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, as to compose a work against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when referring to Amosis king of the Egyptians, and his exploits, adduces, as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, Ptolemy of Mendes. And his remarks are to the following effect: Amosis, who lived in the time of the Argive Inachus, overthrew Athyria, as Ptolemy of Mendes relates in his <em>Chronology</em>. Now this Ptolemy was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and setting forth the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> kings in three entire books, he says, that the exodus of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, under the conduct of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, took place while Amosis was king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Whence it is seen that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> flourished in the time of Inachus. And of the Hellenic states, the most ancient is the Argolic, I mean that which took its rise from Inachus, as Dionysius of Halicarnassus teaches in his <em>Times</em>. And younger by forty generations than it was Attica, founded by Cecrops, who was an aboriginal of double race, as <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> expressly says; and Arcadia, founded by Pelasgus, younger too by nine generations; and he, too, is said to have been an aboriginal. And more recent than this last by fifty-two generations, was Pthiotis, founded by Deucalion. And from the time of Inachus to the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> twenty generations or more are reckoned; let us say, four hundred years and more. And if Ctesias says that the Assyrian power is many years older than the Greek, the exodus of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> will appear to have taken place in the forty-second year of the Assyrian empire,  in the thirty-second year of the reign of Belochus, in the time of Amosis the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and of Inachus the Argive. And in Greece, in the time of Phoroneus, who succeeded Inachus, the flood of Ogyges occurred; and monarchy subsisted in Sicyon first in the person of &AElig;gialeus, then of Europs, then of Telches; in Crete, in the person of Cres. For Acusilaus says that Phoroneus was the first man. Whence, too, the author of <em>Phoronis</em> said that he was <q>the father of mortal men.</q> Thence <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the <em>Tim&oelig;us</em>, following Acusilaus, writes: <q>And wishing to draw them out into a discussion respecting antiquities, he  said that he ventured to speak of the most remote antiquities of this city  respecting Phoroneus, called the first man, and Niobe, and what happened after the deluge.</q> And in the time of Phorbus lived Act&aelig;us, from whom is derived Actaia, Attica; and in the time of Triopas lived Prometheus, and Atlas, and Epimetheus, and Cecrops of double race, and Ino. And in the time of Crotopus occurred the burning of Pha&euml;thon, and the deluge  of Deucalion; and in the time of Sthenelus, the reign of Amphictyon, and the arrival of Danaus in the Peloponnesus; and trader Dardanus happened the building of Dardania, whom, says Homer,</p> <blockquote><p><q>First cloud-compelling Zeus begot,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>and the transmigration from Crete into <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>. And in the time of Lynceus took place the abduction of Proserpine, and the dedication of the sacred enclosure in Eleusis, and the husbandry of Triptolemus, and the arrival of Cadmus in Thebes, and the reign of Minos. And in the time of Pr&oelig;tus the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Eumolpus with the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> took place; and in the time of Acrisius, the removal of Pelops from Phrygia, the arrival of Ion at Athens; and the second Cecrops appeared, and the exploits of Perseus and Dionysus took place, and Orpheus and Mus&aelig;us lived. And in the eighteenth year of the reign of Agamemnon, Troy was taken, in the first year of the reign of Demophon the son of Theseus at Athens, on the twelfth day of the month Thargelion, as Dionysius the Argive says; but &AElig;gias and Dercylus, in the third book, say that it was on the eighth day of the last division of the month Panemus; Hellanicus says that it was on the twelfth of the month Thargelion; and some of the authors of the <em>Attica</em> say that it was on the eighth of the last division of the month in the last year of Menestheus, at full moon.</p> <blockquote><p><q>It was midnight,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says the author of the <em>Little Iliad</em>,</p> <blockquote><p><q>And the moon shone clear.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Others say, it took place on the same day of Scirophorion. But Theseus, the rival of Hercules, is older by a generation than the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Accordingly Tlepolemus, a son of Hercules, is mentioned by Homer, as having served at Troy.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, is shown to have preceded the deification of Dionysus six hundred and four years, if he was deified in the thirty-second year of the reign of Perseus, as Apollodorus says in his <em>Chronology</em>. From Bacchus to Hercules and the chiefs that sailed with Jason in the ship Argo, are comprised sixty-three years. &AElig;sculapius and the Dioscuri sailed with them, as Apollonius Rhodius testifies in his <em>Argonautics.</em> And from the reign of Hercules, in Argos, to the deification of Hercules and of &AElig;sculapius, are comprised thirty-eight years, according to Apollodorus the chronologist; from this to the deification of Castor and Pollux, fifty-three years. And at this time Troy was taken. And if we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the poet Hesiod, let us hear him:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Then to Jove, Maia, Atlas' daughter, bore renowned Hermes, <br>Herald of the immortals, having ascended the sacred couch. <br>And Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, too, bore an illustrious son, <br>Dionysus, the joy-inspiring, when she mingled with him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Cadmus, the father of Semele, came to Thebes in the time of Lynceus, and was the inventor of the Greek letters. Triopas was a contemporary of Isis, in the seventh generation from Inachus. And Isis, who is the same as Io, is so called, it is said, from her going (<span class="greek">&#x1F30;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) roaming over the whole earth. Her, Istrus, in his work on the migration of the Egyptians, calls the daughter of Prometheus. Prometheus lived in the time of Triopas, in the seventh generation after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. So that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> appears to have flourished even before the birth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, according to the chronology of the Greeks. Leon, who treated of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> divinities, says that Isis by the Greeks was called Ceres, who lived in the time of Lynceus, in the eleventh generation after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And Apis the king of Argos built Memphis, as Aristippus says in the first book of the <em>Arcadica</em>. And Aristeas the Argive says that he was named Serapis, and that it is he that the Egyptians worship. And Nymphodorus of Amphipolis, in the third book of the <em>Institutions of Asia</em>, says that the bull Apis, dead and laid in a coffin (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>), was deposited in the temple of the god (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) there worshipped, and thence was called Soroapis, and afterwards Serapis by the custom of the natives. And Apis is third after Inachus. Further, Latona lived in the time of Tityus. <q>For he dragged Latona, the radiant consort of Zeus.</q> Now Tityus was contemporary with Tantalus. Rightly, therefore, the B&oelig;otian Pindar writes, <q>And in time was Apollo born;</q> and no wonder when he is found along with Hercules, serving Admetus <q>for a long year.</q> Zethus and Amphion, the inventors of music, lived about the age of Cadmus. And should one assert that Phemonoe was the first who sang oracles in verse to Acrisius, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that twenty-seven years after Phemonoe, lived Orpheus, and Mus&aelig;us, and Linus the teacher of Hercules. And Homer and Hesiod are much more recent than the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; and after them the legislators among the Greeks are far more recent, Lycurgus and Solon, and the seven wise men, and Pherecydes of Syros, and Pythagoras the great, who lived later, about the Olympiads, as we have shown. We have also demonstrated <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be more ancient, not only than those called poets and wise men among the Greeks, but than the most of their deities. Nor he alone, but the Sibyl also is more ancient than Orpheus. For it is said, that respecting her appellation and her oracular utterances there are several accounts; that being a Phrygian, she was called Artemis; and that on her arrival at Delphi, she sang&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O Delphians, ministers of far-darting Apollo, <br>I come to declare the mind of &AElig;gis-bearing Zeus, <br>Enraged as I am at my own brother Apollo.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>There is another also, an Erythr&aelig;an, called Herophile. These are mentioned by Heraclides of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> in his work <em>On Oracles</em>. I pass over the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Sibyl, and the Italian, who inhabited the Carmentale in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose son was Evander, who built the temple of Pan in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, called the Lupercal.</p>

<p>It is worth our while, having reached this point, to examine the dates of the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> among the Hebrews who succeeded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. After the close of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses's</a> life, Joshua succeeded to the leadership of the people, and he, after warring for sixty-five years, rested in the good land other five-and-twenty. As the book of Joshua relates, the above mentioned man was the successor of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> twenty-seven years. Then the Hebrews having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, were delivered to Chusachar  king of Mesopotamia for eight years, as the book of Judges mentions. But having afterwards besought the Lord, they receive for leader Gothoniel,  the younger brother of Caleb, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, who, having slain the king of Mesopotamia, ruled over the people forty years in succession. And having again <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, they were delivered into the hands of &AElig;glom  king of the Moabites for eighteen years. But on their repentance, Aod,  a man who had equal use of both hands, of the tribe of Ephraim, was their leader for eighty years. It was he that dispatched &AElig;glom. On the death of Aod, and on their sinning again, they were delivered into the hand of Jabim  king of Canaan twenty years. After him Deborah the wife of Lapidoth, of the tribe of Ephraim, prophesied; and Ozias the son of Rhiesu was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. At her instance Barak the son of Bener,  of the tribe of Naphtali, commanding the army, having joined battle with Sisera, Jabim's commander-in-chief, conquered him. And after that Deborah ruled, judging the people forty years. On her death, the people having again <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, were delivered into the hands of the Midianites seven years. After these events, Gideon, of the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joas, having fought with his three hundred men, and killed a hundred and twenty thousand, ruled forty years; after whom the son of Ahimelech, three years. He was succeeded by Boleas, the son of Bedan, the son of Charran,  of the tribe of Ephraim, who ruled twenty-three years. After whom, the people having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> again, were delivered to the Ammonites eighteen years; and on their repentance were commanded by Jephtha the Gileadite, of the tribe of Manasseh; and he ruled six years. After whom, Abatthan  of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, of the tribe of Juda, ruled seven years. Then Ebron  the Zebulonite, eight years. Then Eglom of Ephraim, eight years. Some add to the seven years of Abatthan the eight of Ebrom.  And after him, the people having again transgressed, came under the power of the foreigners, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, for forty years. But on their returning [to God], they were led by Samson, of the tribe of Dan, who conquered the foreigners in battle. He ruled twenty years. And after him, there being no governor, Eli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> judged the people for forty years. He was succeeded by Samuel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; contemporaneously with whom Saul reigned, who held sway for twenty-seven years. He anointed David. Samuel died two years before Saul, while Abimelech was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. He anointed Saul as king, who was the first that bore regal sway over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> after the judges; the whole duration of whom, down to Saul, was four hundred and sixty-three years and seven months.</p>

<p>Then in the first book of Kings there are twenty years of Saul, during which he reigned after he was renovated. And after the death of Saul, David the son of Jesse, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, reigned next in Hebron, forty years, as is contained in the second book of Kings. And Abiathar the son of Abimelech, of the kindred of Eli, was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. In his time Gad and Nathan prophesied. From Joshua the son of Nun, then, till David received the kingdom, there intervene, according to some, four hundred and fifty years. But, as the chronology set forth shows, five hundred and twenty-three years and seven months are comprehended till the death of David.</p>

<p>And after this Solomon the son of David reigned forty years. Under him Nathan continued to prophesy, who also exhorted him respecting the building of the temple. Achias of Shilo also prophesied. And both the kings, David and Solomon, were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And Sadoc the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> was the first who ministered in the temple which Solomon built, being the eighth from <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. From <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, to the age of Solomon, as some say, are five hundred and ninety-five years, and as others, five hundred and seventy-six.</p>

<p>And if you count, along with the four hundred and fifty years from Joshua to David, the forty years of the rule of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the other eighty years of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses's</a> life previous to the exodus of the Hebrews from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, you will make up the sum in all of six hundred and ten years. But our chronology will run more correctly, if to the five hundred and twenty-three years and seven months till the death of David, you add the hundred and twenty years of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the forty years of Solomon. For you will make up in all, down to the death of Solomon, six hundred and eighty-three years and seven months.</p>

<p>Hiram gave his daughter to Solomon about the time of the arrival of Menelaus in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, after the capture of Troy, as is said by Menander of Pergamus, and L&aelig;tus in <em>The <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>.</em> And after Solomon, Roboam his son reigned for seventeen years; and Abimelech the son of Sadoc was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. In his reign, the kingdom being divided, <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, of the tribe of Ephraim, the servant of Solomon, reigned in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>; and Achias the Shilonite continued to prophesy; also Sam&aelig;as the son of Amame, and he who came from Judah to <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>,  and prophesied against the altar. After him his son Abijam, twenty-three years; and likewise his son Asaman.  The last, in his old age, was diseased in his feet; and in his reign prophesied Jehu the son of Ananias.</p>

<p>After him Jehosaphat his son reigned twenty-five years.  In his reign prophesied Elias the Thesbite, and Mich&aelig;as the son of Jebla, and Abdias the son of Ananias. And in the time of Mich&aelig;as there was also the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> Zedekias, the son of Chonaan. These were followed by the reign of Joram the son of Jehosaphat, for eight years; during whose time prophesied Elias; and after Elias, Elis&aelig;us the son of Saphat. In his reign the people in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> ate doves' dung and their own children. The period of Jehosaphat extends from the close of the third book of Kings to the fourth. And in the reign of Joram, Elias was translated, and Elis&aelig;us the son of Saphat commenced prophesying, and prophesied for six years, being forty years old.</p>

<p>Then Ochozias reigned a year. In his time Elis&aelig;us continued to prophesy, and along with him Adadon&aelig;us.  After him the mother of Ozias,  Gotholia,  reigned eight  years, having slain the children of her brother.  For she was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ahab. But the sister of Ozias, Josab&aelig;a, stole Joas the son of Ozias, and invested him afterwards with the kingdom. And in the time of this Gotholia, Elis&aelig;us was still prophesying. And after her reigned, as I said before, Joash, rescued by Josab&aelig;a the wife of Jod&aelig; the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and lived in all forty years.</p>

<p>There are comprised, then, from Solomon to the death of Elis&aelig;us the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, as some say, one hundred and five years; according to others, one hundred and two; and, as the chronology before us shows, from the reign of Solomon an hundred and eighty-one.</p>

<p>Now from the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the birth of Homer, according to Philochorus, a hundred and eighty years elapsed; and he was posterior to the Ionic migration. But Aristarchus, in the <em>Archilochian Memoirs</em>, says that he lived during the Ionic migration, which took place a hundred and twenty years after the siege of Troy. But Apollodorus alleges it was an hundred and twenty years after the Ionic migration, while Agesilaus son of Doryss&aelig;us was king of the Laced&aelig;monians: so that he brings Lycurgus the legislator, while still a young man, near him. Euthymenes, in the <em>Chronicles</em>, says that he flourished contemporaneously with Hesiod, in the time of Acastus, and was born in Chios about the four hundredth year after the capture of Troy. And Archimachus, in the third book of his <em>Eub&oelig;an History</em>, is of this opinion. So that both he and Hesiod were later than Elis&aelig;us, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And if you choose to follow the grammarian Crates, and say that Homer was born about the time of the expedition of the Heraclid&aelig;, eighty years after the taking of Troy, he will be found to be later again than Solomon, in whose days occurred the arrival of Menelaus in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, as was said above. Eratosthenes says that Homer's age was two hundred years after the capture of Troy. Further, Theopompus, in the forty-third book of the <em>Philippics</em>, relates that Homer was born five hundred years after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at Troy. And Euphorion, in his book about the <em>Aleuades</em>, maintains that he was born in the time of Gyges, who began to reign in the eighteenth Olympiad, who, also he says, was the first that was called tyrant (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>). Sosibius Lacon, again, in his <em>Record of Dates</em>, brings Homer down to the eighth year of the reign of Charillus the son of Polydectus. Charillus reigned for sixty-four years, after whom the son of Nicander reigned thirty-nine years. In his thirty-fourth year it is said that the first Olympiad was instituted; so that Homer was ninety years before the introduction of the Olympic games.</p>

<p>After Joas, Amasias his son reigned as his successor thirty-nine years. He in like manner was succeeded by his son Ozias, who reigned for fifty-two years, and died a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>. And in his time prophesied Amos, and Isaiah his son,  and Hosea the son of Beeri, and Jonas the son of Amathi, who was of Geth-chober, who preached to the Ninevites, and passed through the whale's belly.</p>

<p>Then Jonathan the son of Ozias reigned for sixteen years. In his time Esaias still prophesied, and Hosea, and Mich&aelig;as the Morasthite, and Joel the son of Bethuel.</p>

<p>Next in succession was his son Ahaz, who reigned for sixteen years. In his time, in the fifteenth year, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was carried away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. And Salmanasar the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> carried away the people of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> into the country of the Medes and to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</p>

<p>Again Ahaz was succeeded by Osee,  who reigned for eight years. Then followed Hezekiah, for twenty-nine years. For his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, when he had approached his end, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, allowed him to live for other fifteen years, giving as a sign the going back of the sun. Up to his times Esaias, Hosea, and Micah continued prophesying.</p>

<p>And these are said to have lived after the age of Lycurgus, the legislator of the Laced&aelig;monians. For Dieuchidas, in the fourth book of the <em>Megarics</em>, places the era of Lycurgus about the two hundred and ninetieth year after the capture of Troy.</p>

<p>After Hezekiah, his son Manasses reigned for fifty-five years. Then his son Amos for two years. After him reigned his son Josias, distinguished for his observance of the law, for thirty-one years. He <q>laid the carcasses of men upon the carcasses of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> as is written in the book of Leviticus. <span class="stiki" id="note022056"><a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse30">Leviticus&nbsp;26:30</a></span> In his reign, in the eighteenth year, the passover was celebrated, not having been kept from the days of Samuel in the intervening period. <span class="stiki" id="note022057"><a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#verse22">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:22</a></span> Then Chelkias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the father of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah, having fallen in with the book of the law, that had been laid up in the temple, read it and died. <span class="stiki" id="note022058"><a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:8</a></span> And in his days Olda  prohesied, and Sophonias,  and Jeremiah. And in the days of Jeremiah was Ananias the son of Azor,  the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>. He  having disobeyed <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, was slain by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> Necho king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the river Euphrates, having encountered the latter, who was marching on the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</p>

<p>Josiah was succeeded by Jechoniah, called also Joachas,  his son, who reigned three months and ten days. Necho king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> bound him and led him to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, after making his brother Joachim king in his stead, who continued his tributary for eleven years. After him his namesake  Joakim reigned for three months. Then Zedekiah reigned for eleven years; and up to his time Jeremiah continued to prophesy. Along with him Ezekiel  the son of Buzi, and Urias  the son of Sam&aelig;us, and Ambacum  prophesied. Here end the Hebrew kings.</p>

<p>There are then from the birth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> till this captivity nine hundred and seventy-two years; but according to strict chronological accuracy, one thousand and eighty-five, six months, ten days. From the reign of David to the captivity by the Chaldeans, four hundred and fifty-two years and six months; but as the accuracy we have observed in reference to dates makes out, four hundred and eighty-two and six months ten days.</p>

<p>And in the twelfth year of the reign of Zedekiah, forty years before the supremacy of the Persians, Nebuchodonosor made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Ph&oelig;nicians and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as Berosus asserts in his <em>Chald&aelig;an Histories</em>. And Joabas,  writing about the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, acknowledges that he had received the history from Berosus, and testifies to his accuracy. Nebuchodonosor, therefore, having put out the eyes of Zedekiah, took him away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and transported the whole people (the captivity lasted seventy years), with the exception of a few who fled to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>Jeremiah and Ambacum were still prophesying in the time of Zedekiah. In the fifth year of his reign Ezekiel prophesied at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; after him Nahum, then Daniel. After him, again, Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in the time of Darius the First for two years; and then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> among the twelve.  After Haggai and Zechariah, Nehemiah, the chief cup-bearer of Artaxerxes, the son of Acheli the Israelite, built the city of Jerusalem and restored the temple. During the captivity lived Esther and Mordecai, whose book is still extant, as also that of the Maccabees. During this captivity Mishael, Ananias, and Azarias, refusing to worship the image, and being thrown into a furnace of fire, were saved by the appearance of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. At that time, on account of the serpent,  Daniel was thrown into the den of lions; but being preserved through the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God by Ambacub, he is restored on the seventh day. At this period, too, occurred the sign of Jona; and Tobias, through the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Raphael, married Sarah, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> having killed her seven first suitors; and after the marriage of Tobias, his father Tobit recovered his sight. At that time Zorobabel, having by his wisdom overcome his opponents, and obtained leave from Darius for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, returned with Esdras to his native land; and by him the redemption of the people and the revisal and restoration of the inspired oracles were effected; and the passover of deliverance celebrated, and marriage with aliens dissolved.</p>

<p>Cyrus had, by proclamation, previously enjoined the restoration of the Hebrews. And his promise being accomplished in the time of Darius, the feast of the dedication was held, as also the feast of tabernacles.</p>

<p>There were in all, taking in the duration of the captivity down to the restoration of the people, from the birth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, one thousand one hundred and fifty-five years, six months, and ten days; and from the reign of David, according to some, four hundred and fifty-two; more correctly, five hundred and seventy-two years, six months, and ten days.</p>

<p>From the captivity at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, which took place in the time of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, was fulfilled what was spoken by Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as follows: <q>Seventy weeks are determined upon your people, and upon your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, to finish the transgression, and to seal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to wipe out and make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. Know therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the word commanding an answer to be given, and Jerusalem to be built, to Christ the Prince, are seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; and the street shall be again built, and the wall; and the times shall be expended. And after the sixty-two weeks the anointing shall be overthrown, and judgment shall not be in him; and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary along with the coming Prince. And they shall be destroyed in a flood, and to the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> shall be cut off by desolations. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the middle of the week the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and oblation shall be taken away; and in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place shall be the abomination of desolations, and until the consummation of time shall the consummation be assigned for desolation. And in the midst of the week shall he make the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> cease, and of the wing of destruction, even till the consummation, like the destruction of the oblation.</q>  That the temple accordingly was built in seven weeks, is evident; for it is written in Esdras. And thus Christ became King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, reigning in Jerusalem in the fulfilment of the seven weeks. And in the sixty and two weeks the whole of Jud&aelig;a was quiet, and without <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. And Christ our Lord, <q>the Holy of Holies,</q> having come and fulfilled the vision and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, was anointed in His flesh by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of His Father. In those <q>sixty and two weeks,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, and <q>in the one week,</q> was He Lord. The half of the week <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> held sway, and in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem placed the abomination; and in the half of the week he was taken away, and Otho, and Galba, and Vitellius. And <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> rose to the supreme power, and destroyed Jerusalem, and desolated the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. And that such are the facts of the case, is clear to him that is able to understand, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said.</p>

<p>On the completion, then, of the eleventh year, in the beginning of the following, in the reign of Joachim, occurred the carrying away captive to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> by Nabuchodonosor the king, in the seventh year of his reign over the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, in the second year of the reign of Vaphres over the Egyptians, in the archonship of Philip at Athens, in the first year of the forty-eighth Olympiad. The captivity lasted for seventy years, and ended in the second year of Darius Hystaspes, who had become king of the Persians, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and Egyptians; in whose reign, as I said above, Haggai and Zechariah and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the twelve prophesied. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> was Joshua the son of Josedec. And in the second year of the reign of Darius, who, Herodotus says, destroyed the power of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel was dispatched to raise and adorn the temple at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The times of the Persians are accordingly summed up thus: Cyrus reigned thirty years; Cambyses, nineteen; Darius, forty-six; Xerxes, twenty-six; Artaxerxes, forty-one; Darius, eight; Artaxerxes, forty-two; Ochus or Arses, three. The sum total of the years of the Persian monarchy is two hundred and thirty-five years.</p>

<p>Alexander of Macedon, having dispatched this Darius, during this period, began to reign. Similarly, therefore, the times of the Macedonian kings are thus computed: Alexander, eighteen years; Ptolemy the son of Lagus, forty years; Ptolemy Philadelphus, twenty-seven years; then Euergetes, five-and-twenty years; then Philopator, seventeen years; then Epiphanes, four-and-twenty years; he was succeeded by Philometer, who reigned five-and-thirty years; after him Physcon, twenty-nine years; then Lathurus, thirty-six years; then he that was surnamed Dionysus, twenty-nine years; and last Cleopatra reigned twenty-two years. And after her was the reign of the Cappadocians for eighteen days.</p>

<p>Accordingly the period embraced by the Macedonian kings is, in all, three hundred and twelve years and eighteen days.</p>

<p>Therefore those who prophesied in the time of Darius Hystaspes, about the second year of his reign&mdash;Haggai, and Zechariah, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the twelve, who prophesied about the first year of the forty-eighth Olympiad,&mdash; are demonstrated to be older than Pythagoras, who is said to have lived in the sixty-second Olympiad, and than Thales, the oldest of the wise men of the Greeks, who lived about the fiftieth Olympiad. Those wise men that are classed with Thales were then contemporaneous, as Andron says in the <em>Tripos</em>. For Heraclitus being posterior to Pythagoras, mentions him in his book. Whence indisputably the first Olympiad, which was demonstrated to be four hundred and seven years later than the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, is found to be prior to the age of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, together with those called the seven wise men. Accordingly it is easy to perceive that Solomon, who lived in the time of Menelaus (who was during the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>), was earlier by many years than the wise men among the Greeks. And how many years <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> preceded him we showed, in what we said above. And Alexander, surnamed Polyhistor, in his work on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, has transcribed some letters of Solomon to Vaphres king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and to the king of the Ph&oelig;nicians at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and theirs to Solomon; in which it is shown that Vaphres sent eighty thousand <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> men to him for the building of the temple, and the other as many, along with a Tyrian artificer, the son of a Jewish mother, of the tribe of Dan,  as is there written, of the name of Hyperon.  Further, Onomacritus the Athenian, who is said to have been the author of the poems ascribed to Orpheus, is ascertained to have lived in the reign of the Pisistratid&aelig;, about the fiftieth Olympiad. And Orpheus, who sailed with Hercules, was the pupil of Mus&aelig;us. Amphion precedes the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by two generations. And Demodocus and Phemius were posterior to the capture of Troy; for they were famed for playing on the lyre, the former among the Ph&aelig;acians, and the latter among the suitors. And the <em>Oracles </em>ascribed to Mus&aelig;us are said to be the production of Onomacritus, and the <em>Crateres </em>of Orpheus the production of Zopyrus of Heraclea, and <em>The Descent to Hades </em>that of Prodicus of Samos. Ion of Chios relates in the <em>Triagmi</em>,  that Pythagoras ascribed certain works [of his own] to Orpheus. Epigenes, in his book respecting <em>The Poetry attributed to Orpheus</em>, says that <em>The Descent to Hades</em> and the <em>Sacred Discourse</em> were the production of Cecrops the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>; and the <em>Peplus</em> and the <em>Physics</em> of Brontinus. Some also make Terpander out ancient. Hellanicus, accordingly, relates that he lived in the time of Midas: but Phanias, who places Lesches the Lesbian before Terpander, makes Terpander younger than Archilochus, and relates that Lesches contended with Arctinus, and gained the victory. Xanthus the Lydian says that he lived about the eighteenth Olympiad; as also Dionysius says that Thasus was built about the fifteenth Olympiad: so that it is clear that Archilochus  was already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> after the twentieth Olympiad. He accordingly relates the destruction of Magnetes as having recently taken place. Simonides is assigned to the time of Archilochus. Callinus is not much older; for Archilochus refers to Magnetes as destroyed, while the latter refers to it as flourishing. Eumelus of Corinth being older, is said to have met Archias, who founded Syracuse.</p>

<p>We were induced to mention these things, because the poets of the epic cycle are placed among those of most remote antiquity. Already, too, among the Greeks, many <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> are said to have made their appearance, as the Bacides, one a B&oelig;otian, the other an Arcadian, who uttered many predictions to many. By the counsel of Amphiletus the Athenian,  who showed the time for the onset, Pisistratus, too, strengthened his government. For we may pass over in silence Cometes of Crete, Cinyras of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, Admetus the Thessalian, Arist&aelig;as the Cyrenian, Amphiaraus the Athenian, Timoxeus  the Corcyr&aelig;an, Dem&aelig;netus the Phocian, Epigenes the Thespian, Nicias the Carystian, Aristo the Thessalian, Dionysius the Carthaginian, Cleophon the Corinthian, Hippo the daughter of Chiro, and B&oelig;o, and Manto, and the host of Sibyls, the Samian, the Colophonian, the Cum&aelig;an, the Erythr&aelig;an, the Pythian,  the Taraxandrian, the Macetian, the Thessalian, and the Thesprotian. And Calchas again, and Mopsus, who lived during the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Mopsus, however, was older, having sailed along with the Argonants. And it is said that Battus the Cyrenian composed what is called <em>the Divination</em> of Mopsus. Dorotheus in the first <em>Pandect</em> relates that Mopsus was the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Alcyon and Corone. And Pythagoras the Great always applied his mind to prognostication, and Abaris the Hyperborean, and Arist&aelig;as the Proconnesian, and Epimenides the Cretan, who came to Sparta, and Zoroaster the Mede, and Empedocles of Agrigentum, and Phormion the Laced&aelig;monian; Polyaratus, too, of Thasus, and Empedotimus of Syracuse; and in addition to these, Socrates the Athenian in particular. <q>For,</q> he says in the <em>Theages</em>, <q>I am attended by a supernatural intimation, which has been assigned me from a child by divine appointment. This is a voice which, when it comes, prevents what I am about to do, but exhorts never.</q>  And Execestus, the tyrant of the Phocians, wore two enchanted rings, and by the sound which they uttered one against the other determined the proper times for actions. But he died, nevertheless, treacherously murdered, although warned beforehand by the sound, as Aristotle says in the <em>Polity of the Phocians</em>.</p>

<p>Of those, too, who at one time lived as men among the Egyptians, but were constituted gods by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion, were Hermes the Theban, and Asclepius of Memphis; Tireseus and Manto, again, at Thebes, as Euripides says. Helenus, too, and Laoco&ouml;n, and &OElig;none, and Crenus in Ilium. For Crenus, one of the Heraclid&aelig;, is said to have been a noted <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Another was Jamus in Elis, from whom came the Jamid&aelig;; and Polyidus at Argos and Megara, who is mentioned by the tragedy. Why enumerate Telemus, who, being a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Cyclops, predicted to Polyphemus the events of Ulysses' wandering; or Onomacritus at Athens; or Amphiaraus, who campaigned with the seven at Thebes, and is reported to be a generation older than the capture of Troy; or Theoclymenus in Cephalonia, or Telmisus in Caria, or Galeus in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>?</p>

<p>There are others, too, besides these: Idmon, who was with the Argonauts, Phemonoe of Delphi, Mopsus the son of Apollo and Manto in Pamphylia, and Amphilochus the son of Amphiaraus in Cilicia, Alcm&aelig;on among the Acarnanians, Anias in Delos, Aristander of Telmessus, who was along with Alexander. Philochorus also relates in the first book of the work, <em>On Divination</em>, that Orpheus was a seer. And Theopompus, and Ephorus, and Tim&aelig;us, write of a seer called Orthagoras; as the Samian Pythocles in the fourth book of <em>The Italics</em> writes of Caius Julius Nepos.</p>

<p>But some of these <q>thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>,</q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, predicted for the most part from observation and probabilities, as physicians and soothsayers judge from natural signs; and others were excited by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or were disturbed by waters, and fumigations, and air of a peculiar kind. But among the Hebrews the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were moved by the power and inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Before the law, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> spoke <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> in respect to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and the naming of the creatures; <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> preached repentance;  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob gave many clear utterances respecting future and present things. Contemporaneous with the law, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>; and after these prophesied Jesus the son of Nave, Samuel, Gad, Nathan, Achias, Sam&aelig;as, Jehu, Elias, Mich&aelig;as, Abdiu, Elis&aelig;us, Abbadonai, Amos, Esaias, Osee, Jonas, Joel, Jeremias, Sophonias the son of Buzi, Ezekiel, Urias, Ambacum, Naum, Daniel, Misael, who wrote the syllogisms, Aggai, Zacharias, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> among the twelve. These are, in all, five-and-thirty <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (for these too prophesied), Sara, and Rebecca, and Mariam, and Debbora, and Olda, i.e., Huldah.</p>

<p>Then within the same period John prophesied till the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;  and after the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Anna and Simeon.  For Zacaharias, John's father, is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to have prophesied before his son. Let us then draw up the chronology of the Greeks from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p>

<p>From the birth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the exodus of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, eighty years; and the period down to his death, other forty years. The exodus took place in the time of Inachus, before the wandering of Sothis,  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> having gone forth from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> three hundred and forty-five years before. From the rule of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and from Inachus to the flood of Deucalion, I mean the second inundation, and to the conflagration of Phaethon, which events happened in the time of Crotopus, forty generations are enumerated (three generations being reckoned for a century). From the flood to the conflagration of Ida, and the discovery of iron, and the Id&aelig;an Dactyls, are seventy-three years, according to Thrasyllus; and from the conflagration of Ida to the rape of Ganymede, sixty-five years. From this to the expedition of Perseus, when Glaucus established the Isthmian games in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Melicerta, fifteen years; and from the expedition of Perseus to the building of Troy, thirty-four years. From this to the voyage of the Argo, sixty-four years. From this to Theseus and the Minotaur, thirty-two years; then to the seven at Thebes, ten years. And to the Olympic contest, which Hercules instituted in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Pelops, three years; and to the expedition of the Amazons against Athens, and the rape of Helen by Theseus, nine years. From this to the deification of Hercules, eleven years; then to the rape of Helen by Alexander, four years. From the taking of Troy to the descent of &AElig;neas and the founding of Lavinium, ten years; and to the government of Ascanius, eight years; and to the descent of the Heraclid&aelig;, sixty-one years; and to the Olympiad of Iphitus, three hundred and thirty-eight years. Eratosthenes thus sets down the dates: <q>From the capture of Troy to the descent of the Heraclid&aelig;, eighty years. From this to the founding of Ionia, sixty years; and the period following to the protectorate of Lycurgus, a hundred and fifty-nine years; and to the first year of the first Olympiad, a hundred and eight years. From which Olympiad to the invasion of Xerxes, two hundred and ninety-seven years; from which to the beginning of the Peloponnesian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, forty-eight years; and to its close, and the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, twenty-seven years; and to the battle at Leuctra, thirty-four years; after which to the death of Philip, thirty-five years. And after this to the decease of Alexander, twelve years.</q></p>

<p>Again, from the first Olympiad, some say, to the building of Rome, are comprehended twenty-four years; and after this to the expulsion of the kings,  when consuls were created, about two hundred and forty-three years. And from the taking of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> to the death of Alexander, a hundred and eighty-six years. From this to the victory of Augustus, when Antony killed himself at Alexandria, two hundred and ninety-four years, when Augustus was made consul for the fourth time. And from this time to the games which <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> instituted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, are a hundred and fourteen years; and from the first games to the death of Commodus, a hundred and eleven years.</p>

<p>There are some that from Cecrops to Alexander of Macedon reckon a thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight years; and from Demophon, a thousand two hundred and fifty; and from the taking of Troy to the expedition of the Heraclid&aelig;, a hundred and twenty or a hundred and eighty years. From this to the archonship of Ev&aelig;netus at Athens, in whose time Alexander is said to have marched into Asia, according to Phanias, are seven hundred and fifty years; according to Ephorus, seven hundred and thirty-five; according to Tim&aelig;us and Clitarchus, eight hundred and twenty; according to Eratosthenes, seven hundred and seventy-four. As also Duris, from the taking of Troy to the march of Alexander into Asia, a thousand years; and from that to the archonship of Hegesias, in whose time Alexander died eleven years. From this date to the reign of Germanicus Claudius C&aelig;sar, three hundred and sixty-five years. From which time the years summed up to the death of Commodus are manifest.</p>

<p>After the Grecian period, and in accordance with the dates, as computed by the barbarians, very large intervals are to be assigned.</p>

<p>From <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the deluge are comprised two thousand one hundred and forty-eight years, four days. From <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, a thousand two hundred and fifty years. From Isaac to the division of the land, six hundred and sixteen years. Then from the judges to Samuel, four hundred and sixty-three years, seven months. And after the judges there were five hundred and seventy-two years, six months, ten days of kings.</p>

<p>After which periods, there were two hundred and thirty-five years of the Persian monarchy. Then of the Macedonian, till the death of Antony, three hundred and twelve years and eighteen days. After which time, the empire of the Romans, till the death of Commodus, lasted for two hundred and twenty-two years.</p>

<p>Then, from the seventy years' captivity, and the restoration of the people into their own land to the captivity in the time of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, are comprised four hundred and ten years. Finally, from <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> to the death of Commodus, there are ascertained to be one hundred and twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-four days.</p>

<p>Demetrius, in his book, <em>On the Kings in Jud&aelig;a</em>, says that the tribes of Juda, Benjamin, and Levi were not taken captive by Sennacherim; but that there were from this captivity to the last, which Nabuchodonosor made out of Jerusalem, a hundred and twenty-eight years and six months; and from the time that the ten tribes were carried captive from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> till Ptolemy the Fourth, were five hundred and seventy-three years, nine months; and from the time that the captivity from Jerusalem took place, three hundred and thirty-eight years and three months.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> himself set down the kings differently from Demetrius.</p>

<p>Besides, Eupolemus, in a similar work, says that all the years from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the fifth year of Ptolemy Demetrius, who reigned twelve years in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when added, amount to five thousand a hundred and forty-nine; and from the time that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought out the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to the above-mentioned date, there are, in all, two thousand five hundred and eighty years. And from this time till the consulship in Rome of Caius <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> and Casian, a hundred and twenty years are computed.</p>

<p>Euphorus and many other historians say that there are seventy-five nations and tongues, in consequence of hearing the statement made by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>All the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that sprang from Jacob, which went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were seventy-five.</q>  According to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reckoning, there appear to be seventy-two generic dialects, as our Scriptures hand down. The rest of the vulgar tongues are formed by the blending of two, or three, or more dialects. A dialect is a mode of speech which exhibits a character peculiar to a locality, or a mode of speech which exhibits a character peculiar or common to a race. The Greeks say, that among them are five dialects&mdash; the Attic, Ionic, Doric, &AElig;olic, and the fifth the Common; and that the languages of the barbarians, which are innumerable, are not called dialects, but tongues.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> attributes a dialect also to the gods, forming this conjecture mainly from dreams and oracles, and especially from <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, who do not speak their own language or dialect, but that of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who have taken possession of them. He thinks also that the irrational creatures have dialects, which those that belong to the same genus understand.  Accordingly, when an elephant falls into the mud and bellows out any other one that is at hand, on seeing what has happened, shortly turns, and brings with him a herd of elephants, and saves the one that has fallen in. It is said also in Libya, that a scorpion, if it does not succeed in stinging a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, goes away and returns with several more; and that, hanging on one to the other like a chain they make in this way the attempt to succeed in their cunning design.</p>

<p>The irrational creatures do not make use of an obscure intimation, or hint their meaning by assuming a particular attitude, but, as I think, by a dialect of their own.  And some others say, that if a fish which has been taken escape by breaking the line, no fish of the same kind will be caught in the same place that day. But the first and generic barbarous dialects have terms by nature, since also men confess that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> uttered in a barbarian tongue are more powerful. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in the <em>Cratylus</em>, when wishing to interpret <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1FE6;&#x03C1;</span> (<em>fire</em>), says that it is a barbaric term. He testifies, accordingly, that the Phrygians use this term with a slight deviation.</p>

<p>And nothing, in my opinion, after these details, need stand in the way of stating the periods of the Roman emperors, in order to the demonstration of the Saviour's birth. Augustus, forty-three years; <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, twenty-two years; Caius, four years; Claudius, fourteen years; <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, fourteen years; Galba, one year; <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, ten years; Titus, three years; <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, fifteen years; Nerva, one year; <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, nineteen years; Adrian, twenty-one years; <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, twenty-one years; likewise again, <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Antoninus</a> and Commodus, thirty-two. In all, from Augustus to Commodus, are two hundred and twenty-two years; and from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the death of Commodus, five thousand seven hundred and eighty-four years, two months, twelve days.</p>

<p>Some set down the dates of the Roman emperors thus:&mdash; </p>

<p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar, three years, four months, five days; after him Augustus reigned forty-six years, four months, one day. Then <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, twenty-six years, six months, nineteen days. He was succeeded by Caius C&aelig;sar, who reigned three years, ten months, eight days; and he by Claudius for thirteen years, eight months, twenty-eight days. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> reigned thirteen years, eight months, twenty-eight days; Galba, seven months and six days; Otho, five months, one day; Vitellius, seven months, one day; <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, eleven years, eleven months, twenty-two days; Titus, two years, two months; <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, fifteen years, eight months, five days; Nerva, one year, four months, ten days; <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, nineteen years, seven months, ten days; Adrian, twenty years, ten months, twenty-eight days. <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, twenty-two years, three months, and seven days; <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</a>, nineteen years, eleven days; Commodus, twelve years, nine months, fourteen days.</p>

<p>From Julius C&aelig;sar, therefore, to the death of Commodus, are two hundred and thirty-six years, six months. And the whole from Romulus, who founded Rome, till the death of Commodus, amounts to nine hundred and fifty-three years, six months. And our Lord was born in the twenty-eighth year, when first the census was ordered to be taken in the reign of Augustus. And to prove that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by Luke as follows: <q>And in the fifteenth year, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zacharias.</q> And again in the same book: <q>And Jesus was coming to His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, being about thirty years old,</q>  and so on. And that it was necessary for Him to preach only a year, this also is written:  <q>He has sent Me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord .</q> This both the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Accordingly, in fifteen years of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> and fifteen years of Augustus; so were completed the thirty years till the time He suffered. And from the time that He suffered till the destruction of Jerusalem are forty-two years and three months; and from the destruction of Jerusalem to the death of Commodus, a hundred and twenty-eight years, ten months, and three days. From the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, to the death of Commodus are, in all, a hundred and ninety-four years, one month, thirteen days. And there are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord's birth, but also the day; and they say that it took place in the twenty-eighth year of Augustus, and in the twenty-fifth day of Pachon. And the followers of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> hold the day of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a festival, spending the night before in readings.</p>

<p>And they say that it was the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, the fifteenth day of the month Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of the same month. And treating of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, with very great accuracy, some say that it took place in the sixteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, on the twenty-fifth of Phamenoth; and others the twenty-fifth of Pharmuthi and others say that on the nineteenth of Pharmuthi the Saviour suffered. Further, others say that He was born on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of Pharmuthi. </p>

<p>We have still to add to our chronology the following&mdash;I mean the days which Daniel indicates from the desolation of Jerusalem, the seven years and seven months of the reign of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>. For the two years are added to the seventeen months and eighteen days of Otho, and Galba, and Vitellius; and the result is three years and six months, which is <q>the half of the week,</q> as Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said. For he said that there were two thousand three hundred days from the time that the abomination of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> stood in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, till its destruction. For thus the declaration, which is subjoined, shows: <q>How long shall be the vision, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> taken away, the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, which is given, and the power and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place shall be trodden under foot? And he said to him, Till the evening and morning, two thousand three hundred days, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place shall be taken away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022091"><a href="../bible/dan008.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;8:13-14</a></span> </p>

<p>These two thousand three hundred days, then, make six years four months, during the half of which <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> held sway, and it was half a week; and for a half, <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> with Otho, Galba, and Vitellius reigned. And on this account Daniel says, <q>Blessed is he that comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022092"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse12">Daniel&nbsp;12:12</a></span> For up to these days was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and after them it ceased. And this number is demonstrated from a subsequent chapter, which is as follows: <q>And from the time of the change of continuation, and of the giving of the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022093"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse11">Daniel&nbsp;12:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a> the Jew, who composed the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, computing the periods, says that from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to David were five hundred and eighty-five years; from David to the second year of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, a thousand one hundred and seventy-nine; then from that to the tenth year of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, seventy-seven. So that from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the tenth year of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a> there are, in all, two thousand one hundred and thirty-three years.</p>

<p>Of others, counting from Inachus and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the death of Commodus, some say there were three thousand one hundred and forty-two years; and others, two thousand eight hundred and thirty-one years.</p>

<p>And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew, the genealogy which begins with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is continued down to Mary the mother of the Lord. <q>For,</q> it is said, <span class="stiki" id="note022094"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;1:17</a></span> <q>from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the carrying away into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> till Christ are likewise other fourteen generations,</q>&mdash; three mystic intervals completed in six weeks. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22. On the Greek Translation of the Old Testament</h2>

<p>So much for the details respecting dates, as stated variously by many, and as set down by us.</p>

<p>It is said that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> both of the law and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were translated from the dialect of the Hebrews into the Greek language in the reign of Ptolemy the son of Lagos, or, according to others, of Ptolemy surnamed Philadelphus; Demetrius Phalereus bringing to this task the greatest earnestness, and employing painstaking accuracy on the materials for the translation. For the Macedonians being still in possession of Asia, and the king being ambitious of adorning the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> he had at Alexandria with all writings, desired the people of Jerusalem to translate the prophecies they possessed into the Greek dialect. And they being the subjects of the Macedonians, selected from those of highest character among them seventy elders, versed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and skilled in the Greek dialect, and sent them to him with the divine books. And each having severally translated each prophetic book, and all the translations being compared together, they agreed both in meaning and expression. For it was the counsel of God carried out for the benefit of Grecian ears. It was not alien to the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, also to produce the translation, and make it as it were Greek <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> having perished in the captivity of Nabuchodonosor, Esdras  the Levite, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, having become inspired in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> restored again the whole of the ancient Scriptures. And Aristobulus, in his first book addressed to Philometor, writes in these words: <q>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> given to us, and had manifestly studied all that is said in them.</q> And before Demetrius there had been translated by another, previous to the dominion of Alexander and of the Persians, the account of the departure of our countrymen the Hebrews from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the fame of all that happened to them, and their taking possession of the land, and the account of the whole code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; so that it is perfectly clear that the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> derived a great deal from this source, for he was very learned, as also Pythagoras, who transferred many things from our books to his own system of doctrines. And Numenius, the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, expressly writes: <q>For what is <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaking in Attic Greek?</q> This <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a theologian and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and as some say, an interpreter of sacred <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and life, are related by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, which are worthy of all credit; but have nevertheless to be stated by us also as well as we can. </p>

<h2>Chapter 23. The Age, Birth, and Life of Moses</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, originally of a Chaldean  <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, was born in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, his ancestors having migrated from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> on account of a protracted famine. Born in the seventh generation,  and having received a royal education, the following are the circumstances of his history. The Hebrews having increased in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to a great multitude, and the king of the country being afraid of insurrection in consequence of their numbers, he ordered all the female children born to the Hebrews to be reared (<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being unfit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>), but the male to be destroyed, being suspicious of stalwart youth. But the child being goodly, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> nursed him secretly three months, natural affection being too strong for the monarch's cruelty. But at last, dreading lest they should be destroyed along with the child, they made a basket of the papyrus that grew there, put the child in it, and laid it on the banks of the marshy river. The child's sister stood at a distance, and watched what would happen. In this emergency, the king's daughter, who for a long time had not been pregnant, and who longed for a child, came that day to the river to bathe and wash herself; and hearing the child cry, she ordered it to be brought to her; and touched with pity, sought a nurse. At that moment the child's sister ran up, and said that, if she wished, she could procure for her as nurse one of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had recently had a child. And on her consenting and desiring her to do so, she brought the child's mother to be nurse for a stipulated fee, as if she had been some other person. Thereupon the queen gave the babe the name of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, with etymological propriety, from his being drawn out of <q>the water,</q> &mdash; for the Egyptians call water <q>mou,</q>&mdash; in which he had been exposed to die. For they call <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> one who <q>who breathed [on being taken] from the water.</q> It is clear that previously the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> gave a name to the child on his <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and he was called Joachim. And he had a third name in heaven, after his ascension,  as the mystics say&mdash; Melchi. Having reached the proper age, he was taught arithmetic, geometry, poetry, harmony, and besides, medicine and music, by those that excelled in these arts among the Egyptians; and besides, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which is conveyed by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, which they point out in the hieroglyphical inscriptions. The rest of the usual course of instruction, Greeks taught him in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> as a royal child, as <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> says in his life of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. He learned, besides, the literature of the Egyptians, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the heavenly bodies from the Chaldeans and the Egyptians; whence in the Acts <span class="stiki" id="note022102"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;7:22</a></span> he is said <q>to have been instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.</q> And Eupolemus, in his book <em>On the Kings in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a></em>, says that <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was the first wise man, and the first that imparted grammar to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that the Ph&oelig;nicians received it from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the Greeks from the Ph&oelig;nicians.</q> And betaking himself to their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  he increased his wisdom, being ardently attached to the training received from his kindred and ancestors, till he struck and slew the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> who wrongfully attacked the Hebrew. And the mystics say that he slew the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> by a word only; as, certainly, Peter in the Acts is related to have slain by speech those who appropriated part of the price of the field, and lied. <span class="stiki" id="note022104"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;5:1</a></span> And so Artapanus, in his work <em>On the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, relates <q>that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, being shut up in custody by Chenephres, king of the Egyptians, on account of the people demanding to be let go from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> being opened by night, by the interposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, went forth, and reaching the palace, stood before the king as he slept, and aroused him; and that the latter, struck with what had taken place, bade <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> tell him the name of the God who had sent him; and that he, bending forward, told him in his ear; and that the king on hearing it fell speechless, but being supported by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, revived again.</q> And respecting the education of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, we shall find a harmonious account in Ezekiel,  the composer of Jewish tragedies in the drama entitled <em>The Exodus</em>. He thus writes in the person of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For, seeing our race abundantly increase, <br>His treacherous snares King <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> 'gainst us laid, <br>And cruelly in brick-kilns some of us, <br>And some, in toilsome works of building, plagued. <br>And towns and towers by toil of ill-starred men <br>He raised. Then to the Hebrew race proclaimed, <br>That each male child should in deep-flowing Nile <br>Be drowned. My mother bore and hid me then <br>Three months (so afterwards she told). Then took, <br>And me adorned with fair array, and placed <br>On the deep sedgy marsh by Nilus bank, <br>While Miriam, my sister, watched afar. <br>Then, with her maids, the daughter of the king, <br>To bathe her beauty in the cleansing stream,  <br>Came near, straight saw, and took and raised me up; <br>And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> me for a Hebrew. Miriam <br>My sister to the princess ran, and said, <br>'Is it your pleasure, that I haste and find <br>A nurse for you to rear this child <br>Among the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>?' The princess <br>Gave assent. The maiden to her mother sped, <br>And told, who quick appeared. My own <br>Dear mother took me in her arms. Then said <br>The daughter of the king: 'Nurse me this child, <br>And I will give you wages.'And my name <br><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> she called, because she drew and saved <br>Me from the waters on the river's bank. <br>And when the days of childhood had flown by, <br>My mother brought me to the palace where <br>The princess dwelt, after disclosing all <br>About my ancestry, and God's great gifts. <br>In boyhood's years I royal nurture had, <br>And in all princely exercise was trained, <br>As if the princess's very son. But when <br>The circling days had run their course, <br>I left the royal palace.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then, after relating the combat between the Hebrew and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and the burying of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> in the sand, he says of the other contest:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Why strike one feebler than yourself? <br>And he rejoined: Who made you judge o'er us, <br>Or ruler? Will you slay me, as you slew<br>Him yesterday? And I in terror said, <br>How is this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he fled from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and fed sheep, being thus trained beforehand for pastoral rule. For the shepherd's life is a preparation for sovereignty in the case of him who is destined to rule over the peaceful flock of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as the chase for those who are by nature warlike. Thence God brought him to lead the Hebrews. Then the Egyptians, oft admonished, continued unwise; and the Hebrews were spectators of the calamities that others suffered, learning in safety the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when the Egyptians gave no heed to the effects of that power, through their foolish infatuation disbelieving, then, as is said, <q>the children <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a></q> what was done; and the Hebrews afterwards going forth, departed carrying much spoil from the Egyptians, not for <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, as the cavillers say, for God did not persuade them to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> what belonged to others. But, in the first place, they took wages for the services they had rendered the Egyptians all the time; and then in a way recompensed the Egyptians, by afflicting them in requital as avaricious, by the abstraction of the booty, as they had done the Hebrews by enslaving them. Whether, then, as may be alleged is done in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they thought it proper, in the exercise of the rights of conquerors, to take away the property of their enemies, as those who have gained the day do from those who are worsted (and there was just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of hostilities. The Hebrews came as suppliants to the Egyptians on account of famine; and they, reducing their guests to slavery, compelled them to serve them after the manner of captives, giving them no recompense); or as in peace, took the spoil as wages against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of those who for a long period had given them no recompense, but rather had <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> them, [it is all one.]</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. How Moses Discharged the Part of a Military Leader</h2>

<p>Our <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> then is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, a legislator, skilled in military tactics and strategy, a politician, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. And in what sense he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, shall be by and by told, when we come to treat of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Tactics belong to military command, and the ability to command an army is among the attributes of kingly rule. Legislation, again, is also one of the functions of the kingly office, as also judicial authority.</p>

<p>Of the kingly office one kind is divine,&mdash; that which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Son, by whom both the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are of the earth, and external and perfect felicity too, are supplied. <q>For,</q> it is said, <q>seek what is great, and the little things shall be added.</q>  And there is a second kind of royalty, inferior to that administration which is purely rational and divine, which brings to the task of government merely the high mettle of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; after which fashion Hercules ruled the Argives, and Alexander the Macedonians. The third kind is what aims after one thing&mdash; merely to conquer and overturn; but to turn conquest either to a good or a bad purpose, belongs not to such rule. Such was the aim of the Persians in their campaign against Greece. For, on the one hand, fondness for strife is solely the result of passion, and acquires power solely for the sake of domination; while, on the other, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of good is characteristic of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which uses its high spirit for noble ends. The fourth, the worst of all, is the sovereignty which acts according to the promptings of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as that of Sardanapalus, and those who propose to themselves as their end the gratification of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to the utmost. But the instrument of regal sway&mdash; the instrument at once of that which overcomes by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that which does so by force&mdash; is the power of managing (or tact). And it varies according to the nature and the material. In the case of arms and of fighting animals the ordering power is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by means animate and inanimate; and in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which we master by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, reason is the ordering power, by affixing the seal of continence and self-restraint, along with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and sound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, making the result of the whole to terminate in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards God. For it is wisdom which regulates in the case of those who so practice <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and divine things are ordered by wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs by politics&mdash; all things by the kingly faculty. He is a king, then, who governs according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and possesses the skill to sway willing subjects. Such is the Lord, who receives all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and by Him. For the Father has delivered and subjected all to Christ our King, <q>that at the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee may bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is Lord, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022107"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> </p>

<p>Now, generalship involves three ideas: caution, enterprise, and the union of the two. And each of these consists of three things, acting as they do either by word, or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or by both together. And all this can be accomplished either by persuasion, or by compulsion, or by inflicting harm in the way of taking vengeance on those who ought to be punished; and this either by doing what is right, or by telling what is untrue, or by telling what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or by adopting any of these means conjointly at the same time.</p>

<p>Now, the Greeks had the advantage of receiving from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> all these, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of how to make use of each of them. And, for the sake of example, I shall cite one or two instances of leadership. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, on leading the people forth, suspecting that the Egyptians would pursue, left the short and direct route, and turned to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and marched mostly by night. For it was another kind of arrangement by which the Hebrews were trained in the great wilderness, and for a protracted time, to belief in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one God alone, being inured by the wise discipline of endurance to which they were subjected. The strategy of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, therefore, shows the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of discerning what will be of service before the approach of dangers, and so to encounter them. It turned out precisely as he suspected, for the Egyptians pursued with horses and chariots, but were quickly destroyed by the sea breaking on them and overwhelming them with their horses and chariots, so that not a remnant of them was left. Afterwards the pillar of fire, which accompanied them (for it went before them as a guide), conducted the Hebrews by night through an untrodden region, training and bracing them, by toils and hardships, to manliness and endurance, that after their experience of what appeared formidable difficulties, the benefits of the land, to which from the trackless desert he was conducting them, might become apparent. Furthermore, he put to flight and slew the hostile occupants of the land, falling upon them from a desert and rugged line of march (such was the excellence of his generalship). For the taking of the land of those hostile tribes was a work of skill and strategy.</p>

<p>Perceiving this, Miltiades, the Athenian general, who conquered the Persians in battle at Marathon, imitated it in the following fashion. Marching over a trackless desert, he led on the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> by night, and eluded the barbarians that were set to watch him. For Hippias, who had deserted from the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, conducted the barbarians into Attica, and seized and held the points of vantage, in consequence of having a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the ground. The task was then to elude Hippias. Whence rightly Miltiades, traversing the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and attacking by night the Persians commanded by Dates, led his soldiers to victory.</p>

<p>But further, when Thrasybulus was bringing back the exiles from Phyla, and wished to elude observation, a pillar became his guide as he marched over a trackless region. To Thrasybulus by night, the sky being moonless and stormy, a fire appeared leading the way, which, having conducted them safely, left them near Munychia, where is now the altar of the light-bringer (Phosphorus).</p>

<p>From such an instance, therefore, let our accounts become credible to the Greeks, namely, that it was possible for the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God to make the pillar of fire, which was their guide on their march, go before the Hebrews by night. It is said also in a certain oracle,&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>A pillar to the Thebans is joy-inspiring Bacchus,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>from the history of the Hebrews. Also Euripides says, in <em>Antiope</em>&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>In the chambers within, the herdsman, <br>With chaplet of ivy, pillar of the Ev&oelig;an god.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The pillar indicates that God cannot be portrayed. The pillar of light, too, in addition to its pointing out that God cannot be represented, shows also the stability and the permanent duration of the Deity, and His unchangeable and inexpressible light. Before, then, the invention of the forms of images, the ancients erected pillars, and reverenced them as <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the Deity. Accordingly, he who composed the <em>Phoronis</em> writes&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Callithoe, key-bearer of the Olympian queen: <br>Argive Hera, who first with fillets and with fringes <br>The queen's tall column all around adorned.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Further, the author of <em>Europia </em>relates that the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Apollo at Delphi was a pillar in these words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>That to the god <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> we may <br>On sacred pillars and on lofty column hang.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Apollo, interpreted <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> by <q>privation of many,</q>  means the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>. Well, then, that fire like a pillar, and the fire in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light which passed through from earth and returned again to heaven, by the wood [of the cross], by which also the gift of intellectual vision was bestowed on us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Plato an Imitator of Moses in Framing Laws</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, aided in legislation by the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, censured the polity of Minos, and that of Lycurgus, as having <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> alone as their aim; while he praised as more seemly the polity which expresses some one thing, and directs according to one precept. For he says that it becomes us to philosophize with strength, and dignity, and wisdom&mdash;holding unalterably the same opinions about the same things, with reference to the dignity of heaven. Accordingly, therefore, he interprets what is in the law, enjoining us to look to one God and to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. Of politics, he says there are two kinds&mdash;the department of law, and that of politics, strictly so called.</p>

<p>And he refers to the Creator, as the Statesman (<span class="greek">&#x1F41; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>) by way of eminence, in his book of this name (<span class="greek">&#x1F41; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>); and those who lead an active and just life, combined with <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, he calls statesmen (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>). That department of politics which is called <q>Law,</q> he divides into administrative magnanimity and private good order, which he calls orderliness; and harmony, and sobriety, which are seen when rulers suit their subjects, and subjects are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to their rulers; a result which the system of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sedulously aims at effecting. Further, that the department of law is founded on generation, that of politics on friendship and consent, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, with the aid he received, affirms; and so, coupled with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in the <em>Epinomis</em>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the course of all generation, which takes place by the instrumentality of the planets; and the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, who was an astronomer and student of the motions of the stars, and of their sympathy and association with one another, he consequently joined to the <q>polity</q> (or <q>republic</q>). Then, in my opinion, the end both of the statesman, and of him who lives according to the law, is <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. It is necessary, therefore, that public affairs should be rightly managed. But to philosophize is best. For he who is wise will live concentrating all his energies on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, directing his life by good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, despising the opposite, and following the pursuits which contribute to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the law is not what is decided by law (for what is seen is not vision), nor every opinion (not certainly what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>). But law is the opinion which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is that which finds <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> being,</q> and attains to it. <q>He who is,</q>  says <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>sent me.</q> In accordance with which, namely, good opinion, some have called law, right reason, which enjoins what is to be done and forbids what is not to be done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Moses Rightly Called a Divine Legislator, And, Though Inferior to Christ, Far Superior to the Great Legislators of the Greeks, Minos and Lycurgus</h2>

<p>Whence the law was rightly said to have been given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, being a rule of right and wrong; and we may call it with accuracy the divine ordinance (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span> ), inasmuch as it was given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. It accordingly conducts to the divine. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>The law was instituted because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made.</q> Then, as if in explanation of his meaning, he adds: <q>But before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we were kept under the law, shut up,</q> manifestly through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <q>unto the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which should afterwards be revealed; so that the law was a schoolmaster to bring us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we should be justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> legislator is he who assigns to each department of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> what is suitable to it and to its operations. Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, to speak comprehensively, was a living law, governed by the benign Word. Accordingly, he furnished a good polity, which is the right discipline of men in social life. He also handled the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is that branch of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which deals with the correction of transgressors in the interests of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Co-ordinate with it is the faculty of dealing with punishments, which is a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the due measure to be observed in punishments. And punishment, in virtue of its being so, is the correction of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In a word, the whole system of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is suited for the training of such as are capable of becoming good and noble men, and for hunting out men like them; and this is the art of command. And that wisdom, which is capable of treating rightly those who have been caught by the Word, is legislative wisdom. For it is the property of this wisdom, being most kingly, to possess and use,</p>

<p>It is the wise man, therefore, alone whom the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> proclaim king, legislator, general, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, God-beloved. And if we discover these qualities in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as shown from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, we may, with the most assured persuasion, pronounce <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise. As then we say that it belongs to the shepherd's art to care for the sheep; for so <q>the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022112"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> so also we shall say that legislation,inasmuch as it presides over and cares for the flock of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, establishes the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by fanning into flame, as far as it can, what good there is in humanity.</p>

<p>And if the flock figuratively spoken of as belonging to the Lord is nothing but a flock of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, then He Himself is the good Shepherd and Lawgiver of the one flock, <q>of the sheep who hear Him,</q> the one who cares for them, <q>seeking,</q> and finding by the law and the word, <q>that which was lost;</q> since, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the law is spiritual and leads to felicity. For that which has arisen through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is spiritual. And he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a legislator, who not only announces what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and noble, but understands it. The law of this man who possesses <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the saving precept; or rather, the law is the precept of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the Word is <q>the power and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022113"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> Again, the expounder of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> is the same one by whom the law was given; the first expounder of the divine commands, who unveiled the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the only-begotten Son.</p>

<p>Then those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the law, since they have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, cannot disbelieve or be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But those who disbelieve, and have shown a repugnance to engage in the works of the law, whoever else may, certainly confess their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>What, then, is the unbelief of the Greeks? Is it not their unwillingness to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which declares that the law was divinely given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, while they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in their own writers? They relate that Minos received the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from Zeus in nine years, by frequenting the cave of Zeus; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Aristotle, and Ephorus write that Lycurgus was trained in legislation by going constantly to Apollo at Delphi. Cham&aelig;leo of Heraclea, in his book <em>On Drunkenness</em>, and Aristotle in <em>The Polity of Locrians</em>, mention that Zaleucus the Locrian received the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from Athene.</p>

<p>But those who exalt the credit of Greek legislation as far as in them lies, by referring it to a divine source, after the model of Mosaic <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, are senseless in not owning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the archetype of what is related among them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. The Law, Even in Correcting and Punishing, Aims at the Good of Men</h2>

<p>Let no, one then, run down law, as if, on account of the penalty, it were not beautiful and good. For shall he who drives away bodily disease appear a benefactor; and shall not he who attempts to deliver the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from iniquity, as much more appear a friend, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a more precious thing than the body? Besides, for the sake of bodily health we submit to incisions, and cauterizations, and medicinal draughts; and he who administers them is called saviour and healer,  even though amputating parts, not from grudge or ill-will towards the patient, but as the principles of the art prescribe, so that the sound parts may not perish along with them, and no one accuses the physician's art of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and shall we not similarly submit, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> sake, to either banishment, or punishment, or bonds, provided only from unrighteousness we shall attain to righteousness?</p>

<p>For the law, in its solicitude for those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, trains up to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and prescribes what is to be done, and restrains each one from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, imposing penalties even on lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>But when it sees any one in such a condition as to appear incurable, posting to the last stage of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, then in its solicitude for the rest, that they may not be destroyed by it (just as if amputating a part from the whole body), it condemns such an one to death, as the course most conducive to health. <q>Being judged by the Lord,</q> says the apostle, <q>we are chastened, that we may not be condemned with the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022115"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:32</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had said before, <q>Chastening, the Lord has chastised me, but has not given me over unto death.</q>  <q>For in order to teach you His righteousness,</q> it is said, <q>He chastised you and tried you, and made you to hunger and thirst in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> land; that all His statutes and His judgments may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in your heart, as I command you this day; and that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in your heart, that just as if a man were chastising his son, so the Lord our God shall chastise you.</q> </p>

<p>And to prove that example corrects, he says directly to the purpose: <q>A clever man, when he sees the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> punished, will himself be severely chastised, for the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the source of wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022118"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;22:3-4</a></span> </p>

<p>But it is the highest and most perfect good, when one is able to lead back any one from the practice of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and well-doing, which is the very function of the law. So that, when one fails into any incurable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;when taken possession of, for example, by wrong or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>&mdash;it will be for his good if he is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. For the law is beneficent, being able to make some righteous from unrighteous, if they will only give ear to it, and by releasing others from present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; for those who have chosen to live temperately and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, it conducts to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the law is characteristic of a good disposition. And again: <q>Wicked men do not understand the law; but they who seek the Lord shall have understanding in all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022119"><a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;28:5</a></span> </p>

<p>It is essential, certainly, that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which manages all, be both supreme and good. For it is the power of both that dispenses <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; the one correcting by punishment, as supreme, the other showing kindness in the exercise of beneficence, as a benefactor. It is in your power not to be a son of disobedience, but to pass from darkness to life, and lending your ear to wisdom, to be the legal slave of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the first instance, and then to become a faithful servant, fearing the Lord God. And if one ascend higher, he is enrolled among the sons.</p>

<p>But when <q>charity covers the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022120"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> by the consummation of the blessed hope, then may we welcome him as one who has been enriched in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and received into the elect adoption, which is called the beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he chants the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, saying, <q>Let the Lord be my God.</q></p>

<p>The beneficent action of the law, the apostle showed in the passage relating to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, writing thus: <q>Behold, you are called a Jew and rest in the law, and make your boast in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law, and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022121"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;2:17-20</a></span> For it is admitted that such is the power of the law, although those whose conduct is not according to the law, make a false pretence, as if they lived in the law. <q>Blessed is the man that has found wisdom, and the mortal who has seen understanding; for out of its mouth,</q> manifestly Wisdom's, <q>proceeds righteousness, and it bears law and mercy on its tongue.</q>  For both the law and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are the energy of one Lord, who is <q>the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and the terror which the law begets is merciful and in order to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <q>Let not <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> fail you, but hang them around your neck.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022123"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;3:3</a></span> In the same way as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> upbraids the people with not understanding the law. <q>Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022124"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;59:7-8</a>; <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;3:16-17</a></span> <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God before their eyes.</q>  <q>Professing themselves wise, they became fools.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022126"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;1:22</a></span> <q>And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if a man use it lawfully.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022127"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> <q>Desiring to be teachers of the law, they understand,</q> says the apostle, <q>neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022128"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:7</a></span> <q>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022129"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. The Fourfold Division of the Mosaic Law</h2>

<p>The Mosaic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is accordingly divided into four parts&mdash;into the historic, and that which is specially called the legislative, which two properly belong to an ethical treatise; and the third, that which relates to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, which belongs to physical science; and the fourth, above all, the department of theology, <q>vision,</q>  which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> predicates of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And this species Aristotle calls metaphysics. Dialectics, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, is, as he says in <em>The Statesman</em>, a science devoted to the discovery of the explanation of things. And it is to be acquired by the wise man, not for the sake of saying or doing anything of what we find among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (as the dialecticians, who occupy themselves in sophistry, do), but to be able to say and do, as far as possible, what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> dialectic, being <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> mixed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by examining things, and testing forces and powers, gradually ascends in relation to the most excellent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of all, and essays to go beyond to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, professing not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of mortal affairs, but the science of things divine and heavenly; in accordance with which follows a suitable course of practice with respect to words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. Rightly, therefore, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, in its desire to make us such dialecticians, exhorts us: <q>Be skilful money-changers</q>  rejecting some things, but retaining what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> dialectic is the science which analyses the objects of thought, and shows abstractly and by itself the individual substratum of existences, or the power of dividing things into genera, which descends to their most special properties, and presents each individual object to be contemplated simply such as it is.</p>

<p>Wherefore it alone conducts to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, which is the divine power which deals with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of entities as entities, which grasps what is perfect, and is freed from all passion; not without the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who withdraws, by the divine word, the gloom of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> arising from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> training, which had overspread the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and bestows the best of gifts,&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>That we might well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or God or man.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>It is He who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> shows how we are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ourselves. It is He who reveals the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to whom He wills, and as far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can comprehend. <q>For no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022133"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> Rightly, then, the apostle says that it was by revelation that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: <q>As I wrote afore in few words, according as you are able to understand my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022134"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> <q>According as you are able,</q> he said, since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that some had received milk only, and had not yet received meat, nor even milk simply. The sense of the law is to be taken in three ways, &mdash; either as exhibiting a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, or laying down a precept for right conduct, or as uttering a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. But I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it belongs to men [of full age] to distinguish and declare these things. For the whole Scripture is not in its meaning a single Myconos, as the proverbial expression has it; but those who hunt after the connection of the divine teaching, must approach it with the utmost perfection of the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> faculty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. The Greeks But Children Compared with the Hebrews</h2>

<p>Whence most beautifully the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said, <q>O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children, not having in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> a single ancient opinion received through tradition from antiquity. And not one of the Greeks is an old man;</q>  meaning by old, I suppose, those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what belongs to the more remote antiquity, that is, our literature; and by young, those who treat of what is more recent and made the subject of study by the Greeks,&mdash; things of yesterday and of recent date as if they were old and ancient. Wherefore he added, <q>and no study hoary with time;</q> for we, in a kind of barbarous way, deal in homely and rugged metaphor. Those, therefore, whose minds are rightly constituted approach the interpretation utterly destitute of artifice. And of the Greeks, he says that their opinions differ but little from myths. For neither puerile fables nor stories current among children are fit for listening to. And he called the myths themselves <q>children,</q> as if the progeny of those, wise in their own conceits among the Greeks, who had but little insight; meaning by the <q>hoary studies</q> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was possessed by the barbarians, dating from the highest antiquity. To which expression he opposed the phrase <q>child fable,</q> censuring the mythical character of the attempts of the moderns, as, like children, having nothing of age in them, and affirming both in common&mdash; their fables and their speeches&mdash; to be puerile.</p>

<p>Divinely, therefore, the power which spoke to Hermas by revelation said, <q>The visions and revelations are for those who are of double <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in their hearts if these things are or are not.</q> </p>

<p>Similarly, also, demonstrations from the resources of erudition, strengthen, confirm, and establish demonstrative reasonings, in so far as men's minds are in a wavering state like young people's. <q>The good commandment,</q> then, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>is a lamp, and the law is a light to the path; for instruction corrects the ways of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022138"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;6:23</a></span> <q>Law is monarch of all, both of mortals and of immortals,</q> says Pindar. I understand, however, by these words, Him who enacted law. And I regard, as spoken of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, the following utterance of Hesiod, though spoken by the poet at random and not with comprehension:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For the Saturnian framed for men this law: <br>Fishes, and beasts, and winged birds may eat <br>Each other, since no rule of right is theirs; <br>But Right (by far the best) to men he gave.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Whether, then, it be the law which is connate and natural, or that given afterwards, which is meant, it is certainly of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and both the law of nature and that of instruction are one. Thus also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in <em>The Statesman</em>, says that the lawgiver is one; and in <em>The Laws</em>, that he who shall understand music is one; teaching by these words that the Word is one, and God is one. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> manifestly calls the Lord a covenant: <q>Behold I am my Covenant with you,</q>  having previously told him not to seek the covenant in writing.  For it is a covenant which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Author of all, makes. For God is called <span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> (placing), and order or arrangement. And in the <em>Preaching</em>  of Peter you will find the Lord called Law and Word. But at this point, let our first Miscellany  of gnostic notes, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, come to a close.</p>
