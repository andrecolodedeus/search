<h1>The Stromata (Book IV)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Order of Contents</h2>

<p>It will follow, I think, that I should treat of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and of who the perfect man is. With these points shall be included what follows in accordance with the demands of the points to be spoken about, and how both bond and free must equally philosophize, whether male or female in sex. And in the sequel, after finishing what is to be said on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and inquiry, we shall set forth the department of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>; so that, on cursorily concluding the discourse on ethics, we shall exhibit the advantage which has accrued to the Greeks from the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. After which sketch, the brief explanation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> both against the Greeks and against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> will be presented, and whatever points we were unable to embrace in the previous <em>Miscellanies</em> (through having respect necessarily to the multitude of matters), in accordance with the commencement of the poem, purposing to finish them in one commentary. In addition to these points, afterwards on completing the sketch, as far as we can in accordance with what we propose, we must give an account of the physical doctrines of the Greeks and of the barbarians, respecting elementary principles, as far as their opinions have reached us, and argue against the principal views excogitated by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.</p>

<p>It will naturally fall after these, after a cursory view of theology, to discuss the opinions handed down respecting <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; so that, having demonstrated that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are valid from their <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> authority, we shall be able to go over them consecutively, and to show thence to all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> one God and Omnipotent Lord to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> preached by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and besides by the blessed <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Many contradictions against the heterodox await us while we attempt, in writing, to do away with the force of the allegations made by them, and to persuade them against their will, proving by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves.</p>

<p>On completing, then, the whole of what we propose in the commentaries, on which, if the Spirit will, we ministering to the urgent need, (for it is exceedingly necessary, before coming to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to embrace what ought to be said by way of preface), shall address ourselves to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gnostic science of nature, receiving initiation into the minor <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> before the greater; so that nothing may be in the way of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine declaration of sacred things, the subjects requiring preliminary detail and statement being cleared away, and sketched beforehand. The science of nature, then, or rather observation, as contained in the gnostic tradition according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, depends on the discussion concerning cosmogony, ascending thence to the department of theology. Whence, then, we shall begin our account of what is handed down, with the creation as related by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, introducing also the tenets of the heterodox, and endeavouring as far as we can to confute them. But it shall be written if God will, and as He inspires; and now we must proceed to what we proposed, and complete the discourse on ethics.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Meaning of the Name Stromata or Miscellanies</h2>

<p>Let these notes of ours, as we have often said for the sake of those that consult them carelessly and unskilfully, be of varied character&mdash; and as the name itself indicates, patched together&mdash; passing constantly from one thing to another, and in the series of discussions hinting at one thing and demonstrating another. <q>For those who seek for gold,</q> says Heraclitus, <q>dig much earth and find little gold.</q> But those who are of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> golden race, in mining for what is allied to them, will find the much in little. For the word will find one to understand it. The Miscellanies of notes contribute, then, to the recollection and expression of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the case of him who is able to investigate with reason. And you must prosecute, in addition to these, other labours and researches; since, in the case of people who are setting out on a road with which they are unacquainted, it is sufficient merely to point out the direction. After this they must walk and find out the rest for themselves. As, they say, when a certain slave once asked at the oracle what he should do to please his master, the Pythian priestess replied, <q>You will find if you seek.</q> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a difficult matter, then, as turns out, to find out latent good; since</p> <blockquote><p><q>Before <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is placed exertion, <br>And long and steep is the way to it, <br>And rough at first; but when the summit is reached, <br>Then is it easy, though difficult [before].</q></p></blockquote>

<p><q>For narrow,</q> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>and strait is the way</q> of the Lord. And it is to the <q>violent that the kingdom of God belongs.</q> </p>

<p>Whence, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> holding on by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> royal road, and not deviating. As we might expect, then, the generative power of the seeds of the doctrines comprehended in this treatise is great in small space, as the <q>universal herbage of the field,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022681"><a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse25">Job&nbsp;5:25</a></span> as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says. Thus the Miscellanies of notes have their proper title, wonderfully like that ancient oblation culled from all sorts of things of which Sophocles writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For there was a sheep's fleece, and there was a vine, <br>And a libation, and grapes well stored; <br>And there was mixed with it fruit of all kinds, <br>And the fat of the olive, and the most curious <br>Wax-formed work of the yellow bee.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Just so our <em>Stromata</em>, according to the husbandman of the comic poet Timocles, produce <q>figs, olives, dried figs, honey, as from an all-fruitful field;</q> on account of which exuberance he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q> You speak of a harvest-wreath not of husbandry.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> were wont to cry:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The harvest-wreath bears figs and fat loaves, <br>And honey in a cup, and olive oil to anoint you.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>We must then often, as in winnowing sieves, shake and toss up this the great mixture of seeds, in order to separate the wheat.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The True Excellence of Man</h2>

<p>The most of men have a disposition unstable and heedless, like the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of storms. <q>Want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has done many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</q> And Epicharmus says, <q>Don't forget to exercise incredulity; for it is the sinews of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> Now, to disbelieve <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> brings death, as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, life; and again, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the lie and to disbelieve the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hurries to destruction. The same is the case with self-restraint and licentiousness. To restrain one's self from doing good is the work of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; but to keep from wrong is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. So the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, by abstinence from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, seems to indicate self-restraint. And what, I ask, is it in which man differs from beasts, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on the other hand, are wiser than he? <q>You made him a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q>  For some do not interpret this Scripture of the Lord, although He also bore flesh, but of the perfect man and the gnostic, inferior in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in time, and by reason of the vesture [of the body]. I call then wisdom nothing but science, since life differs not from life. For to live is common to the mortal nature, that is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with that to which has been vouchsafed <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; as also the faculty of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and of self-restraint, one of the two being more excellent. On this ground Pythagoras seems to me to have said that God alone is wise, since also the apostle writes in the Epistle to the Romans, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among all nations, being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the only wise God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022683"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;16:26-27</a></span> and that he himself was a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, on account of his friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> talked with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as a friend with a friend.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022684"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;33:11</a></span> That, then, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> being clear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, immediately generates <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the gnostic loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Go,</q> it is said, <q>to the ant, you sluggard, and be the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the bee;</q> thus speaks Solomon. <span class="stiki" id="note022685"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;6:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> For if there is one function belonging to the peculiar nature of each creature, alike of the ox, and horse, and dog, what shall we say is the peculiar function of man? He is like, it appears to me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of a rational and irrational part, of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Well, the body tills the ground, and hastes to it; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is raised to God: trained in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the body, and besides these, from toil and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, although we have shown that patience and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man. For if <q>by the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022686"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> as those allege who disparage the law, and <q>till the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was in the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022687"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;5:13</a></span> yet <q>without the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022688"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;7:6</a></span> we oppose them. For when you take away the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you have taken away <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and much more, punishment, when you have taken away that which gives rise to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. <q>For the law is not made for the just man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022689"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. Well, then, says Heraclitus, <q>They would not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the name of Justice if these things had not been.</q> And Socrates says, <q>that the law was not made for the sake of the good.</q> But the cavillers did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even this, as the apostle says, <q>that he who loves his brother works not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> for this, <q>You shall not kill, you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in the word, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022690"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;13:8-10</a></span> So also is it said, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022691"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;10:27</a></span> And <q>if he that loves his neighbour works no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> and if <q>every commandment is comprehended in this, the loving our neighbour,</q> the commandments, by menacing with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, work <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Wherefore the law is productive of the emotion of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>So that the law is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <q>spiritual,</q>  according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in investigating the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, apprehend the end of each, and not regard death as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>For when you were the servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>you were free from righteousness. What fruit did you have in those things in which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death: but the gift of God is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022693"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;6:20-23</a></span> The assertion, then, may be hazarded, that it has been shown that death is the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the body; and life the separation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And many are the stakes and ditches of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which impede us, and the pits of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which must be overleaped, and all the machinations we must avoid of those who plot against us&mdash;who would no longer see the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God <q>through a glass.</q></p> <blockquote><p><q>The half of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the far-seeing Zeus takes <br>From man, when he reduces him to a state of slavery.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>As slaves the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> views those <q>under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> and <q>sold to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> the lovers of pleasure and of the body; and beasts rather than men, <q>those who have become like to cattle, horses, neighing after their neighbours' wives.</q>  The licentious is <q>the lustful ass,</q> the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> is the <q>savage wolf,</q> and the deceiver is <q>a serpent.</q> The severance, therefore, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, made a life-long study, produces in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> gnostic alacrity, so that he is easily able to bear natural death, which is the dissolution of the chains which bind the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body. <q>For the world is crucified to me, and I to the world,</q> the [apostle] says; <q>and now I live, though in the flesh, as having my conversation in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022695"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a>; <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Praises of Martyrdom</h2>

<p>Whence, as is reasonable, the gnostic, when Galled, obeys easily, and gives up his body to him who asks; and, previously divesting himself of the affections of this carcass, not insulting the tempter, but rather, in my opinion, training him and convincing him&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>From what <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and what extent of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> fallen,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>as says Empedocles, here for the future he walks with mortals. He, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to himself that he is faithful and loyal towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and to the tempter, that he in vain envied him who is faithful through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and to the Lord, of the inspired persuasion in reference to His doctrine, from which he will not depart through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death; further, he confirms also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of preaching by his deed, showing that God to whom he hastes is powerful. You will wonder at his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which he conspicuously shows with thankfulness, in being united to what is allied to him, and besides by his precious blood, shaming the unbelievers. He then avoids denying Christ through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by reason of the command; nor does he sell his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the hope of the gifts prepared, but in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Lord he will most gladly depart from this life; perhaps giving thanks both to him who afforded the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his departure hence, and to him who laid the plot against him, for receiving an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> reason which he himself furnished not, for showing what he is, to him by his patience, and to the Lord in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which even before his birth he was manifested to the Lord, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> choice. With good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, then, he goes to the Lord, his friend, for whom he voluntarily gave his body, and, as his judges hoped, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, hearing from our Saviour the words of poetry, <q>Dear brother,</q> by reason of the similarity of his life. We call <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> perfection, not because the man comes to the end of his life as others, but because he has exhibited the perfect work of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And the ancients laud the death of those among the Greeks who died in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, not that they advised people to die a violent death, but because he who ends his life in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is released without the dread of dying, severed from the body without experiencing previous suffering or being enfeebled in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the people that suffer in diseases. For they depart in a state of effeminacy and desiring to live; and therefore they do not yield up the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pure, but bearing with it their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> like weights of lead; all but those who have been conspicuous in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Some die in battle with their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, these being in no respect different from what they would have been if they had wasted away by disease.</p>

<p>If the confession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has lived purely in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the commandments, is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> both by life and word, in whatever way it may be released from the body&mdash;shedding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as blood along its whole life till its departure. For instance, the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Whosoever shall leave father, or mother, or brethren,</q> and so forth, <q>for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and my name,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022696"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;19:29</a></span> he is blessed; not indicating simple <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but the gnostic <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as of the man who has conducted himself according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Lord (for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Name and the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> point out the gnosis, but not the bare appellation), so as to leave his worldly kindred, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and every possession, in order to lead a life free from passion. <q>Mother</q> figuratively means country and sustenance; <q>fathers</q> are the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of civil polity: which must be contemned thankfully by the high-souled just man; for the sake of being the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of obtaining the right hand in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, as the Apostles have done.</p>

<p>Then Heraclitus says, <q>Gods and men <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those slain in battle;</q> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the fifth book of the <em>Republic</em> writes, <q>Of those who die in military service, whoever dies after winning renown, shall we not say that he is chief of the golden race? Most assuredly.</q> But the golden race is with the gods, who are in heaven, in the fixed sphere, who chiefly hold command in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> exercised towards men. Now some of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have misunderstood the Lord, have at once an impious and cowardly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life; saying that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God (which we also admit), and that the man is a self-murderer and a suicide who makes confession by death; and adducing other similar sophisms of cowardice. To these we shall reply at the proper time; for they differ with us in regard to first principles. Now we, too, say that those who have rushed on death (for there are some, not belonging to us, but sharing the name merely, who are in haste to give themselves up, the poor wretches dying through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the Creator )&mdash; these, we say, banish themselves without being <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, even though they are punished publicly. For they do not preserve the characteristic mark of believing <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, inasmuch as they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but give themselves up to a vain death, as the Gymnosophists of the Indians to useless fire.</p>

<p>But since these <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> named  <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the body, let them learn that the harmonious mechanism of the body contributes to the understanding which leads to goodness of nature. Wherefore in the third book of the <em>Republic</em>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, whom they appeal to loudly as an authority that disparages generation, says, <q>that for the sake of harmony of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, care must be taken for the body,</q> by which, he who announces the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, finds it possible to live, and to live well. For it is by the path of life and health that we learn gnosis. But is he who cannot advance to the height without being occupied with necessary things, and through them doing what tends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not to choose to live well? In living, then, living well is secured. And he who in the body has devoted himself to a good life, is being sent on to the state of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. On Contempt for Pain, Poverty, and Other External Things</h2>

<p>Fit objects for admiration are the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not affected by the body, either to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by disease, or to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by health; but both these things, they say, are indifferent. And indeed Job, through exceeding continence, and excellence of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when from rich he became poor, from being held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> dishonoured, from being comely unsightly, and sick from being healthy, is depicted as a good example, putting the Tempter to shame, blessing his Creator; bearing what came second, as the first, and most clearly teaching that it is possible for the gnostic to make an excellent use of all circumstances. And that ancient achievements are proposed as images for our correction, the apostle shows, when he says, <q>So that my bonds in Christ have become manifest in all the palace, and to all the rest; and several of the brethren in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word of God without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022699"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;1:13-14</a></span> &mdash; since <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> testimonies are examples of conversion <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> sanctified. <q>For what things the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks were written for our instruction, that we, through patience and the consolation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, might have the hope of consolation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022700"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;15:4</a></span> When pain is present, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> appears to decline from it, and to deem release from present pain a precious thing. At that moment it slackens from studies, when the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> also are neglected. And yet we do not say that it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself which suffers, for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not affected by disease. But he who is partaker of both, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the disease, is afflicted by the pressure of the latter; and if he who has not yet attained the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of self-command be not a high-souled man, he is distraught; and the inability to endure it is found equivalent to fleeing from it.</p>

<p>The same holds good also in the case of poverty. For it compels the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to desist from necessary things, I mean <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and from pure sinlessness, forcing him, who has not wholly dedicated himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to occupy himself about provisions; as, again, health and abundance of necessaries keep the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free and unimpeded, and capable of making a good use of what is at hand. <q>For,</q> says the apostle, <q>such shall have trouble in the flesh. But I spare you. For I would have you without anxiety, in order to decorum and assiduity for the Lord, without distraction.</q> </p>

<p>These things, then, are to be abstained from, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of the body; and care for the body is exercised for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which it has reference. For on this account it is necessary for the man who lives as a gnostic to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is suitable. Since the fact that pleasure is not a good thing is admitted from the fact that certain pleasures are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by this reason good appears <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good. And then, if we choose some pleasures and shun others, it is not every pleasure that is a good thing.</p>

<p>Similarly, also, the same rule holds with pains, some of which we endure, and others we shun. But choice and avoidance are exercised according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; so that it is not pleasure that is the good thing, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which we shall choose a pleasure at a certain time, and of a certain kind. Now the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> chooses the pleasure that exists in prospect through the present pain. If pain is conceived as existing in thirst, and pleasure in drinking, the pain that has preceded becomes the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pleasure. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good. Neither, then, is the one thing nor the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Simonides accordingly (as also Aristotle) writes, <q>that to be in good health is the best thing, and the second best thing is to be handsome, and the third best thing is to be rich without cheating.</q></p>

<p>And Theognis of Megara says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>You must, to escape poverty, throw <br>Yourself, O Cyrnus down from <br>The steep rocks into the deep sea.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, Antiphanes, the comic poet, says, <q>Plutus (Wealth), when it has taken hold of those who see better than others, makes them blind.</q> Now by the poets he is proclaimed as blind from his birth:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And brought him forth blind who saw not the sun.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Says the Chalcidian Euphorion:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Riches, then, and extravagant luxuries, <br>Were for men the worst training for manliness.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Wrote Euripides in <em>Alexander:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And it is said, <br>Penury has attained wisdom through misfortune; <br>But much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> will capture not <br>Sparta alone, but every city.</q></p></blockquote>

<p><q>It is not then the only coin that mortals have, that which is white silver or golden, but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> too,</q> as Sophocles says.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6. Some Points in the Beatitudes</h2>

<p>Our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Saviour applied poverty and riches, and the like, both to spiritual things and objects of sense. For when He said, <q>Blessed are they that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022702"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> He clearly taught us in every circumstance to seek for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> who, if poor for righteousness' sake, witnesses that the righteousness which he loves is a good thing; and if he <q>hunger and thirst for righteousness' sake,</q> testifies that righteousness is the best thing. Likewise he, that weeps and mourns for righteousness' sake, testifies to the best law that it is beautiful. As, then, <q>those that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>,</q> so also <q>those that hunger and thirst</q> for righteousness' sake, are called <q>blessed</q> by Him who approves of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> desire, which not even famine can put a stop to. And if <q>they hunger after righteousness itself,</q> they are blessed. <q>And blessed are the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>,</q> whether <q>in spirit</q> or in circumstance&mdash; that is, if for righteousness' sake. It is not the poor simply, but those that have wished to become poor for righteousness' sake, that He pronounces blessed&mdash; those who have despised the honours of this world in order to attain <q>the good;</q> likewise also those who, through <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, have become comely in person and character, and those who are of noble birth, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, having through righteousness attained to adoption, and therefore <q>have received power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022703"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> and <q>to tread on serpents and scorpions,</q> and to rule over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <q>the host of the adversary.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022704"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> And, in fine, the Lord's discipline  draws the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> away gladly from the body, even if it wrench itself away in its removal. <q>For he that loves his life shall lose it, and he that loses his life shall find it,</q>  if we only join that which is mortal of us with the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [that we should attain] the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the communication of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. He therefore, who, in accordance with the word of repentance, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his life to be sinful will lose it&mdash; losing it from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from which it is wrenched; but losing it, will find it, according to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which lives again to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but dies to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This, then, is what it is <q>to find one's life,</q> <q>to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one's self.</q></p>

<p>The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say, is affected by a change, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being changed to wisdom. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>: <q>On the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.</q> Now the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also allow the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers&mdash; the menaces of man or the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of <q>Sell what you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and come, follow Me</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022707"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> &mdash; that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what <q>you have</q> He designated the things in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> apportions to you in your magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, being not only justified by abstinence from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.  In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, proclaims itself.  We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> neither from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the two brothers called <q>hirelings.</q> And is there not some light thrown here on the expression <q>in the likeness and image,</q> in the fact that some live according to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? There are then two things proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one root lying beneath both&mdash;the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. But the image is another thing. What means the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, <q>No man can serve two masters, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a>?</q>&mdash; the Lord so terming the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>. For instance, the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. <q>The foxes,</q> then, have holes. He called those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and earthly men who are occupied about the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>: <q>Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022710"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;13:32</a></span> For He applied the name <q>fowls of the air</q> to those who were distinct from the other birds&mdash; those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.  And those cares He indicated in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the fourfold seed, when He said that <q>the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns</q> and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to be trained for the state of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. For it said, <q>I saw the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.</q>  Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>For the different people <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.</q>  <q>They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.</q>  <q>They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.</q> Wherefore <q>let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, says the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.</q>  For it is to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. <q>Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022716"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;6:19</a></span> says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts <q>break through</q> the mind and the whole man. But our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <q>treasure</q> is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, beseeching mercy. He is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>the bag that waxes not old,</q> the provisions of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, <q>the treasure that fails not in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022717"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;12:33</a></span> <q>For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022718"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;9:15</a></span> says the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake.

Therefore Christ, who trains the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, <q>Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold;</q> on which the Saviour said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, on coming today, has found that which was lost.</q>  Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> two mites, He said <q>that the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> had cast in more than they all,</q> for <q>they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.</q> And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He said, <q>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022725"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the battle of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and <q>many mansions,</q> corresponding to men's lives. <q>Whosoever shall receive,</q> says He, <q>a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, shall receive a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, shall not lose his reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022726"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41-42</a></span> And again, the differences of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers&mdash; that is, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is meant by the penny&mdash; He indicated the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.  <q>Those, then,</q> says <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <q>who seem called to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.</q> In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: <q>Those who by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.</q> He adds further: <q>And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.</q> Whence with reason, <q>blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022728"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;5:4</a></span> for they who have repented of their former <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life shall attain to <q>the calling</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), for this is the meaning of being comforted (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03B8;&#x1FC6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>). And there are two styles of penitents.  That which is more common is <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, <q>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</q> And mercy is not, as some of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> say. For it is said, <q>I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q>  And He  means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.  And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, works and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, He called the <q>pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.</q>  And if we really look to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the purification of the leading faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and pure in respect of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the chief faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> quality devotes himself to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to be science and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p><q>Blessed, then, are the peacemakers,</q>  who have subdued and tamed the law which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the menaces of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and the baits of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the reason; who, having lived in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of good works and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason, shall be reinstated in adoption, which is dearer. It follows that the perfect peacemaking is that which keeps unchanged in all circumstances what is peaceful; calls Providence <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good; and has its being in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, by which it deems the opposites that are in the world to be the fairest harmony of creation. They also are peacemakers, who teach those who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the stratagems of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to have recourse to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and peace. And it is the sum of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in my opinion, when the Lord teaches us that for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God we must gnostically despise death. <q>Blessed are they,</q> says He, <q>who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake, for they shall be called the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022735"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> or, as some of those who transpose the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>  say, <q>Blessed are they who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by righteousness, for they shall be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>.</q> And, <q>Blessed are they who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for my sake; for they shall have a place where they shall not be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>.</q> And, <q>Blessed are you when men shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, when they shall separate you, when they shall cast out your name as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man's</a> sake;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022737"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;6:22</a></span> if we do not detest our persecutors, and undergo punishments at their hands, not hating them under the idea that we have been put to trial more tardily than we looked for; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this also, that every instance of trial is an occasion for testifying.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Blessedness of the Martyr</h2>

<p>Then he who has lied and shown himself unfaithful, and revolted to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> army, in what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do we think him to be? He belies, therefore, the Lord, or rather he is cheated of his own hope who believes not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he believes not who does not what He has commanded.</p> 

<p>And what? Does not he, who denies the Lord, deny himself? For does he not rob his Master of His authority, who deprives himself of his relation to Him? He, then, who denies the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, denies life; for <q>the light was life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022738"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;1:4</a></span> He does not term those men of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but faithless and hypocrites, <span class="stiki" id="note022739"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;6:30</a></span> who have the name inscribed on them, but deny that they are really <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. But the faithful is called both servant and friend. So that if one loves himself, he loves the Lord, and confesses to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that he may save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Though you die for your neighbour out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and regard the Saviour as our neighbour (for God who saves is said to be near in respect to what is saved); you do so, choosing death on account of life, and suffering for your own sake rather than his. And is it not for this that he is called brother? He who, suffering out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, suffered for his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; while he, on the other hand, who dies for his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, endures for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For he being life, in what he suffered wished to suffer that we might live by his suffering.</p>

<p><q>Why do you call me Lord, Lord,</q> He says, <q>and do not the things which I say?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022740"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;6:46</a></span> For <q>the people that loves with their lips, but have their heart far away from the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022741"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;29:15</a></span> is another people, and trust in another, and have willingly sold themselves to another; but those who perform the commandments of the Lord, in every action <q>testify,</q> by doing what He wishes, and consistently naming the Lord's name; and <q>testifying</q> by deed to Him in whom they trust, that they are those <q>who have crucified the flesh, with the affections and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <q>If we live in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us also walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022742"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;5:24-25</a></span> <q>He that sows to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022743"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;6:8</a></span> </p>

<p>But to those miserable men, <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Lord by blood seems a most violent death, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that such a gate of death is the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life; and they will understand neither the honours after death, which belong to those who have lived holily, nor the punishments of those who have lived unrighteously and impurely.  I do not say only from our Scriptures (for almost all the commandments indicate them); but they will not even hear their own discourses. For the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> Theano writes, <q>Life were indeed a feast to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who, having done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, then die; were not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, death would be a godsend.</q> And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the <em>Ph&aelig;do</em>, <q>For if death were release from everything,</q> and so forth. We are not then to think according to the <em>Telephus</em> of &AElig;schylus, <q>that a single path leads to Hades.</q> The ways are many, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that lead there. Such deeply erring ones as the unfaithful are, Aristophanes properly makes the subjects of comedy. <q>Come,</q> he says, <q>you men of obscure life, you that are like the race of leaves, feeble, wax figures, shadowy tribes, evanescent, fleeting, ephemeral.</q> And Epicharmus, <q>This nature of men is inflated skins.</q> And the Saviour has said to us, <q>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022745"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> <q>Because the carnal mind is enmity against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> explains the apostle: <q>for it is not subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither indeed, can be. And they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</q> And in further explanation continues, that no one may, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>  regard the creature as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>But if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</q> And again: <q>For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us. If we suffer with Him, that we also may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together as joint-heirs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to them that are called according to the purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren. And whom He did <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a>, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> </p>

<p>You see that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love's</a> sake is taught. And should you wish to be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the recompense of advantages, you shall hear again. <q>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022748"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> <q>But if we also suffer for righteousness' sake,</q> says Peter, <q>blessed are we. Be not afraid of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, neither be troubled. But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to him that asks a reason of the hope that is in you, but with meekness and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, having a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; so that in reference to that for which you are spoken against, they may be ashamed who <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> your good conversation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>The Indian sages say to Alexander of Macedon: <q>You transport men's bodies from place to place. But you shall not force our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to do what we do not wish. Fire is to men the greatest torture, this we despise.</q> Hence Heraclitus preferred one thing, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to all else; and professes <q>that he allows the crowd to stuff themselves to satiety like cattle.</q></p> <blockquote><p><q>For on account of the body are many toils, <br>For it we have invented a roofed house, <br>And discovered how to dig up silver, and sow the land, <br>And all the rest which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by names.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>To the multitude, then, this vain labour is desirable. But to us the apostle says, <q>Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022757"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> Does not the apostle then plainly add the following, to show the contempt for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the case of the multitude? <q>For I think that God has set forth us the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> last, as appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to men. Up to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are beaten, and are feeble, and labour, working with our hands. Being reviled, we bless; being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, we endure; being defamed, we entreat; we have become as it were the offscourings of the world.</q>  Such also are the words of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the <em>Republic:</em>  <q>The just man, though stretched on the rack, though his eyes are dug out, will be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will never then have the chief end placed in life, but in being always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and blessed, and a kingly friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Although visited with ignominy and exile, and confiscation, and above all, death, he will never be wrenched from his freedom, and signal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>The charity which bears all things, endures all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022760"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> is assured that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> orders all things well. <q>I exhort you,</q> therefore it is said, <q>Be followers of me.</q> The first step to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>  is the instruction accompanied with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in consequence of which we abstain from what is wrong; and the second is hope, by reason of which we desire the best things; but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as is fitting, perfects, by training now according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the Greeks, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, attributing events to unreasoning necessity, own that they yield to them unwillingly. Accordingly Euripides says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>What I declare, receive from me, madam: <br>No mortal exists who has not toil; <br>He buries children, and begets others, <br>And he himself dies. And thus mortals are afflicted.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>We must bear those things which are inevitable according to nature, and go through them: <br>Not one of the things which are necessary is formidable for mortals.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And for those who are aiming at perfection there is proposed the rational gnosis, the foundation of which is <q>the sacred Triad.</q> <q>Faith, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but the greatest of these is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q>  Truly, <q>all things are lawful, but all things are not expedient,</q> says the apostle: <q>all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022763"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:23</a></span> And, <q>Let no one seek his own advantage, but also that of his neighbour,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022764"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:24</a></span> so as to be able at once to do and to teach, building and building up. For that <q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof,</q> is admitted; but the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the weak is supported. <q>Conscience, I say, not his own, but that of the other; for why is my liberty judged of by another <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? For if I by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> am partaker, why am I <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

<h2>Chapter 8. Women as Well as Men, Slaves as Well as Freemen, Candidates for the Martyr's Crown</h2>

<p>Since, then, not only the &AElig;sopians, and Macedonians, and the Laced&aelig;monians endured when subjected to torture, as Eratosthenes says in his work, <em>On Things Good and Evil;</em> but also Zeno of Elea, when subjected to compulsion to divulge a secret, held out against the tortures, and confessed nothing; who, when expiring, bit out his tongue and spat it at the tyrant, whom some term Nearchus, and some Demulus. Theodotus the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> acted also similarly, and Paulus the friend of Lacydes, as Timotheus of Pergamus says in his work on <em>The Fortitude of Philosophers</em>, and Achaicus in <em>The Ethics</em>. Posthumus also, the Roman, when captured by Peucetion, did not divulge a single secret; but putting his hand on the fire, held it to it as if to a piece of brass, without moving a muscle of his face. I omit the case of Anaxarchus, who exclaimed, <q>Pound away at the sack which holds Anaxarchus, for it is not Anaxarchus you are pounding,</q> when by the tyrant's orders he was being pounded with iron pestles. Neither, then, the hope of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God takes what befalls ill, but remains free, although thrown among the wildest beasts or into the all-devouring fire; though racked with a tyrant's tortures. Depending as it does on the divine favour, it ascends aloft unenslaved, surrendering the body to those who can touch it alone. A barbarous nation, not cumbered with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, select, it is said, annually an ambassador to the hero Zamolxis. Zamolxis was one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Pythagoras. The one, then, who is judged of the most sterling worth is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, to the distress of those who have practiced <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but have not been selected, at being reckoned unworthy of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> service.</p>

<p>So the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is full of those, as well chaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as men, who all their life have contemplated the death which rouses up to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  For the individual whose life is framed as ours is, may philosophize without Learning, whether barbarian, whether Greek, whether slave&mdash; whether an old man, or a boy, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.  For self-control is common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings who have made choice of it. And we admit that the same nature exists in every race, and the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. As far as respects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> does not possess one nature, and the man exhibit another, but the same: so also with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If, consequently, a self-restraint and righteousness, and whatever qualities are regarded as following them, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the male, it belongs to the male alone to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be licentious and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. But it is offensive even to say this. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is to practice self-restraint and righteousness, and every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as well as man, both bond and free; since it is a fit consequence that the same nature possesses one and the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  We do not say that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> nature is the same as man's, as she is <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For undoubtedly it stands to reason that some difference should exist between each of them, in virtue of which one is male and the other female. Pregnancy and parturition, accordingly, we say belong to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as she is <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and not as she is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. But if there were no difference between man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, both would do and suffer the same things. As then there is sameness, as far as respects the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, she will attain to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but as there is difference as respects the peculiar construction of the body, she is destined for child-bearing and housekeeping. <q>For I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the man: for the man is not of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the man. For neither is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without the man, nor the man without the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in the Lord.</q>  For as we say that the man ought to be continent, and superior to pleasures; so also we reckon that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be continent and practiced in fighting against pleasures. <q>But I say, Walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and you shall not fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh,</q> counsels the apostolic command; <q>for the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. These, then, are contrary</q> (not as good to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as fighting advantageously), he adds therefore, so that you cannot do the things that you would. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornication uncleanness, profligacy, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, witchcrafts, enmities, strifes, jealousies, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, contentions, dissensions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like; of which I tell you before, as I have also said before, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But the fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meekness.  He calls sinners, as I think, <q>flesh,</q> and the righteous <q>spirit.</q> Further, manliness is to be assumed in order to produce confidence and forbearance, so as <q>to him that strikes on the one cheek, to give to him the other; and to him that takes away the cloak, to yield to him the coat also,</q> strongly, restraining <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For we do not train our <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> like Amazons to manliness in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; since we wish the men even to be peaceable. I hear that the Sarmatian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> practice <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> no less than the men; and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the Sac&aelig; besides, who shoot backwards, feigning flight as well as the men. I am aware, too, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> near Iberia practice manly work and toil, not refraining from their tasks even though near their delivery; but even in the very struggle of her pains, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, on being delivered, taking up the infant, carries it home. Further, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> no less than the males manage the house, and hunt, and keep the flocks:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Cressa the hound ran keenly in the stag's track.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Women are therefore to philosophize equally with men, though the males are preferable at everything, unless they have become effeminate.  To the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, then, discipline and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are a necessity, if they would pursue after <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And how recklessly Euripides writes sometimes this and sometimes that! On one occasion, <q>For every wife is inferior to her husband, though the most excellent one marry her that is of fair fame.</q> And on another:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For the chaste is her husband's slave, <br>While she that is unchaste in her folly despises her consort. <br> . . . . For nothing is better and more excellent, <br>Than when as husband and wife you keep house, <br>Harmonious in your sentiments.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The ruling power is therefore the head. And if <q>the Lord is head of the man, and the man is head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> the man, <q>being the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is lord of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q>  Wherefore also in the Epistle to the Ephesians it is written, <q>Subjecting yourselves one to another in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and He is the Saviour of the body. Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, as also Christ loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. So also ought men to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives as their own bodies: he that loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever yet <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022775"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;5:21-29</a></span> And in that to the Colossians it is said, <q>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord.  Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in all things; for this is well pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Fathers, provoke not your children to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, lest they be discouraged. Servants, be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> in all things to those who are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but with singleness of heart, fearing the Lord. And whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as serving the Lord and not men; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer shall receive the wrong, which he has done; and there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Masters, render to your servants <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and equity; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you also have a Master in heaven, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: but Christ is all, and in all.</q>  And the earthly Church is the image of the heavenly, as we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also <q>that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be done upon the earth as in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022778"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;6:10</a></span> <q>Putting on, therefore, bowels of mercy, gentleness, humbleness, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if one have a quarrel against any man; as also Christ has forgiven us, so also let us. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you are called in one body; and be thankful.</q>  For there is no obstacle to adducing frequently the same Scripture in order to put <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>  to the blush, if perchance he be persuaded and converted; by learning that the faithful ought to be grateful to God the Creator, who has called us, and who preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the body. From these considerations the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is clear, and it is shown who is the perfect man; so that though some are reluctant, and offer as much resistance as they can, though menaced with punishments at the hand of husband or master, both the domestic and the wife will philosophize. Moreover, the free, though threatened with death at a tyrant's hands, and brought before the tribunals, and all his substances imperilled, will by no means abandon <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; nor will the wife who dwells with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> husband, or the son if he has a bad father, or the domestic if he has a bad master, ever fail in holding nobly to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But as it is noble for a man to die for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and for liberty, and for himself, so also is it for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For this is not peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of males, but to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the good. Accordingly, both the old man, the young, and the servant will live faithfully, and if need be die; which will be to be made alive by death. So we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that both children, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and servants have often, against their fathers', and masters', and husbands' will, reached the highest degree of excellence. Wherefore those who are determined to live piously ought none the less to exhibit alacrity, when some seem to exercise compulsion on them; but much more, I think, does it become them to show eagerness, and to strive with uncommon vigour, lest, being overcome, they abandon the best and most indispensable counsels. For it does not, I think, admit of comparison, whether it be better to be a follower of the Almighty than to choose the darkness of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For the things which are done by us on account of others we are to do always, endeavouring to have respect to those for whose sake it is proper that they be done, regarding the gratification rendered in their case, as what is to be our rule; but the things which are done for our own sake rather than that of others, are to be done with equal earnestness, whether they are like to please certain people or not. If some indifferent things have obtained such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as to appear worthy of adoption, though against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of some; much more is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be regarded by us as worth contending for, looking the while to nothing but what can be rightly done, whether it seem good to others or not. Well then, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, writing to Men&oelig;ceus, says, <q>Let not him who is young delay <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>, and let not the old man grow weary of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>; for no one is either not of age or past age for attending to the health of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And he who says that the time for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> is not come or is past, is like the man who says that the time for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not come or has gone. So that young  as well as old ought to philosophize: the one, in order that, while growing old, he may grow young in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things out of favour accruing from what is past; and the other, that he may be at once young and old, from want of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for the future.</q></p>

<p>On <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the Lord has spoken explicitly, and what is written in different places we bring together. <q>But I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess in Me before men, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also shall confess before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I deny before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022782"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;12:8</a></span> Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me or of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also be ashamed when He comes in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father with His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Whosoever therefore shall confess in Me before men, him will I also confess before my Father in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note022783"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> <q>And when they bring you before <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and rulers, and powers, think not beforehand how you shall make your defence, or what you shall say. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall teach you in the same hour what you must say.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022784"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;12:11-12</a></span> In explanation of this passage, Heracleon, the most distinguished of the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, says expressly, <q>that there is a confession by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and conduct, and one with the voice. The confession that is made with the voice, and before the authorities, is what the most reckon the only confession. Not soundly: and hypocrites also can confess with this confession. But neither will this utterance be found to be spoken universally; for all the saved have confessed with the confession made by the voice, and departed.  Of whom are Matthew, Philip, <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, Levi, and many others. And confession by the lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is universal, that which is by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and actions corresponding to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition.  And he has well used, with regard to those who confess, the expression 'in Me,' and applied to those who deny the expression'Me.' For those, though they confess Him with the voice, yet deny Him, not confessing Him in their conduct. But those alone confess 'in Him,' who live in the confession and conduct according to Him, in which He also confesses, who is contained in them and held by them. Wherefore 'He never can deny Himself.' And those deny Him who are not in Him. For He said not, 'Whosoever shall deny' in Me, but 'Me.' For no one who is in Him will ever deny Him. And the expression 'before men?' applies both to the saved and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> similarly by conduct before the one, and by voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny Him. But those deny Him who are not in Him.</q> So far Heracleon. And in other things he seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this section; but he has not adverted to this, that if some have not by conduct and in their life <q>confessed Christ before men,</q> they are manifested to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with the heart; by confessing Him with the mouth at the tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death. And the disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by death at any time, cuts away all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which were engendered by corporeal desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a sudden repentance in action, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession toward Christ, in the testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in us, how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony with the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to make a defence, that by their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and confession all may be benefited&mdash; those in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being confirmed, and those of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who have devoted themselves to the search after <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> wondering and being led to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and the rest seized with amazement. So that confession is by all means necessary.  For it is in our power. But to make a defence for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not universally necessary. For that does not depend on us. <q>But he that endures to the end shall be saved.</q> For who of those who are wise would not choose to reign in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and even to serve? So some <q>confess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> according to the apostle; <q>but in works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022788"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus&nbsp;1:16</a></span> And these, though they confess nothing but this, will have done at the end one good work. Their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, then, appears to be the cleansing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For instance, the Shepherd  says: <q>You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and blameless.</q> Also the Lord Himself says: <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired to sift you; but I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022790"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31-32</a></span> Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him, <q>drank the cup;</q> in imitation of whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that they might be in reality <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they founded. So, then, also the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> who tread in the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> ought to be sinless, and, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Lord, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also their brother; so that, if occasion call, enduring without stumbling, afflictions for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <q>they may drink the cup.</q> Those who <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in their life by deed, and at the tribunal by word, whether entertaining hope or surmising <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, are better than those who confess <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by their mouth alone. But if one ascend also to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he is a really blessed and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, having confessed perfectly both to the commandments and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the Lord; whom having loved, he acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, resigning pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a deposit. </p> 

<h2>Chapter 10. Those Who Offered Themselves for Martyrdom Reproved</h2>

<p>When, again, He says, <q>When they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in this city, flee to the other,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022792"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> He does not advise flight, as if <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> were an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing; nor does He enjoin them by flight to avoid death, as if in dread of it, but wishes us neither to be the authors nor abettors of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any one, either to ourselves or the persecutor and murderer. For He, in a way, bids us take care of ourselves. But he who disobeys is rash and foolhardy. If he who kills a man of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he also who presents himself before the judgment-seat becomes guilty of his death. And such is also the case with him who does not avoid <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but out of daring presents himself for capture. Such a one, as far as in him lies, becomes an accomplice in the crime of the persecutor. And if he also uses provocation, he is wholly guilty, challenging the wild beast. And similarly, if he afford any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for conflict or punishment, or retribution or enmity, he gives occasion for <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Wherefore, then, we are enjoined not to cling to anything that belongs to this life; but <q>to him that takes our cloak to give our coat,</q> not only that we may continue destitute of inordinate affection, but that we may not by retaliating make our persecutors savage against ourselves, and stir them up to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the name. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Objection, Why Do You Suffer If God Cares for You, Answered</h2>

<p>But, say they, if God cares for you, why are you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>? Has He delivered you to this? No, we do not suppose that the Lord wishes us to be involved in calamities, but that He foretold <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> what would happen&mdash; that we should be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for His name's sake, slaughtered, and impaled. So that it was not that He wished us to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, but He intimated beforehand what we shall suffer by the prediction of what would take place, training us to endurance, to which He promised the inheritance, although we are punished not alone, but along with many. But those, it is said, being malefactors, are righteously punished. Accordingly, they unwillingly bear testimony to our righteousness, we being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> punished for righteousness' sake. But the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the judge does not affect the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the judge must be master of his own opinion&mdash; not pulled by strings, like inanimate machines, set in motion only by external causes. Accordingly he is judged in respect to his judgment, as we also, in accordance with our choice of things desirable, and our endurance. Although we do not wrong, yet the judge looks on us as doing wrong, for he neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nor wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about us, but is influenced by unwarranted prejudice; wherefore also he is judged.  Accordingly they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us, not from the supposition that we are wrong-doers, but imagining that by the very fact of our being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against life in so conducting ourselves, and exhorting others to adopt the like life.</p>

<p>But why are you not helped when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>? Say they. What wrong is done us, as far as we are concerned, in being released by death to go to the Lord, and so undergoing a change of life, as if a change from one time of life to another? Did we think rightly, we should feel <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to those who have afforded the means for speedy departure, if it is for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that we bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; and if not, we should appear to the multitude to be base men. Had they also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, all would have bounded on to the way, and there would have been no choice. But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being the light of the world, reproves unbelief. <q>Should Anytus and Melitus kill me, they will not hurt me in the least; for I do not think it right for the better to be hurt by the worse,</q> [says Socrates]. So that each one of us may with confidence say, <q>The Lord is my helper; I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: what shall man do to me?</q>  <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and no plague shall touch them.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Basilides' Idea of Martyrdom Refuted</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, in the twenty-third book of the <em>Exegetics</em>, respecting those that are punished by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, expresses himself in the following language: <q>For I say this, Whosoever fall under the afflictions mentioned, in consequence of unconsciously transgressing in other matters, are brought to this good end by the kindness of Him who brings them, but accused on other grounds; so that they may not suffer as condemned for what are owned to be iniquities, nor reproached as the adulterer or the murderer, but because they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; which will console them, so that they do not appear to suffer. And if one who has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at all incur suffering&mdash; a rare case&mdash; yet even he will not suffer anything through the machinations of power, but will suffer as the child which seems not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> would suffer.</q> Then further on he adds: <q>As, then, the child which has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before, or committed actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, but has that which committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when subjected to suffering, gets good, reaping the advantage of many difficulties; so also, although a perfect man may not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in act, while he endures afflictions, he suffers similarly with the child. Having within him the sinful principle, but not embracing the opportunity of committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that he is not to be reckoned as not having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For as he who wishes to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is an adulterer, although he does not succeed in committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and he that wishes to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a murderer, although he is unable to kill; so also, if I see the man without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whom I specify, suffering, though he have done nothing bad, I should call him bad, on account of his wishing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For I will affirm anything rather than call Providence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Then, in continuation, he says expressly concerning the Lord, as concerning man: If then, passing from all these observations, you were to proceed to put me to shame by saying, perchance impersonating certain parties, This man has then <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; for this man has suffered&mdash;if you permit, I will say, He has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; but was like a child suffering. If you were to insist more urgently, I would say, That the man you name is man, but that God is righteous: <q>For no one is pure,</q> as one said, 'from pollution.' <span class="stiki" id="note022797"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;14:4</a></span> But the hypothesis of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>  says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before in another life, endures punishment in this&mdash; the elect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, the other purged by appropriate punishment. How can this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, when the confessing and suffering punishment or not depends on ourselves? For in the case of the man who shall deny, Providence, as held by <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, is done away with. I will ask him, then, in the case of a confessor who has been arrested, whether he will confess and be punished in virtue of Providence or not? For in the case of denying he will not be punished. But if, for the sake of escaping and evading the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of punishing such an one, he shall say that the destruction of those who shall deny is of Providence, he will be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> against his will. And how any more is it the case, that there is laid up in heaven the very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> recompense to him who has witnessed, for his witnessing? If Providence did not permit the sinner to get the length of sinning, it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in both cases; both in not rescuing the man who is dragged to punishment for righteousness' sake, and in having rescued him who wished to do wrong, he having done it as far as volition was concerned, but [Providence] having prevented the deed, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> favoured the sinner. And how impious, in deifying the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and in daring to call the Lord a sinful man! For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempting us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what we are, but not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> if we will hold out, but wishing to dislodge us from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, attempts also to bring us into subjection to himself. Which is all that is allowed to him, partly from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of saving us, who have taken occasion from the commandment, from ourselves; partly for the confusion of him who has tempted and failed; for the confirmation of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of those who admire the constancy [displayed]. But if <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> be retribution by way of punishment, then also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and doctrine, on account of which <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> comes, are co-operators in punishment&mdash; than which, what other absurdity could be greater? But with reference to these <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is changed to another body, also of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, at the proper time mention will be made. But at present, to what has been already said, let us add the following: Where any more is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the retribution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed before <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> takes place? And where is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and endures for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And where is the praise of him who has confessed, or the censure of him who has denied? And for what use is right conduct, the mortification of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and the hating of no creature? But if, as <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> himself says, we suppose one part of the declared <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the loving of all things because all things bear a relation to the whole, and another <q>not to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after anything,</q> and a third <q>not to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> anything,</q> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God these also will be punishments, which it were impious to think. For neither did the Lord suffer by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor are those who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since either of two things is the case: either <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a good thing, or those who decree and afflict are guiltless. But nothing is without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. It remains to say that such things happen without the prevention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for this alone saves both the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We must not therefore think that He actively produces afflictions (far be it that we should think this!); but we must be persuaded that He does not prevent those that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them, but overrules for good the crimes of His enemies: <q>I will therefore,</q> He says, <q>destroy the wall, and it shall be for treading under foot.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022799"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Providence being a disciplinary art;  in the case of others for each individual's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in the case of the Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for ours. To this point says the divine apostle: <q>For this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your sanctification, that you abstain from fornication: that each one of you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to possess his vessel in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; not in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of concupiscence, as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the Lord: that none of you should overreach or take advantage of his brother in any matter; because the Lord is the avenger in respect of all such, as we also told you before, and testified. For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Wherefore he that despises, despises not man, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has also given His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022801"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:3-8</a></span> Wherefore the Lord was not prohibited from this sanctification of ours. If, then, one of them were to say, in reply, that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is punished for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed before this embodying, and that he will again reap the fruit of his conduct in this life, for that such are the arrangements of the [divine administration], we shall ask him if the retribution takes place by Providence. For if it be not of the divine administration, the economy of expiations is gone, and their hypothesis falls to the ground; but if expiations are by Providence, punishments are by Providence too. But Providence, although it begins, so to speak, to move with the Ruler, yet is implanted in substances along with their origin by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Such being the case, they must confess either that punishment is not just, and those who condemn and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> do right, or that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> even are wrought by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Labour and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> are not, then, as they say, incident to affairs as rust to iron, but come upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through its own will. And on these points there is much to say, which will be reserved for future consideration, taking them up in due course.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Valentinian's Vagaries About the Abolition of Death Refuted</h2>

<p>Valentinian, in a homily, writes in these words: <q>You are originally <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and children of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and you would have death distributed to you, that you may spend and lavish it, and that death may die in you and by you; for when we dissolve the world, and are not yourselves dissolved, you have dominion over creation and all corruption.</q> For he also, similarly with <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, supposes a class saved by nature, and that this different race has come hither to us from above for the abolition of death, and that the origin of death is the work of the Creator of the world. Wherefore also he so expounds that Scripture, <q>No man shall see the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and live,</q> as if He were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death. Respecting this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he makes those allusions when writing in these expressions: <q>As much as the image is inferior to the living face, so much is the world inferior to the living <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>. What is, then, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the image? The majesty of the face, which exhibits the figure to the painter, to be honoured by his name; for the form is not found exactly to the life, but the name supplies what is wanting in the effigy. The invisibility of God co-operates also in order to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of that which has been fashioned.</q> For the Creator, called God and Father, he designated as <q>Painter,</q> and <q>Wisdom,</q> whose image that which is formed is, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the invisible One; since the things which proceed from a pair are complements, and those which proceed from one are images. But since what is seen is no part of Him, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes from what is intermediate, which is different; and this is the inspiration of the different spirit, and generally what is breathed into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the image of the spirit. And in general, what is said of the Creator, who was made according to the image, they say was foretold by a sensible image in the book of Genesis respecting the origin of man; and the likeness they transfer to themselves, teaching that the addition of the different spirit was made; unknown to the Creator. When, then, we treat of the unity of the God who is proclaimed in the law, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, we shall also discuss this; for the topic is supreme.  But we must advance to that which is urgent. If for the purpose of doing away with death the peculiar race has come, it is not Christ who has abolished death, unless He also is said to be of the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with them. And if He abolished it to this end, that it might not touch the peculiar race, it is not these, the rivals of the Creator, who breathe into the image of their intermediate spirit the life from above&mdash; in accordance with the principle of their dogma&mdash; that abolish death. But should they say that this takes place by His mother,  or should they say that they, along with Christ, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against death, let them own their secret dogma that they have the hardihood to assail the divine power of the Creator, by setting to rights His creation, as if they were superior, endeavouring to save the vital image which He was not able to rescue from corruption. Then the Lord would be superior to God the Creator; for the son would never contend with the father, especially among the gods. But the point that the Creator of all things, the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Lord, is the Father of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we have deferred till the discussion of these points, in which we have undertaken to dispute against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, showing that He alone is the God proclaimed by Him.</p>

<p>But the apostle, writing to us with reference to the endurance of afflictions, says, <q>And this is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it is given to you on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer for His sake; having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me. If there is therefore any consolation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if any comfort of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if any communion of spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that you may be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, unanimous, thinking one thing. And if he is offered on the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and service of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, joying and rejoicing</q>  with the Philippians, to whom the apostle speaks, calling them <q>fellow-partakers of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022805"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;1:7</a></span> how does he say that they are of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and having a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Likewise, also, writing respecting Timothy and himself, he says, <q>For I have no one like-souled, who will nobly care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022806"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;2:20-21</a></span> </p>

<p>Let not the above-mentioned people, then, call us, by way of reproach, <q>natural men</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C8;&#x03C5;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>), nor the Phrygians  either; for these now call those who do not apply themselves to the new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <q>natural men</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C8;&#x03C5;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>), with whom we shall discuss in our remarks on <q>Prophecy.</q>  The perfect man ought therefore to practice <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and thence to haste to the divine friendship, fulfilling the commandments from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And loving one's enemies does not mean loving <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, or impiety, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or theft; but the thief, the impious, the adulterer, not as far as he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in respect of the actions by which he stains the name of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Assuredly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an activity, not an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>: and therefore it is not a work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now sinners are called enemies of God&mdash; enemies, that is, of the commands which they do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, as those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> become friends, the one named so from their fellowship, the others from their estrangement, which is the result of free choice; for there is neither enmity nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the enemy and the sinner. And the command <q>to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> nothing,</q> not as if the things to be desired did not belong to us, does not teach us not to entertain desire, as those suppose who teach that the Creator is different from the first <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as if creation was loathsome and bad (for such opinions are impious). But we say that the things of the world are <em>not our own</em>, not as if they were monstrous, not as if they did not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but because we do not continue among them for ever; being, in respect of possession, not ours, and passing from one to another in succession; but belonging to us, for whom they were made in respect of use, so long as it is necessary to continue with them. In accordance, therefore, with natural appetite, things disallowed are to be used rightly, avoiding all excess and inordinate affection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. The Love of All, Even of Our Enemies</h2>

<p>How great also is benignity! <q>Love your enemies,</q> it is said, <q>bless them who curse you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them who despitefully use you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022809"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44-45</a></span> and the like; to which it is added, <q>that you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven,</q> in allusion to resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, it is said, <q>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022810"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;5:25</a></span> The adversary is not the body, as some would have it, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and those assimilated to him, who walks along with us in the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who emulate his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in this earthly life. It is inevitable, then, that those who confess themselves to belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but find themselves in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> works, suffer the most hostile treatment. For it is written, <q>Lest he deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officers of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> kingdom.</q> <q>For I am persuaded that neither death,</q> through the assault of persecutors, <q>nor life</q> in this world, <q>nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> ones, <q>nor powers</q> (and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> power is the life which he chose, for such are the powers and principalities of darkness belonging to him), <q>nor things present,</q> amid which we exist during the time of life, as the hope entertained by the soldier, and the merchant's gain, <q>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,</q> in consequence of the energy proper to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;opposes the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of him who acts according to free choice. <q>Creature</q> is synonymous with activity, being our work, and such activity <q>shall not be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022811"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse38">Romans&nbsp;8:38-39</a></span> You have got a compendious account of the gnostic <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. On Avoiding Offence</h2>

<p><q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we all have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q>&mdash; common <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in common things, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that there is one God. For he was writing to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; whence he adds, <q>But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) is not in all,</q> being communicated to few. And there are those who say that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is not promulgated among all, <q>lest our liberty prove a stumbling-block to the weak. For by your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he that is weak is destroyed.</q>  Should they say, <q>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, ought that to be bought?</q> adding, by way of interrogation, <q>asking no questions,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022813"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:25</a></span> as if equivalent to <q>asking questions,</q> they give a ridiculous interpretation. For the apostle says, <q>All other things buy out of the shambles, asking no questions,</q> with the exception of the things mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic epistle</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  <q>with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> which is written in the Acts of the Apostles, and conveyed to the faithful by the hands of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself. For they intimated <q>that they must of necessity abstain from things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which keeping themselves, they should do well.</q> It is a different matter, then, which is expressed by the apostle: <q>Have we not power to eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? But we have not used this power,</q> he says, <q>but bear all things, lest we should occasion hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ;</q> namely, by bearing about burdens, when it was necessary to be untrammelled for all things; or to become an example to those who wish to exercise <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, not encouraging each other to eat greedily of what is set before us, and not to consort inconsiderately with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And especially is it incumbent on those entrusted with such a dispensation to exhibit to <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> a pure example. <q>For though I be free from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, I have made myself servant to all,</q> it is said, <q>that I might gain all. And every one that strives for mastery is temperate in all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022815"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:19-25</a></span> <q>But the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022816"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:26</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>' sake, then, we are to abstain from what we ought to abstain. <q>Conscience, I say, not his own,</q> for it is endued with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <q>but that of the other,</q> lest he be trained badly, and by imitating in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, he become a despiser instead of a strong-minded man. <q>For why is my liberty judged of by another <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? For if I by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> am a partaker, why am I <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of for that for which I give thanks? Whatever you do, do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022817"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:28-31</a></span> &mdash; what you are commanded to do by the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Passages of Scripture Respecting the Constancy, Patience, and Love of the Martyrs</h2>

<p><q>With the heart man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him shall not be ashamed; that is, the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we preach: for if you confess the word with your mouth that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</q>  There is clearly described the perfect righteousness, fulfilled both in practice and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Wherefore we are <q>to bless those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us.

They were <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, received not the promise of God</q> (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., <q>alone</q>).

<h2>Chapter 17. Passages from Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians on Martyrdom</h2>

<p>Moreover, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle  Clement also, drawing a picture of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, says:  <q>For who that has sojourned among you has not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> your perfect and firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? And has not admired your sound and gentle <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>? And has not celebrated the munificent style of your hospitality? And has not felicitated your complete and sure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For you did all things impartially, and walked in the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and so forth.</p>

<p>Then more clearly: <q>Let us fix our eyes on those who have yielded perfect service to His magnificent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Let us take <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, who, being by his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> found righteous, was translated; and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, who, having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, was saved; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hospitality was called the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was the father of Isaac.</q> <q>For hospitality and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was saved from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>.</q> <q>For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved.</q> <q>From patience and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they walked about in goat-skins, and sheep-skins, and folds of camels' hair, proclaiming the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We name His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Elias, and Eliseus, and Ezekiel, and John.</q></p>

<p><q>For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who for his free <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was called 'the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' was not elated by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but modestly said, 'I am dust and ashes.' <span class="stiki" id="note022835"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;18:27</a></span> And of Job it is thus written: 'Job was just and blameless, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, abstaining from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022836"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;1:1</a></span> He it was who overcame the tempter by patience, and at once testified and was testified to by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who keeps hold of humility, and says, <q>No one is pure from defilement, not even if his life were but for one day.</q>  <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, 'the servant who was faithful in all his house,' said to Him who uttered the oracles from the bush, 'Who am I, that You send me?

<p><q>David too, of whom the Lord, testifying, says, 'I found a man after my own heart, David the son of Jesse. With my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil I anointed him.'  But he also says to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, 'Pity me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to Your mercy; and according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my transgression, and my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ever before me.'</q>  Then, alluding to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not subject to the law, in the exercise of the moderation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he adds, <q>Against You only have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in Your sight.</q>  For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> somewhere says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is a lamp, searching the recesses of the belly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022842"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;20:27</a></span> And the more of a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> a man becomes by doing right, the nearer is the illuminating Spirit to him. <q>Thus the Lord draws near to the righteous, and none of the thoughts and reasonings of which we are the authors escape Him&mdash; I mean the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>,</q> the scrutinizer by His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> will of our heart, <q>whose blood was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>  for us. Let us therefore respect those who are over us, and reverence the elders; let us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the young, and let us teach the discipline of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For blessed is he who shall do and teach the Lord's commands worthily; and he is of a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> contemplative of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Let us direct our wives to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; let them exhibit,</q> says he, <q>the lovable disposition of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; let them show the guileless will of their meekness; let them manifest the gentleness of their tongue by silence; let them give their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not according to their inclinations, but equal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> to all that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God. Let our children share in the discipline that is in Christ; let them learn what humility avails before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; what is the power of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how lovely and great is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, saving all that walk in it holily; with a pure heart: for He is the Searcher of the thoughts and sentiments, whose breath is in us, and when He wills He will take it away.</q></p>

<p><q>Now all those things are confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.'Come, you children,' says the Lord, 'hearken to me, and I will teach you the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord. Who is the man that desires life, that loves to see good days? '  Then He subjoins the gnostic <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the numbers seven and eight.'Stop your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips from speaking guile. Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it.'  For in these words He alludes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), with abstinence from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the doing of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, teaching that it is to be perfected by word and deed. 'The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But the face of God is against those that do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to root out their memory from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard, and delivered him out of all his distresses.'  'Many are the stripes of sinners; but those who <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, mercy shall compass about.'</q>  <q>A multitude of mercy,</q> he nobly says, <q>surrounds him that trusts in the Lord.</q></p>

<p>For it is written in the Epistle to the Corinthians, <q>Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our foolish and darkened mind springs up to the light. By Him the Sovereign Lord wished us to taste the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</q> And, showing more expressly the peculiar nature of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he added: <q>These things, then, being clear to us, looking into the depths of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, we ought to do all things in order which the Sovereign Lord commanded us to perform at the appointed seasons. Let the wise man, then, show his wisdom not in words only, but in good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> not testify to himself, but allow testimony to be borne to him by another. Let not him who is pure in the flesh boast, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is another who furnishes him with continence. You see, brethren, that the more we are subjected to peril, the more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are we counted worthy of.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 18. On Love, and the Repressing of Our Desires</h2>

<p><q>The decorous tendency of our philanthropy, therefore,</q> according to Clement, <q>seeks the common good;</q> whether by suffering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, or by teaching by deed and word&mdash;the latter being twofold, unwritten and written. This is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God and our neighbour. <q>This conducts to the height which is unutterable.  'Love covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note022849"><a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse20">James&nbsp;5:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> Love bears all things, suffers all things.' <span class="stiki" id="note022850"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> Love joins us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does all things in concord. In <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, all the chosen of God were perfected. Apart from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, nothing is well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Of its perfection there is no unfolding,</q> it is said. <q>Who is fit to be found in it, except those whom God counts worthy?</q> To the point the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> speaks, <q>If I give my body, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I am sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal.</q>  If it is not from a disposition determined by gnostic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that I shall testify, he means; but if through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and expected reward, moving my lips in order to testify to the Lord that I shall confess the Lord, I am a common man, sounding the Lord's name, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Him. <q>For there is the people that loves with the lips; and there is another which gives the body to be burned.</q> <q>And if I give all my goods in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>,</q> he says, not according to the principle of loving communication, but on account of recompense, either from him who has received the benefit, or the Lord who has promised; <q>and if I have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so as to remove mountains,</q> and cast away obscuring <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and be not faithful to the Lord from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <q>I am nothing,</q> as in comparison of him who testifies as a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, and the crowd, and being reckoned nothing better.</p>

<p><q>Now all the generations from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to this day are gone. But they who have been perfected in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hold the place of the godly, who shall be manifested at the visitation of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Love permits not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but if it fall into any such case, by reason of the interference of the adversary, in imitation of David, it will sing: <q>I will confess unto the Lord, and it will please Him above a young bullock that has horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it, and be glad.</q> For he says, <q>Sacrifice to God a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay to the Lord your vows; and call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.</q>  <q>For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken spirit.</q> </p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> then, being good, <q>is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> it is said. <span class="stiki" id="note022854"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:8,&nbsp;16</a></span> Whose <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> works no ill to his neighbour,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022855"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> neither injuring nor revenging ever, but, in a word, doing good to all according to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Love is,</q> then, <q>the fulfilling of the law;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022856"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> like as Christ, that is the presence of the Lord who loves us; and our loving teaching of, and discipline according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. By <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, then, the commands not to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> one's neighbour's wife, are fulfilled, [these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> being] formerly prohibited by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>The same work, then, presents a difference, according as it is done by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or accomplished by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and is wrought by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Rightly, therefore, their rewards are different. To the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <q>are prepared what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man;</q> but to him who has exercised simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He testifies a hundredfold in return for what he has left&mdash;a promise which has turned out to fall within <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comprehension.</p>

<p>Come to this point, I recollect one who called himself a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. For, expounding the words, <q>But I say unto you, he that looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022857"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> he thought that it was not bare desire that was condemned; but if through the desire the act that results from it proceeding beyond the desire is accomplished in it. For dream employs phantasy and the body. Accordingly, the historians relate the following decision of Bocchoris the just.  A youth, falling in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with a courtezan, persuades the girl, for a stipulated reward, to come to him next day. But his desire being unexpectedly satiated, by laying hold of the girl in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, by anticipation, when the object of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> came according to stipulation, he prohibited her from coming in. But she, on learning what had taken place, demanded the reward, saying that in this way she had sated the lover's desire. They came accordingly to the judge. He, ordering the youth to hold out the purse containing the reward in the sun, bade the courtezan take hold of the shadow; facetiously bidding him pay the image of a reward for the image of an embrace.</p>

<p>Accordingly one dreams, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> assenting to the vision. But he dreams waking, who looks so as to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; not only, as that <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> said, if along with the sight of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> in his mind intercourse, for this is already the act of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; but if one looks on beauty of person (the Word says), and the flesh seem to him in the way of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> to be fair, looking on carnally and sinfully, he is judged because he admired. For, on the other hand, he who in chaste <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> looks on beauty, thinks not that the flesh is beautiful, but the spirit, admiring, as I judge, the body as an image, by whose beauty he transports himself to the Artist, and to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beauty; exhibiting the sacred <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, the bright impress of righteousness to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that wait on the ascension;  I mean the unction of acceptance, the quality of disposition which resides in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is gladdened by the communication of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which shone forth on the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the people could not look on. Wherefore he took a veil for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to those who looked carnally. For those, who demand toll, detain those who bring in any worldly things, who are burdened with their own <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But him that is free of all things which are subject to duty, and is full of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and of the righteousness of works, they pass on with their good wishes, blessing the man with his work. <q>And his life shall not fall away</q>&mdash; the leaf of the living tree that is nourished <q>by the water-courses.</q>  Now the righteous is likened to fruit-bearing trees, and not only to such as are of the nature  of tall-growing ones. And in the sacrificial oblations, according to the law, there were those who looked for blemishes in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. They who are skilled in such matters distinguish propension  (<span class="greek">&#x1F44;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03BE;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>); and assign the latter, as being irrational, to pleasures and licentiousness; and propension, as being a rational movement, they assign to the necessities of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Women as well as Men Capable of Perfection.</h2>

<p>In this perfection it is possible for man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> equally to share. It is not only <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, then, that heard from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I have spoken to you once, and twice, saying, I have seen this people, and lo, it is stiff-necked. Allow me to exterminate them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make you into a great and wonderful nation much greater than this;</q> who answers not regarding himself, but the common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: <q>By no means, O Lord; forgive this people their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or blot me out of the book of the living.</q>  How great was his perfection, in wishing to die together with the people, rather than be saved alone!</p>

<p>But Judith too, who became perfect among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in the siege of the city, at the entreaty of the elders went forth into the strangers' camp, despising all danger for her country's sake, giving herself into the enemy's hand in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and straightway she obtained the reward of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;though a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, prevailing over the enemy of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and gaining possession of the head of Holofernes. And again, Esther perfect by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who rescued <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the power of the king and the satrap's cruelty: a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone, afflicted with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>,  held back ten thousand armed  hands, annulling by her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the tyrant's decree; him indeed she appeased, Haman she restrained, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> she preserved scathless by her perfect <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I pass over in silence Susanna and the sister of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, since the latter was the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> associate in commanding the host, being superior to all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among the Hebrews who were in repute for their wisdom; and the former in her surpassing modesty, going even to death condemned by licentious admirers, remained the unwavering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<p>Dion, too, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, tells that a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Lysidica, through excess of modesty, bathed in her clothes; and that Philotera, when she was to enter the bath, gradually drew back her tunic as the water covered the naked parts; and then rising by degrees, put it on. And did not Le&aelig;na of Attica manfully bear the torture? She being privy to the conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton against Hipparchus, uttered not a word, though severely tortured. And they say that the Argolic <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, under the guidance of Telesilla the poetess, turned to flight the doughty Spartans by merely showing themselves; and that she produced in them fearlessness of death. Similarly speaks he who composed the Danais respecting the daughters of Danaus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And then the daughters of Danaus swiftly armed themselves, <br>Before the fair-flowing river, majestic Nile ,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and so forth.</p>

<p>And the rest of the poets sing of Atalanta's swiftness in the chase, of Anticlea's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for children, of Alcestis's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for her husband, of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of Mak&aelig;ria and of the Hyacinthides. What shall I say? Did not Theano the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> make such progress in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that to him who looked intently at her, and said, <q>Your arm is beautiful,</q> she answered <q>Yes, but it is not public.</q> Characterized by the same propriety, there is also reported the following reply.  When asked when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> after being with her husband attends the Thesmophoria, said, <q>From her own husband at once, from a stranger never.</q> Themisto too, of Lampsacus, the daughter of Zoilus, the wife of Leontes of Lampsacus, studied the Epicurean <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as Myia the daughter of Theano the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, and Arignote, who wrote the history of Dionysius.</p>

<p>And the daughters of Diodorus, who was called Kronus, all became dialecticians, as Philo the dialectician says in the <em>Menexenus</em>, whose names are mentioned as follows&mdash; Menexene, Argia, Theognis, Artemesia, Pantaclea. I also recollect a female Cynic,&mdash; she was called Hipparchia, a Maronite, the wife of Crates&mdash;in whose case the so-called dog-wedding was celebrated in the P&oelig;cile. Arete of Cyrene, too, the daughter of Aristippus, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> her son Aristippus, who was surnamed Mother-taught. Lastheneia of Arcis, and Axiothea of Phlius, studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Besides, Aspasia of Miletus, of whom the writers of comedy write much, was trained by Socrates in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, by Pericles in rhetoric. I omit, on account of the length of the discourse, the rest; enumerating neither the poetesses Corinna, Telesilla, Myia, and Sappho; nor the painters, as Irene the daughter of Cratinus, and Anaxandra the daughter of Nealces, according to the account of Didymus in the Symposiaci. The daughter of Cleobulus, the sage and monarch of the Lindii, was not ashamed to wash the feet of her father's guests. Also the wife of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the blessed Sarah, in her own person prepared the cakes baked in the ashes for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and princely maidens among the Hebrews fed sheep. Whence also the Nausica&auml; of Homer went to the washing-tubs.</p>

<p>The wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, then, will first choose to persuade her husband to be her associate in what is conducive to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And should that be found impracticable, let her by herself earnestly aim at <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, gaining her husband's consent in everything, so as never to do anything against his will, with exception of what is reckoned as contributing to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But if one keeps from such a mode of life either wife or maid-servant, whose heart is set on it; what such a person in that case plainly does is nothing else than determine to drive her away from righteousness and sobriety, and to choose to make his own house <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and licentious.</p>

<p>It is not then possible that man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> can be conversant with anything whatever, without the advantage of education, and application, and training; and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, we have said, depends not on others, but on ourselves above all. Other things one can repress, by waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them; but with what depends on one's self, this is entirely out of the question, even with the most strenuous persistence. For the gift is one conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not in the power of any other. Whence licentiousness should be regarded as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of no other one than of him who is guilty of licentiousness; and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, on the other hand, as the good of him who is able to practice it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. A Good Wife</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who, with propriety, loves her husband, Euripides describes, while admonishing,&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>That when her husband says anything, <br>She ought to regard him as speaking well if she say nothing; <br>And if she will say anything, to do her endeavour to gratify her husband.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again he subjoins the like:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And that the wife should sweetly look sad with her husband, <br>Should anything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befall him, <br>And have in common a share of sorrow and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then, describing her as gentle and kind even in misfortunes, he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And I, when you are ill, will, sharing your sickness bear it; <br>And I will bear my share in your misfortunes.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Nothing is bitter to me, <br>For with friends one ought to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, <br>For what else is friendship but this?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The marriage, then, that is consummated according to the word, is sanctified, if the union be under subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be conducted <q>with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, in full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, having hearts sprinkled from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and the body washed with pure water, and holding the confession of hope; for He is faithful that promised.</q> And the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of marriage ought never to be estimated either by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> or beauty, but by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p><q>Beauty,</q> says the tragedy,&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Helps no wife with her husband; <br>But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has helped many; for every good wife <br>Who is attached to her husband <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to practice sobriety.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then, as giving admonitions, he says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>First, then, this is incumbent on her who is endowed with <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, <br>That even if her husband be ugly, he must appear good-looking; <br>For it is for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not the eye, to judge.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>For with perfect propriety Scripture has said that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as <q>an help</q> to man. It is evident, then, in my opinion, that she will charge herself with remedying, by good sense and persuasion, each of the annoyances that originate with her husband in domestic economy. And if he do not yield, then she will endeavour, as far as possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to lead a sinless life; whether it be necessary to die, in accordance with reason, or to live; considering that God is her helper and associate in such a course of conduct, her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> defender and Saviour both for the present and for the future; making Him the leader and guide of all her actions, reckoning sobriety and righteousness her work, and making the favour of God her end. Gracefully, therefore, the apostle says in the Epistle to Titus, <q>that the elder <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should be of godly behaviour, should not be slanderers, not enslaved to much wine; that they should counsel the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, discreet, chaste, housekeepers, good, subject to their own husbands; that the word of God be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022868"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse3">Titus&nbsp;2:3-5</a></span> But rather, he says, <q>Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently, lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, who for one morsel surrendered his birth-right; and lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022869"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;13:14-16</a></span> And then, as putting the finishing stroke to the question about marriage, he adds: <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022870"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> And one aim and one end, as far as regards perfection, being demonstrated to belong to the man and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Peter in his Epistle says, <q>Though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; that the trial of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being much more precious than that of gold which perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> at the revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; whom, having not seen, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; in whom, though now you see Him not, yet believing, you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unspeakable, and full of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, receiving the end of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022871"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:6-9</a></span> Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rejoices for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake that he was <q>in labours, more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022872"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Description of the Perfect Man, or Gnostic</h2>

<p>Here I find perfection apprehended variously in relation to Him who excels in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly one is perfected as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and as patient, and as continent, and as a worker, and as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and as a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no one of men perfect in all things at once, while still <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, though according to the mere letter of the law, except Him alone who for us clothed Himself with humanity. Who then is perfect? He who professes abstinence from what is bad. Well, this is the way to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and to well-doing. But gnostic perfection in the case of the legal man is the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that he that is after the law may be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. For so he, who was after the law, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, foretold that it was necessary to hear in order that we might, according to the apostle, receive Christ, the fullness of the law. <span class="stiki" id="note022873"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:15</a>; <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> But now in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> attains proficiency not only by making use of the law as a step, but by understanding and comprehending it, as the Lord who gave the Covenants delivered it to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And if he conduct himself rightly (as assuredly it is impossible to attain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) by bad conduct); and if, further, having made an eminently right confession, he become a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, obtaining considerable renown as among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; not even thus will he be called perfect in the flesh beforehand; since it is the close of life which claims this appellation, when the gnostic <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> has first shown the perfect work, and rightly exhibited it, and having thankfully shed his blood, has yielded up the ghost: blessed then will he be, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> proclaimed perfect, <q>that the excellency of the power may be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of us,</q> as the apostle says. Only let us preserve <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: <q>troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not in despair; <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022874"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:8-9</a></span> For those who strive after perfection, according to the same apostle, must <q>give no offense in anything, but in everything approve themselves not to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And, as a consequence, also they ought to yield to men; for it is reasonable, on account of abusive <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>. Here is the specification: <q>in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, in pureness, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned, in the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022875"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3-7</a></span> that we may be the temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, purified <q>from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit.</q> <q>And I,</q> He says, <q>will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and you shall be to Me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.</q>  <q>Let us then,</q> he says, <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For though <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> beget pain, <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,</q> he says, <q>not that you were made sorry, but that you showed susceptibility to repentance. For you sorrowed after a godly sort, that you might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow works repentance unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world works death. For this same thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what earnestness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of yourselves; yea, what compunction; yea, what <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; yea, what desire; yea, what <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; yea, revenge! In all things you have showed yourselves clear in the matter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022877"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1-11</a></span> Such are the preparatory exercises of gnostic discipline. And since the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God Himself <q>gave some <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, till we all attain to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;</q>  we are then to strive to reach manhood as befits the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, and to be as perfect as we can while still abiding in the flesh, making it our study with perfect concord here to concur with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the restoration of what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> perfect nobleness and relationship, to the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that which perfectly depends on our perfection.</p>

<p>And now we perceive where, and how, and when the divine apostle mentions the perfect man, and how he shows the differences of the perfect. And again, on the other hand: <q>The manifestation of the Spirit is given for our profit. For to one is given the word of wisdom by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing through the same Spirit; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another discernment of spirits; to another diversities of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: and all these works the one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one according as He wills.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022879"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-11</a></span> Such being the case, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are perfect in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, the righteous in righteousness, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in confession, and others in preaching, not that they are not sharers in the common <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but are proficient in those to which they are appointed. For what man in his senses would say that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was not righteous? For what? Did not righteous men like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> prophesy?</p> <blockquote><p><q>For to one God has given warlike <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, <br>To another the accomplishment of the dance, <br>To another the lyre and song,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>says Homer. <q>But each has his own proper gift of God</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022881"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> &mdash; one in one way, another in another. But the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were perfected in all. You will find, then, if you choose, in their acts and writings, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, life, preaching, righteousness, purity, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. We must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, that if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is young in respect to time &mdash; having flourished immediately after the Lord's ascension&mdash; yet his writings depend on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, breathing and speaking of them. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are the explanation and fulfilment of the law; and therefore it was said to the Hebrews, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, neither shall you understand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022883"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> that is, unless you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is prophesied in the law, and oracularly delivered by the law, you will not understand the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which He by His coming expounded.</p>
<h2>Chapter 22. The True Gnostic Does Good, Not from Fear of Punishment or Hope of Reward, But Only for the Sake of Good Itself</h2>

<p>The man of understanding and perspicacity is, then, a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. And his business is not abstinence from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (for this is a step to the highest perfection), or the doing of good out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For it is written, <q>Whither shall I flee, and where shall I hide myself from Your presence? If I ascend into heaven, You are there; if I go away to the uttermost parts of the sea, there is Your right hand; if I go down into the depths, there is Your Spirit.</q>  Nor any more is he to do so from hope of promised recompense. For it is said, <q>Behold the Lord, and His reward is before His face, to give to every one according to his works; what eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not entered into the heart of man what God has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</q>  But only the doing of good out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and for the sake of its own excellence, is to be the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic's</a> choice. Now, in the person of God it is said to the Lord, <q>Ask of Me, and I will give the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance;</q>  teaching Him to ask a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> regal request&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men without price, that we may inherit and possess the Lord. For, on the contrary, to desire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about God for any practical purpose, that this may be done, or that may not be done, is not proper to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself suffices as the reason for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For I will dare aver that it is not because he wishes to be saved that he, who devotes himself to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for the sake of the divine science itself, chooses <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the exertion of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by exercise is prolonged to a perpetual exertion. And the perpetual exertion of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an intelligent being, which results from an uninterrupted process of admixture, and remains <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, a living substance. Could we, then, suppose any one proposing to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> whether he would choose the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God or everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and if these, which are entirely identical, were separable, he would without the least hesitation choose the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deeming that property of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ascends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, desirable, for its own sake. This, then, is the perfect man's first form of doing good, when it is done not for any advantage in what pertains to him, but because he judges it right to do good; and the energy being vigorously exerted in all things, in the very act becomes good; not, good in some things, and not good in others; but consisting in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing good, neither for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor, as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say, for <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, nor from reward either from men or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but so as to pass life after the image and likeness of the Lord.</p>

<p>And if, in doing good, he be met with anything adverse, he will let the recompense pass without resentment as if it were good, he being just and good <q>to the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> To such the Lord says, <q>Be, as your Father is perfect.</q></p>

<p>To him the flesh is dead; but he himself lives alone, having <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the sepulchre into a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple to the Lord, having turned towards God the old sinful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Such an one is no longer continent, but has reached a state of passionlessness, waiting to put on the divine image. <q>If you do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>,</q> it is said, <q>let no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it; and if you fast anoint yourself, that God alone may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q>  and not a single <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. Not even he himself who shows mercy ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he does show mercy; for in this way he will be sometimes merciful, sometimes not. And when he shall do good by habit, he will imitate the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of good, and his disposition will be his nature and his practice. There is no necessity for removing those who are raised on high, but there is necessity for those who are walking to reach the requisite goal, by passing over the whole of the narrow way. For this is to be drawn by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to become worthy to receive the power of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to run without hindrance. And if some <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, such an one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and pities their minds for its folly.</p>

<p>As is right, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself loves and teaches the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and instructs the whole creation to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God Almighty. And if such an one teaches to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he will not hold <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as a thing to be lost in any case, either awake or in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, or in any vision; since the habit never goes out of itself by falling from being a habit. Whether, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be said to be habit or disposition; on account of diverse sentiments never obtaining access, the guiding faculty, remaining unaltered, admits no alteration of appearances by framing in dreams visionary conceptions out of its movements by day. Wherefore also the Lord enjoins <q>to watch,</q> so that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may never be perturbed with passion, even in dreams; but also to keep the life of the night pure and stainless, as if spent in the day. For assimilation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as we can, is preserving the mind in its relation to the same things. And this is the relation of mind as mind.</p>

<p>But the variety of disposition arises from inordinate affection to material things. And for this reason, as they appear to me, to have called night Euphrone; since then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, released from the perceptions of sense, turns in on itself, and has a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> hold of intelligence (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>).  Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are for the most part celebrated by night, indicating the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, which takes place by night. <q>Let us not then sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night. But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and as an helmet the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022889"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:6-8</a></span> And as to what, again, they say of sleep, the very same things are to be understood of death. For each exhibits the departure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the one more, the other less; as we may also get this in Heraclitus: <q>Man touches night in himself, when dead and his light quenched; and alive, when he sleeps he touches the dead; and awake, when he shuts his eyes, he touches the sleeper.</q>  <q>For blessed are those that have seen the Lord,</q>  according to the apostle; <q>for it is high time to awake out of sleep. For now is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> nearer than when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</q>  By day and light he designates figuratively the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and by the armour of light metaphorically the promises.</p>

<p>So it is said that we ought to go washed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, clean and bright; and that this external adornment and purification are practiced for a sign. Now purity is to think <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thoughts. Further, there is the image of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which also was handed down to the poets from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And she having drawn water, and wearing on her body clean clothes.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>It is Penelope that is going to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And Telemachus, <br>Having washed his hands in the hoary sea, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to Athene.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>It was a custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to wash frequently after being in bed. It was then well said&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Be pure, not by washing of water, but in the mind.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, as I conceive it, is perfect pureness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and thoughts, and words too, and in its last degree sinlessness in dreams.</p>

<p>And sufficient purification to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I reckon, is thorough and sure repentance. If, condemning ourselves for our former actions, we go forward, after these things taking thought,  and divesting our mind both of the things which please us through the senses, and of our former transgressions.</p>

<p>If, then, we are to give the etymology of <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;</span>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, its signification is to be derived from <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>, placing; for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was formerly borne, now in one way, now in another, it settles in objects. Similarly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be explained etymologically, as the settling (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> respecting that which is.</p>

<p>But we desire to learn about the man who is always and in all things righteous; who, neither dreading the penalty proceeding from the law, nor fearing to entertain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the case of those who live with him and who prosecute the injured, nor dreading danger at the hands of those who do wrong, remains righteous. For he who, on account of these considerations, abstains from anything wrong, is not voluntarily kind, but is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> says, that the man who in his estimation was wise, <q>would not do wrong to any one for the sake of gain; for he could not persuade himself that he would escape detection.</q> So that, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he would not be detected, he would, according to him, do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And such are the doctrines of darkness. If, too, one shall abstain from doing wrong from hope of the recompense given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of righteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he is not on this supposition spontaneously good. For as <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> makes that man just, so reward makes this one; or rather, makes him appear to be just. But with the hope after death&mdash; a good hope to the good, to the bad the reverse&mdash; not only they who follow after Barbarian wisdom, but also the Pythagoreans, are acquainted. For the latter also proposed hope as an end to those who philosophize. Whereas Socrates  also, in the <em>Ph&aelig;do</em>, says <q>that good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> depart hence with a good hope;</q> and again, denouncing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, he sets against this the assertion, <q>For they live with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hope.</q> With him Heraclitus manifestly agrees in his dissertations concerning men: <q>There awaits man after death what they neither hope nor think.</q> Divinely, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes expressly, <q>Tribulation works, patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope makes not ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022897"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3-5</a></span> For the patience is on account of the hope in the future. Now hope is synonymous with the recompense and restitution of hope; which makes not ashamed, not being any more vilified.</p>

<p>But he who obeys the mere call, as he is called, neither for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor for enjoyments, is on his way to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>). For he does not consider whether any extrinsic lucrative gain or enjoyment follows to him; but drawn by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and led to what is requisite, practices <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. So that not even were we to suppose him to receive from God leave to do things forbidden with impunity; not even if he were to get the promise that he would receive as a reward the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the blessed; but besides, not even if he could persuade himself that God would be hoodwinked with reference to what he does (which is impossible), would he ever wish to do anything contrary to right reason, having once made choice of what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good and worthy of choice on its own account, and therefore to be loved. For it is not in the food of the belly, that we have heard good to be situated. But he has heard that <q>meat will not commend us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022898"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:8</a></span> nor marriage, nor abstinence from marriage in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> gnostic conduct. For the dog, which is an irrational animal, may be said to be continent, dreading as it does the uplifted stick, and therefore keeping away from the meat. But let the predicted promise be taken away, and the threatened dread cancelled, and the impending danger removed, and the disposition of such people will be revealed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. The Same Subject Continued</h2>

<p>For it is not suitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing itself, that they should apprehend in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gnostic manner the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that all things which were created for our use are good; as, for example, marriage and procreation, when used in moderation; and that it is better than good to become free of passion, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> by assimilation to the divine. But in the case of external things, agreeable or disagreeable, from some they abstain, from others not. But in those things from which they abstain from disgust, they plainly find fault with the creature and the Creator; and though in appearance they walk faithfully, the opinion they maintain is impious. That command, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q> needs neither the necessity arising from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, which compels to keep from things that are pleasant; nor the reward, which by promise persuades to restrain the impulses of passion.</p>

<p>And those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God through the promise, caught by the bait of pleasure, choose <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> not for the sake of the commandment, but for the sake of the promise. Nor will turning away from objects of sense, as a matter of necessary consequence, produce attachment to intellectual objects. On the contrary, the attachment to intellectual objects naturally becomes to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> an influence which draws away from the objects of sense; inasmuch as he, in virtue of the selection of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has chosen what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2;</span>), admiring generation, and by sanctifying the Creator sanctifying assimilation to the divine. But I shall free myself from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, let him say, O Lord, for the sake of alliance with You. For the economy of creation is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and all things are well administered: nothing happens without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. I must be in what is Yours, O Omnipotent One. And if I am there, I am near You. And I would be free of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that I may be able to draw near to You, and to be satisfied with little, practising Your just choice between things good and things like.</p>

<p>Right <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> and sacredly the apostle, teaching us the choice which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gracious, not in the way of rejection of other things as bad, but so as to do things better than what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has spoken, saying, <q>So he that gives his virgin in marriage does well; and he that gives her not does better; as far as respects seemliness and undistracted attendance on the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022899"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse38">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:38,&nbsp;35</a></span> </p>

<p>Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that things which are difficult are not essential; but that things which are essential have been graciously made easy of attainment by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore Democritus well says, that <q>nature and instruction</q> are like each other. And we have briefly assigned the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For instruction harmonizes man, and by harmonizing makes him natural; and it is no matter whether one was made such as he is by nature, or transformed by time and education. The Lord has furnished both; that which is by creation, and that which is by creating again and renewal through the covenant. And that is preferable which is advantageous to what is superior; but what is superior to everything is mind. So, then, what is really good is seen to be most pleasant, and of itself produces the fruit which is desired&mdash; tranquillity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>And he who hears Me,</q> it is said, <q>shall rest in peace, confident, and shall be calm without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022900"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse33">Proverbs&nbsp;1:33</a></span> <q>Rely with all your heart and your mind on God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022901"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;3:5</a></span> </p>

<p>On this wise it is possible for the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> already to have become God. <q>I said, You are gods, and  sons of the highest.</q> And Empedocles says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the wise become gods, writing as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>At last <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, minstrels, and physicians, <br>And the foremost among mortal men, approach; <br>Whence spring gods supreme in honours.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Man, then, genetically considered, is formed in accordance with the idea of the connate spirit. For he is not created formless and shapeless in the workshop of nature, where <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> the production of man is accomplished, both art and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> being common. But the individual man is stamped according to the impression produced in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the objects of his choice. Thus we say that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was perfect, as far as respects his formation; for none of the distinctive characteristics of the idea and form of man were wanting to him; but in the act of coming into being he received perfection. And he was justified by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; this was reaching manhood, as far as depended on him. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> lay in his choosing, and especially in his choosing what was forbidden. God was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<p>For production is twofold&mdash; of things procreated, and of things that grow. And manliness in man, who is subject to perturbation, as they say, makes him who partakes of it essentially fearless and invincible; and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the mind's satellite in patience, and endurance, and the like; and self-constraint and salutary sense are set over desire. But God is impassible, free of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, destitute of desire. And He is not free of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in the sense of avoiding what is terrible; or temperate, in the sense of having command of desires. For neither can the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God fall in with anything terrible, nor does God flee <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; just as He will not feel desire, so as to rule over desires. Accordingly that <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> saying was <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> uttered respecting us, <q>that man ought to become one;</q> for the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> himself is one, God being one in the immutable state of the perpetual flow  of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Now the Saviour has taken away <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in and with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> being <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of vengeance. For universally liability to feeling belongs to every kind of desire; and man, when deified purely into a passionless state, becomes a unit. As, then, those, who at sea are held by an anchor, pull at the anchor, but do not drag it to them, but drag themselves to the anchor; so those who, according to the gnostic life, draw God towards them, imperceptibly bring themselves to God: for he who reverences <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reverences himself. In the contemplative life, then, one in <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> attends to himself, and through his own spotless purification beholds the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God holily; for self-control, being present, surveying and contemplating itself uninterruptedly, is as far as possible assimilated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
<h2>Chapter 24. The Reason and End of Divine Punishments</h2>

<p>Now that is in our power, of which equally with its opposite we are masters&mdash;as, say to philosophize or not, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or disbelieve. In consequence, then, of our being equally masters of each of the opposites, what depends on us is found possible. Now the commandments may be done or not done by us, who, as is reasonable, are liable to praise and blame. And those, again, who are punished on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed by them, are punished for them alone; for what is done is past, and what is done can never be undone. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are accordingly forgiven by the Lord, not that they may be undone, but as if they had not been done. <q>But not all,</q> says <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>,  <q>but only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> involuntary and in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, are forgiven;</q> as would be the case were it a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that conferred such a boon. To such an one <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>You thought that I would be like you.</q>  But if we are punished for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we are punished not that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are done may be undone, but because they were done. But punishment does not avail to him who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, to undo his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that he may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, and that no one else fall into the like. Therefore the good God corrects for these three causes: First, that he who is corrected may become better than his former self; then that those who are capable of being saved by examples may be driven back, being admonished; and thirdly, that he who is injured may not be readily despised, and be apt to receive injury. And there are two methods of correction&mdash; the instructive and the punitive, which we have called the disciplinary. It ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, then, that those who fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>  are those who are subjected to discipline; for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> done before are remitted, and those done after are purged. It is in reference to the unbelieving that it is said, <q>that they are reckoned as the chaff which the wind drives from the face of the earth, and the drop which falls from a vessel.</q> </p>
<h2>Chapter 25. True Perfection Consists in the Knowledge and Love of God</h2>

<p><q>Happy he who possesses the culture of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and is not moved to the injury of the citizens or to wrong actions, but contemplates the undecaying order of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> nature, how and in what way and manner it subsists. To such the practice of base <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> attaches not,</q> Rightly, then, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, <q>that the man who devotes himself to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of ideas will live as a god among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; now the mind is the place of ideas, and God is mind.</q> He says that he who contemplates the unseen God lives as a god among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And in the <em>Sophist</em>, Socrates calls the stranger of Elea, who was a dialectician, <q>god:</q> <q>Such are the gods who, like stranger guests, frequent cities. For when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, rising above the sphere of generation, is by itself apart, and dwells amidst ideas,</q> like the Coryph&aelig;us in The&aelig;tetus, now become as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, it will be with Christ, being rapt in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, ever keeping in view the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in reality</p> <blockquote><p><q>Alone wise, while these flit like shadows.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p><q>For the dead bury their dead.</q> Whence Jeremiah says: <q>I will fill it with the earth-born dead whom mine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> has smitten.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022909"><a href="../bible/jer033.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;33:5</a></span> </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, being not a subject for demonstration, cannot be the object of science. But the Son is wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and all else that has affinity thereto. He is also susceptible of demonstration and of description. And all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, becoming collectively one thing, terminate in the same point&mdash; that is, in the Son. But He is incapable of being declared, in respect of the idea of each one of His powers. And the Son is neither simply one thing as one thing, nor many things as parts, but one thing as all things; whence also He is all things. For He is the circle of all powers rolled and united into one unity. Wherefore the Word is called the Alpha and the Omega, of whom alone the end becomes beginning, and ends again at the original beginning without any break. Wherefore also to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and by Him, is to become a unit, being indissolubly united in Him; and to disbelieve is to be separated, disjoined, divided.</p>

<p><q>Wherefore thus says the Lord, Every alien son is uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh</q> (that is, unclean in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>): <q>there shall not enter one of the strangers into the midst of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022910"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse9">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:9-10</a></span> He calls those that would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but would disbelieve, strangers. Only those who live purely being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, of all the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> tribes, those anointed to be <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, and kings, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, were reckoned more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Whence He commands them not to touch dead bodies, or approach the dead; not that the body was polluted, but that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore abominable. It was only, then, when a father and mother, a son and daughter died, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was allowed to enter, because these were related only by flesh and seed, to whom the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was indebted for the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his entrance into life. And they purify themselves seven days, the period in which Creation was consummated. For on the seventh day the rest is celebrated; and on the eighth he brings a propitiation, as is written in Ezekiel, according to which propitiation the promise is to be received. <span class="stiki" id="note022911"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse27">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:27</a></span> And the perfect propitiation, I take it, is that propitious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the purity which shows itself in universal <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, with the abandonment of the things of the world; in order to that grateful surrender of the tabernacle, which results from the enjoyment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest,  or the seven heavens, which some reckon one above the other; or whether also the fixed sphere which borders on the intellectual world be called the eighth, the expression denotes that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> ought to rise out of the sphere of creation and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. After these seven days, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For there is still <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of change, and it touches the seventh circle. The righteous Job says: <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022913"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> not naked of possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing; but, as a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, he departs naked of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad lives. For this was what was said, <q>Unless you be converted, and become as children,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022914"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;18:3</a></span> pure in flesh, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by abstinence from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>; showing that He would have us to be such as also He generated us from our mother&mdash; the water.  For the intent of one generation succeeding another is to immortalize by progress. <q>But the lamp of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be put out.</q>  That purity in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> partakes of, the all-wise <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> indicated, by employing repetition in describing the incorruptibility of body and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the person of Rebecca, thus: <q>Now the virgin was fair, and man had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022917"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;24:16</a></span> And Rebecca, interpreted, means <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.  This is in reality righteousness, not to desire other things, but to be entirely the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> temple of the Lord. Righteousness is peace of life and a well-conditioned state, to which the Lord dismissed her when He said, <q>Depart into peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022919"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;5:34</a></span> For Salem is, by interpretation, peace; of which our Saviour is enrolled King, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> king of Salem, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave bread and wine, furnishing <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> food for a type of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. And <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> is interpreted <q>righteous king;</q> and the name is a synonym for righteousness and peace. <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, however, supposes that Righteousness and her daughter Peace dwell stationed in the eighth sphere.</p>

<p>But we must pass from physics to ethics, which are clearer; for the discourse concerning these will follow after the treatise in hand. The Saviour Himself, then, plainly initiates us into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, according to the words of the tragedy: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Seeing those who see, he also gives the orgies.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And if you ask,</p> <blockquote><p><q>These orgies, what is their nature?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>You will hear again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is forbidden to mortals uninitiated in the Bacchic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And if any one will inquire curiously what they are, let him hear:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is not lawful for you to hear, but they are worth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; <br>The <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the God detest him who practices impiety.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is without beginning, is the perfect beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the producer of the beginning. As, then, He is being, He is the first principle of the department of action, as He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, of morals; as He is <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, on the other hand, He is the first principle of reasoning and of judgment. Whence also He alone is Teacher, who is the only Son of the Most High Father, the Instructor of men.</p>
<h2>Chapter 26. How the Perfect Man Treats the Body and the Things of the World</h2>

<p>Those, then, who run down created <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and vilify the body are wrong; not considering that the frame of man was formed erect for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heaven, and that the organization of the senses tends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and that the members and parts are arranged for good, not for pleasure. Whence this abode becomes receptive of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is most precious to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and is dignified with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, perfected with the perfection of the Saviour. And the succession of the three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who morally, physically, and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> occupies himself with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; and righteousness is the concord of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if one were to say that he disparaged the flesh, and generation on account of it, by quoting Isaiah, who says, <q>All flesh is grass, and all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man as the flower of grass: the grass is withered, and the flower has fallen; but the word of the Lord endures for ever;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022921"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6-8</a></span> let him hear the Spirit interpreting the matter in question by Jeremiah, <q>And I scattered them like dry sticks, that are made to fly by the wind into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. This is the lot and portion of your disobedience, says the Lord . As you have forgotten Me, and have trusted in lies, so will I discover your hinder parts to your face; and your disgrace shall be seen, your <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and your neighing,</q> and so on. <span class="stiki" id="note022922"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:24-27</a></span> For <q>the flower of grass,</q> and <q>walking after the flesh,</q> and <q>being carnal,</q> according to the apostle, are those who are in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is confessedly the better part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the body the inferior. But neither is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> good by nature, nor, on the other hand, is the body bad by nature. Nor is that which is not good straightway bad. For there are things which occupy a middle place, and among them are things to be preferred, and things to be rejected. The constitution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then, which has its place among things of sense, was necessarily composed of things diverse, but not opposite&mdash; body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Always therefore the good actions, as better, attach to the better and ruling spirit; and voluptuous and sinful actions are attributed to the worse, the sinful one.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise man and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as sojourning in the body, conducts itself towards it gravely and respectfully, not with inordinate affections, as about to leave the tabernacle if the time of departure summon. <q>I am a stranger in the earth, and a sojourner with you,</q> it is said.  And hence <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> says, that he apprehends that the election are strangers to the world, being supramundane by nature. But this is not the case. For all things are of one God. And no one is a stranger to the world by nature, their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> being one, and God one. But the elect man dwells as a sojourner, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things to be possessed and disposed of; and he makes use of the things which the Pythagoreans make out to be the threefold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. The body, too, as one sent on a distant pilgrimage, uses inns and dwellings by the way, having care of the things of the world, of the places where he halts; but leaving his dwelling-place and property without excessive emotion; readily following him that leads him away from life; by no means and on no occasion turning back; giving thanks for his sojourn, and blessing [God] for his departure, embracing the mansion that is in heaven. <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that, if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight,</q>  as the apostle says; <q>and we are willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> The rather is in comparison. And comparison obtains in the case of things that fall under resemblance; as the more valiant man is more valiant among the valiant, and most valiant among cowards. Whence he adds, <q>Wherefore we strive, whether present or absent, to be accepted with Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022925"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:9</a></span> that is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose work and creation are all things, both the world and things supramundane. I admire Epicharmus, who clearly says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Endowed with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you will not, in dying, <br>Suffer anything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The spirit will dwell in heaven above;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and the minstrel  who sings:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> flit about below the skies on earth, <br>In murderous pains beneath inevitable yokes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; <br>But those of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> dwell in the heavens, <br>Hymning in songs the Great, the Blessed One.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not then sent down from heaven to what is worse. For God works all things up to what is better. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has chosen the best life&mdash; the life that is from God and righteousness&mdash; exchanges earth for heaven. With reason therefore, Job, who had attained to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, said, <q>Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you can do all things; and nothing is impossible to You. For who tells me of what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, great and wonderful things with which I was unacquainted? And I felt myself vile, considering myself to be earth and ashes.</q>  For he who, being in a state of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, is sinful, <q>is earth and ashes;</q> while he who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, being assimilated as far as possible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is already spiritual, and so elect. And that Scripture calls the senseless and disobedient <q>earth,</q> will be made clear by <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying, in reference to Joachim and his brethren <q>Earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord; Write this man, as man <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022928"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse29">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:29-30</a></span> And another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says again, <q>Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022929"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2</a></span> calling understanding <q>ear,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, that of the man who has applied himself to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heaven and divine things, and in this way has become an Israelite, <q>heaven.</q> For again he calls him who has made <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and hardness of heart his choice, <q>earth.</q> And the expression <q>give ear</q> he derives from the <q>organs of hearing,</q> <q>the ears,</q> attributing carnal things to those who cleave to the things of sense. Such are they of whom Micah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Hear the word of the Lord, you peoples who dwell with pangs.</q>  And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, <q>By no means.

And clearly yet the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> teaches the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the gnostic proficiency, in these words: <q>And now, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what does the Lord God require of you, but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and walk in all His ways, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and serve Him alone?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022936"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:12</a></span> He asks of you, who hast the power of choosing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. What is it, then, that the Pythagoreans mean when they bid us <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the voice</q>? As seems to me, not that they thought the Divinity could not hear those who speak silently, but because they wished <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be right, which no one would be ashamed to make in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many. We shall, however, treat of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in due course by and by. But we ought to have works that cry aloud, as becoming <q>those who walk in the day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022937"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;13:13</a></span> <q>Let your works shine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022938"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> and behold a man and his works before his face. <q>For behold God and His works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022939"><a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;62:11</a></span> For the gnostic must, as far as is possible, imitate God. And the poets call the elect in their pages godlike and gods, and equal to the gods, and equal in sagacity to Zeus, and having counsels like the gods, and resembling the gods&mdash;nibbling, as seems to me, at the expression, <q>in the image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022940"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> </p>

<p>Euripides accordingly says, <q>Golden wings are round my back, and I am shod with the winged sandals of the Sirens; and I shall go aloft into the wide ether, to hold convene with Zeus.</q></p>

<p>But I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Spirit of Christ to wing me to my Jerusalem. For the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say that heaven is properly a city, but places here on earth are not cities; for they are called so, but are not. For a city is an important thing, and the people a decorous body, and a multitude of men regulated by law as the church by the word&mdash; a city on earth impregnable&mdash; free from tyranny; a product of the divine will on earth as in heaven. Images of this city the poets create with their pen. For the Hyperboreans, and the Arimaspian cities, and the Elysian plains, are commonwealths of just men. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> city placed as a pattern in heaven. </p>
