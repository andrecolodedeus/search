<h1>The Stromata (Book V)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; On Faith.</h2>

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> so much has been cursorily, as it were, written. We proceed now to the sequel, and must again contemplate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for there are some that draw the distinction, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has reference to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the Spirit. But it has escaped their notice that, in order to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and that He came, and how, and for what, and respecting His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; and we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Now neither is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Nor is the Father without the Son; for the Son is with the Father. And the Son is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teacher respecting the Father; and that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with whom also is the Son. Again, in order that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that it is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who teaches; for from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the Son is the Father. And the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son and Father, which is according to the gnostic rule&mdash; that which in reality is gnostic&mdash; is the attainment and comprehension of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>We, then, are those who are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in what is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who are <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> as to what is unknown; that is, <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> as to what is unknown and disbelieved by all, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by a few; and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, not describing actions by speech, but <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Happy is he who speaks in the ears of the hearing. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the ear of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And such the Lord intimates <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be, when He says, <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022943"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;11:15</a></span> so that by believing he may comprehend what He says, as He says it. Homer, too, the oldest of the poets, using the word <q>hear</q> instead of <q>perceive</q>&mdash; the specific for the generic term&mdash; writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Him most they heard.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>For, in fine, the agreement and harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of both  contribute to one end&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. We have in the apostle an unerring <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: <q>For I desire to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, in order that you may be strengthened; that is, that I may be comforted in you, by the mutual <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of you and me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022946"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;1:11-12</a></span> And further on again he adds, <q>The righteousness of God is revealed from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022947"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> The apostle, then, manifestly announces a twofold <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or rather one which admits of growth and perfection; for the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lies beneath as a foundation.  To those, therefore, who desire to be healed, and are moved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, He added, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022949"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;9:22</a></span> But that which is excellently built upon is consummated in the believer, and is again perfected by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which results from instruction and the word, in order to the performance of the commandments. Such were the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in whose case it is said that <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> removed mountains and transplanted trees.</q>  Whence, perceiving the greatness of its power, they asked <q>that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be added to them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022951"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;17:5</a></span> a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which salutarily bites the soil <q>like a grain of mustard,</q> and grows magnificently in it, to such a degree that the reasons of things sublime rest on it. For if one by nature <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> thinks, who calls intelligence of a superior order at once <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and kingship, and a creation worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Creator; and explains that near Him exists not power, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and nature and substance; and says that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the rational assent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exercising <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, but an undefined beauty, belonging immediately to the creature&mdash;the precepts both of the Old and of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are, then, superfluous, if one is saved by nature, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> would have it, and is a believer and an elect man by nature, as <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> thinks; and nature would have been able, one time or other, to have shone forth, apart from the Saviour's appearance. But were they to say that the visit of the Saviour was necessary, then the properties of nature are gone from them, the elect being saved by instruction, and purification, and the doing of good works. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, accordingly, who through hearing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the voice, which promised under the oak in Mamre, <q>I will give this land to you, and to your seed,</q> was either elect or not. But if he was not, how did he straightway <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as it were naturally? And if he was elect, their hypothesis is done away with, inasmuch as even previous to the coming of the Lord an election was found, and that saved: <q>For it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022952"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;15:6</a>; <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;4:3</a></span> For if any one, following <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, should dare to say that the Creator (<span class="greek">&#x0394;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>) saved the man that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on him, even before the advent of the Lord, (the election being saved with their own proper <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>); the power of the good Being will be eclipsed; inasmuch as late only, and subsequent to the Creator spoken of by them in words of good omen, it made the attempt to save, and by instruction, and in imitation of him. But if, being such, the good Being save, according to them; neither is it his own that he saves, nor is it with the consent of him who formed the creation that he essays <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but by force or fraud. And how can he any more be good, acting thus, and being posterior? But if the locality is different, and the dwelling-place of the Omnipotent is remote from the dwelling-place of the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who saves, having been the first to begin, is not inferior to that of the good God. From what has been previously <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> senseless: <q>For their paths are perverted, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not peace,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note022953"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;59:8</a></span> <q>But foolish and unlearned questions</q> the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exhorted to <q>avoid, because they gender strifes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022954"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:23</a></span> And &AElig;schylus exclaims:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>In what profits not, labour not in vain.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For that investigation, which accords with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which builds, on the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  the august <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be the best. Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that neither things which are clear are made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is day; nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether the stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those are so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as if what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is, when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to all of these modes, is removed, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is established. For we advance to them the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and comes to our help in writing, respecting each one of the points regarding which I investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to disbelieve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to demand <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from God as from men? Again, some questions demand the evidence of the senses,  as if one were to ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some admonition and rebuke, as the question if you ought to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. And there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were impious to think that the whole of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the economy in reference to a Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And perchance one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine Providence</a> being evident from the sight of all its skilful and wise works which are seen, some of which take place in order, and some appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and rightly. For the Word of the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is not the uttered word (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His power too, which is almighty and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine, and not incapable of being conceived by those who do not confess&mdash; the all-potent will. But since some are unbelieving, and some are disputatious, all do not attain to the perfection of the good. For neither is it possible to attain it without the exercise of free choice; nor does the whole depend on our own purpose; as, for example, what is defined to happen. <q>For by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are saved:</q> not, indeed, without good works; but we must, by being formed for what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, acquire an inclination for it. And we must possess the healthy mind which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in order to which we have the greatest need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, and of right teaching, and of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father to Him. For, bound in this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of sense by means of the body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means of the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> faculty itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things by the senses, he has fallen far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Spiritually, therefore, the apostle writes respecting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>For now we see as through a glass, but then face to face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022957"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> For the vision of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is given but to few. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says in the <em>Epinomis</em>, <q>I do not say that it is possible for all to be blessed and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; only a few. Whilst we live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good hope that after death I shall attain all.</q> To the same effect is what we find in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>No man shall see My face, and live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022958"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;33:20</a></span> For it is evident that no one during the period of life has been able to apprehend God clearly. But <q>the pure in heart shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022959"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> when they arrive at the final perfection. For since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> became too enfeebled for the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour is sent down&mdash; a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good&mdash; the secret and sacred token of the great Providence. <q>Where, then, is the scribe? Where is the searcher of this world? Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of this world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022960"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> it is said. And again, <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022961"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:19</a></span> plainly of those wise in their own eyes, and disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, <q>Thus says the Lord, Stand in the ways, and ask for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> paths, what is the good way, and walk in it, and you shall find expiation for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022962"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Ask, he says, and inquire of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, without contention and dispute. And on learning the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let us walk on the right way, without turning till we attain to what we desire. It was therefore with reason that the king of the Romans (his name was Numa), being a <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, first of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, erected a temple to Faith and Peace. <q>And to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, on believing, righteousness was reckoned.</q>  He, prosecuting the lofty <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of aerial phenomena, and the sublime <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is interpreted <q>sublime father.</q>  But afterwards, on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or in any other way recognised God to be superior to the creation, and all the order in it, he receives in addition the Alpha, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, become wise, and a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is interpreted, <q>elect father of sound.</q> For by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and the mind of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is elect. I cannot forbear praising exceedingly the poet of Agrigentum, who celebrates <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Friends, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, that there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the myths <br>Which I will relate. But very difficult to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <br>And irksome to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is the attempt of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore also the apostle exhorts, <q>that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> who profess to persuade, <q>but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022966"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:5</a></span> which alone without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, by mere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is able to save. <q>For the most approved of those that are reputable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to keep watch. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will apprehend the forgers and witnesses of lies,</q> says the Ephesian.  For he, having derived his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, is acquainted with the purification by fire of those who have led bad lives, which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> afterwards called the Conflagration (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03C0;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>), in which also they teach that each will arise exactly as he was, so treating of the resurrection; while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says as follows, that the earth at certain periods is purified by fire and water: <q>There have been many destructions of men in many ways; and there shall be very great ones by fire and water; and others briefer by innumerable causes.</q> And after a little he adds: <q>And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is a change of the objects which revolve about earth and heaven; and in the course of long periods there is the destruction of the objects on earth by a great conflagration.</q> Then he subjoins respecting the deluge: <q>But when, again, the gods deluge the earth to purify it with water, those on the mountains, herdsmen and shepherds, are saved; those in your cities are carried down by the rivers into the sea.</q> And we showed in the first Miscellany  that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Greeks are called thieves, inasmuch as they have taken without acknowledgment their principal <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. To which also we shall add, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who had obtained the superior rank, having sunk into pleasures, told to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>  the secrets which had come to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; while the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> concealed them, or rather, kept them against the coming of the Lord. Thence emanated the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and the revelation of high things; and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> having already been imparted to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Greeks, the treatment of dogma arose among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, sometimes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when they hit the mark, and sometimes erroneous, when they comprehended not the secret of the prophetic allegory. And this it is proposed briefly to indicate in running over the points requiring mention. Faith, then, we say, we are to show must not be inert and alone, but accompanied with investigation. For I do not say that we are not to inquire at all. For <q>Search, and you shall find,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022970"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> it is said.</p> <blockquote><p><q>What is sought may be captured, <br>But what is neglected escapes,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>according to Sophocles.</p>

<p>The like also says Menander the comic poet:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p>All things sought, <br>The wisest say, need anxious thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>But we ought to direct the visual faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> aright to discovery, and to clear away obstacles; and to cast clean away contention, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and strife, destined to perish miserably from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>For very beautifully does Timon of Phlius write:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And Strife, the Plague of Mortals, stalks vainly shrieking, <br>The sister of Murderous Quarrel and Discord, <br>Which rolls blindly over all things. But then <br>It sets its head towards men, and casts them on hope.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then a little below he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For who has set these to fight in deadly strife? <br>A rabble keeping pace with Echo; for, enraged at those silent, <br>It raised an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disease against men, and many perished;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>of the speech which denies what is false, and of the dilemma, of that which is concealed, of the Sorites, and of the Crocodilean, of that which is open, and of ambiguities and sophisms. To inquire, then, respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it tend not to strife, but to discovery, is salutary. For it is written in David, <q>The poor eat, and shall be filled; and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him. Your heart shall live for ever.</q>  For they who seek Him after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> search, praising the Lord, shall be filled with the gift that comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is figuratively termed the heart, which ministers life: for by the Son is the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>We ought not to surrender our ears to all who speak and write rashly. For cups also, which are taken hold of by many by the ears, are dirtied, and lose the ears; and besides, when they fall they are broken. In the same way also, those, who have polluted the pure hearing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by many trifles, at last becoming deaf to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, become useless and fall to the earth. It is not, then, without reason that we commanded boys to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> their relations, holding them by the ears; indicating this, that the feeling of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is engendered by hearing. And <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <q>is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022972"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:16</a></span> as <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> who by instruction is communicated to the faithful, <q>is faithful;</q>  and we must be allied to Him by divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: so that by like we may see like, hearing the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> guilelessly and purely, as children who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> us. And this was what he, whoever he was, indicated who wrote on the entrance to the temple at Epidaurus the inscription:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Pure he must be who goes within <br>The incense-perfumed fane.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And purity is <q>to think <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thoughts.</q> <q>Unless you become as these little children, you shall not enter,</q> it is said, <q>into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  For there the temple of God is seen established on three foundations&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; On Hope.</h2>

<p>Respecting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have adduced sufficient testimonies of writings among the Greeks. But in order not to exceed bounds, through eagerness to collect a very great many also respecting hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, suffice it merely to say that in the <em>Crito</em> Socrates, who prefers a good life and death to life itself, thinks that we have hope of another life after death.</p>

<p>Also in the <em>Ph&oelig;drus</em> he says, <q>That only when in a separate state can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> become partaker of the wisdom which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power; and when, having reached the end of hope by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, desire shall waft it to heaven, then,</q> says he, <q>does it receive the commencement of another, an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life.</q> And in the <em>Symposium </em>he says, <q>That there is instilled into all the natural <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of generating what is like, and in men of generating men alone, and in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man of the generation of the counterpart of himself. But it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man to do this without possessing the perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in which he will train the youth who have recourse to him.</q> And as he says in the <em>The&oelig;tetus</em>,<q>He will beget and finish men. For some procreate by the body, others by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q> since also with the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to teach and enlighten is called to regenerate; and <q>I have begotten you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022975"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> says the good apostle somewhere.</p>

<p>Empedocles, too, enumerates friendship among the elements, conceiving it as a combining <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Which do you look at with your mind; and don't sit gaping with your eyes.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Parmenides, too, in his poem, alluding to hope, speaks thus:&mdash; </p>  <blockquote><p><q>Yet look with the mind certainly on what is absent as present, <br>For it will not sever that which is from the grasp it has of that which is <br>Not, even if scattered in every direction over the world or combined.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Objects of Faith and Hope Perceived by the Mind Alone</h2>

<p>For he who hopes, as he who believes, sees intellectual objects and future things with the mind. If, then, we affirm that anything is just, and affirm it to be good, and we also say that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is something, yet we have never seen any of such objects with our eyes, but with our mind alone. Now the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> says, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022976"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> The Word is then to be contemplated by the mind. <q>Do you aver,</q> it was said,  <q>that there are any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>?</q> <q>Yes,</q> said I, <q>those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to contemplate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> In the <em>Ph&oelig;drus</em> also, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, shows it as an idea. Now an idea is a conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this the barbarians have termed the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. The words are as follow: <q>For one must then dare to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, especially in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being colourless, formless, and intangible, is visible only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  its guide.</q> Now the Word issuing forth was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of creation; then also he generated himself, <q>when the Word had become flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022979"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> that He might be seen. The righteous man will seek the discovery that flows from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to which if he hastes he prospers. For it is said, <q>To him that knocks, it shall be opened: ask, and it shall be given to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022980"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> <q>For the violent that storm the kingdom</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022981"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> are not so in disputatious speeches; but by continuance in a right life and unceasing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, are said <q>to take it by force,</q> wiping away the blots left by their previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><q>You may obtain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, even in great abundance.  <br>And him who toils God helps; <br>For the gifts of the Muses, hard to win, <br>Lie not before you, for any one to bear away.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is, then, the first lesson in walking according to the Word. An <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> man has sought, and having sought, he finds the teacher; and finding has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and believing has hoped; and henceforward having loved, is assimilated to what was loved&mdash; endeavouring to be what he first loved. Such is the method Socrates shows Alcibiades, who thus questions: <q>Do you not think that I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about what is right otherwise?</q> <q>Yes, if you have found out.</q> <q>But you don't think I have found out?</q> <q>Certainly, if you have sought.</q></p>

<p><q>Then you don't think that I have sought?</q> <q>Yes, if you think you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q>  So with the lamps of the wise <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, lighted at night in the great darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> signified by <q>night.</q> Wise <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, pure as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, understanding themselves to be situated amidst the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the world, kindle the light, and rouse the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and illumine the darkness, and dispel <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and seek <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and await the appearance of the Teacher.</p> <blockquote><p><q>The mob, then,</q> said I, <q>cannot become <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p><q>Many rod-bearers there are, but few Bacchi,</q> according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. <q>For many are called, but few chosen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022985"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> <q>Knowledge is not in all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022986"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:7</a></span> says the apostle. <q>And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may be delivered from unreasonable and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men: for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022987"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> And the <em>Poetics</em> of Cleanthes, the Stoic, writes to the following effect:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Look not to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, wishing to be suddenly wise, <br>And <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not the undiscerning and rash opinion of the many; <br>For the multitude has not an intelligent, or wise, or right judgment, <br>And it is in few men that you will find this.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And more sententiously the comic poet briefly says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is a shame to judge of what is right by much noise.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For they heard, I think, that excellent wisdom, which says to us, <q>Watch your opportunity in the midst of the foolish, and in the midst of the intelligent continue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022989"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;27:12</a></span> And again, <q>The wise will conceal sense.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022990"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse14">Proverbs&nbsp;10:14</a></span> For the many demand demonstration as a pledge of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not satisfied with the bare <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><q>But it is strongly incumbent to disbelieve the dominant <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <br>And as is enjoined by the assurance of our muse, <br>Know by dissecting the utterance within your breast.</q></p></blockquote>

<p><q>For this is habitual to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q> says Empedocles, <q>to wish to overbear what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by disbelieving it.</q> And that our tenets are probable and worthy of belief, the Greeks shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the point being more thoroughly investigated in what follows. For we are taught what is like by what is like.

<h2>Chapter 4. Divine Things Wrapped Up in Figures Both in the Sacred and in Heathen Writers</h2>

<p>But since they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> neither in what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> nor in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we ourselves reckoning what they claim as belonging to us, because all things are God's; and especially since what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proceeded from us to the Greeks, let us handle those things as they are capable of hearing. For intelligence or rectitude this great crowd estimates not by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but by what they are delighted with. And they will be pleased not more with other things than with what is like themselves. For he who is still blind and dumb, not having understanding, or the undazzled and keen vision of the contemplative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which the Saviour confers, like the uninitiated at the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, or the unmusical at dances, not being yet pure and worthy of the pure <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but still discordant and disordered and material, must stand outside of the divine <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>. <q>For we compare spiritual things with spiritual.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022995"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Wherefore, in accordance with the method of concealment, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred Word, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine and most necessary for us, deposited in the shrine of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, was by the Egyptians indicated by what were called among them <em>adyta</em>, and by the Hebrews by the veil. Only the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>&mdash; that is, those devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the desire of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to that which is alone divine&mdash; were allowed access to them. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also thought it not lawful for <q>the impure to touch the pure.</q></p>

<p>Thence the prophecies and oracles are spoken in enigmas, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are not exhibited incontinently to all and sundry, but only after certain purifications and previous instructions.</p> <blockquote><p><q>For the Muse was not then <br>Greedy of gain or mercenary; <br>Nor were Terpsichore's sweet, <br>Honey-toned, silvery soft-voiced <br>Strains made merchandise of.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Now those instructed among the Egyptians learned first of all that style of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> letters which is called Epistolographic; and second, the Hieratic, which the sacred <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> practice; and finally, and last of all, the Hieroglyphic, of which one kind which is by the first elements is literal (Kyriologic), and the other Symbolic. Of the Symbolic, one kind speaks literally by imitation, and another writes as it were figuratively; and another is quite allegorical, using certain enigmas.</p>

<p>Wishing to express Sun in writing, they makea circle; and Moon, a figure like the Moon, like its proper shape. But in using the figurative style, by transposing and transferring, by changing and by transforming in many ways as suits them, they draw characters. In relating the praises of the kings in theological myths, they write in anaglyphs.  Let the following stand as a specimen of the third species&mdash; the Enigmatic. For the rest of the stars, on account of their oblique course, they have figured like the bodies of serpents; but the sun, like that of a beetle, because it makes a round figure of ox-dung,  and rolls it before its face. And they say that this creature lives six months under ground, and the other division of the year above ground, and emits its seed into the ball, and brings forth; and that there is not a female beetle. All then, in a word, who have spoken of divine things, both Barbarians and Greeks, have veiled the first principles of things, and delivered the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in enigmas, and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, and allegories, and metaphors, and such like tropes.  Such also are the oracles among the Greeks. And the Pythian Apollo is called Loxias. Also the maxims of those among the Greeks called wise men, in a few sayings indicate the unfolding of matter of considerable importance. Such certainly is that maxim, <q>Spare Time:</q> either because life is short, and we ought not to expend this time in vain; or, on the other hand, it bids you spare your personal expenses; so that, though you live many years, necessaries may not fail you. Similarly also the maxim <q> <em>Know yourself</em></q> shows many things; both that you are mortal, and that you were born a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being; and also that, in comparison with the other excellences of life, you are of no account, because you say that you are rich or renowned; or, on the other hand, that, being rich or renowned, you are not honoured on account of your advantages alone. And it says, Know for what you were born, and whose image you are; and what is your <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and what your creation, and what your relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the like. And the Spirit says by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I will give you treasures, hidden, dark.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note022999"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;45:3</a></span> Now wisdom, hard to hunt, is the treasures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and unfailing riches. But those, taught in theology by those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the poets, philosophize much by way of a hidden sense. I mean Orpheus, Linus, Mus&aelig;us, Homer, and Hesiod, and those in this fashion wise. The persuasive style of poetry is for them a veil for the many. Dreams and signs are all more or less obscure to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not from jealousy (for it were wrong to conceive of God as subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>), but in order that research, introducing to the understanding of enigmas, may haste to the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus Sophocles the tragic poet somewhere says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And God I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be such an one, <br>Ever the revealer of enigmas to the wise, <br>But to the perverse bad, although a teacher in few words,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>putting bad instead of simple. Expressly then respecting all our Scripture, as if spoken in a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, it is written in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Hear, O My people, My law: incline your ear to the words of My mouth. I will open My mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, I will utter My problems from the beginning.</q>  Similarly speaks the noble apostle to the following effect: <q>Howbeit we speak wisdom among those that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; which none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For had they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023001"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6-8</a></span> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> did not exert themselves in contemning the appearance of the Lord. It therefore follows that it is the opinion of the wise among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which the apostle inveighs against. Wherefore he adds, <q>But we preach, as it is written, what eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what God has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. For God has revealed it to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023002"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> For he recognises the spiritual man and the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dispensed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the mind of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>But the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, for they are foolishness to him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023003"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> Now the apostle, in contradistinction to gnostic perfection, calls the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  <em>the foundation</em>, and sometimes <em>milk</em>, writing on this wise: <q>Brethren, I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, to babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have fed you with milk, not with meat: for you were not able. Neither yet are you now able. For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and strife, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023005"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1-3</a></span> Which things are the choice of those men who are sinners. But those who abstain from these things give their thoughts to divine things, and partake of gnostic food. <q>According to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> it is said, <q>given to me as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation. And another builds on it gold and silver, precious stones.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023006"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:10-13</a></span> Such is the gnostic superstructure on the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. But <q>the stubble, and the wood, and the hay,</q> are the additions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. <q>But the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.</q> In allusion to the gnostic edifice also in the Epistle to the Romans, he says, <q>For I desire to see you, that I may impart unto you a spiritual gift, that you may be established.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023007"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;1:11</a></span> It was impossible that gifts of this sort could be written without disguise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. On the Symbols of Pythagoras</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> were connected with the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the most recondite way. For instance, the Samian counsels <q>not to have a swallow in the house;</q> that is, not to receive a loquacious, whispering, garrulous man, who cannot contain what has been communicated to him. <q>For the swallow, and the turtle, and the sparrows of the field, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times of their entrance,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023008"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:6</a></span> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; and one ought never to dwell with trifles. And the turtle-dove murmuring shows the thankless <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> of fault-finding, and is rightly expelled the house.</p> <blockquote><p><q>Don't mutter against me, sitting by one in one place, another in another.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>The swallow too, which suggests the fable of Pandion, seeing it is right to detest the incidents reported of it, some of which we hear Tereus suffered, and some of which he inflicted. It pursues also the musical grasshoppers, whence he who is a persecutor of the word ought to be driven away.</p> <blockquote><p><q>By sceptre-bearing Here, whose eye surveys Olympus, <br>I have a rusty closet for tongues,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says Poetry. &AElig;schylus also says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But, I, too, have a key as a guard on my tongue.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again Pythagoras commanded, <q>When the pot is lifted off the fire, not to leave its mark in the ashes, but to scatter them;</q> and <q>people on getting up from bed, to shake the bed-clothes.</q> For he intimated that it was necessary not only to efface the mark, but not to leave even a trace of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and that on its ceasing to boil, it was to be composed, and all memory of injury to be wiped out. <q>And let not the sun,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023010"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> And he that said, <q>You shall not desire,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023011"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;20:17</a></span> took away all memory of wrong; for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is found to be the impulse of concupiscence in a mild <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, especially seeking irrational revenge. In the same way <q>the bed is ordered to be shaken up,</q> so that there may be no recollection of effusion in sleep,  or sleep in the day-time; nor, besides, of pleasure during the night. And he intimated that the vision of the dark ought to be dissipated speedily by the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not,</q> says David, teaching us that we ought not to assent to the impression, and not to follow it up by action, and so confirm <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</p>

<p>Again, <q>Don't sail on land</q> is a <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> saw, and shows that taxes and similar contracts, being troublesome and fluctuating, ought to be declined. Wherefore also the Word says that the tax-gatherers shall be saved with difficulty. </p>

<p>And again, <q>Don't wear a ring, nor engrave on it the images of the gods,</q> enjoins Pythagoras; as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> ages before enacted expressly, that neither a graven, nor molten, nor moulded, nor painted likeness should be made; so that we may not cleave to things of sense, but pass to intellectual objects: for familiarity with the sight disparages the reverence of what is divine; and to worship that which is immaterial by matter, is to dishonour it by sense.  Wherefore the wisest of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> decided that the temple of Athene should be hyp&aelig;thral, just as the Hebrews constructed the temple without an image. And some, in worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make a representation of heaven containing the stars; and so worship, although <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Let Us make man in Our image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023015"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> I think it worth while also to adduce the utterance of Eurysus the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, which is as follows, who in his book <em>On Fortune</em>, having said that the <q>Creator, on making man, took Himself as an exemplar,</q> added, <q>And the body is like the other things, as being made of the same material, and fashioned by the best workman, who wrought it, taking Himself as the archetype.</q> And, in fine, Pythagoras and his followers, with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also, and most of the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, were best acquainted with the Lawgiver, as may be concluded from their doctrine. And by a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> utterance of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, not without divine help, concurring in certain prophetic declarations, and, seizing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in portions and aspects, in terms not obscure, and not going beyond the explanation of the things, they honoured it on as certaining the appearance of relation with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Whence the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is like the torch of wick which men kindle, artificially stealing the light from the sun. But on the proclamation of the Word all that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light shone forth. Then in houses by night the stolen light is useful; but by day the fire blazes, and all the night is illuminated by such a sun of intellectual light.</p>

<p>Now Pythagoras made an epitome of the statements on righteousness in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he said, <q>Do not step over the balance;</q> that is, do not transgress equality in distribution, honouring <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> so.</p> <blockquote><p><q>Which friends to friends for ever, binds, <br>To cities, cities&mdash; to allies, allies, <br>For equality is what is right for men; <br>But less to greater ever hostile grows, <br>And days of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> begin,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>as is said with poetic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore the Lord says, <q>Take My yoke, for it is gentle and light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023016"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29-30</a></span> And on the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, striving for the pre-eminence, He enjoins equality with simplicity, saying <q>that they must become as little children.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023017"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;18:3</a></span> Likewise also the apostle writes, that <q>no one in Christ is bond or free, or Greek or Jew. For the creation in Christ Jesus is new, is equality, free of strife&mdash; not grasping&mdash; just.</q> For <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and jealousy, and bitterness, stand without the divine <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>.</p>

<p>Thus also those skilled in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> forbid <q>to eat the heart;</q> teaching that we ought not to gnaw and consume the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by idleness and by vexation, on account of things which happen against one's wishes. Wretched, accordingly, was the man whom Homer also says, wandering alone, <q>ate his own heart.</q> But again, seeing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> supposes two ways&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, too, similarly with all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; and seeing they call that one <q>narrow and confined</q> which is circumscribed according to the commandments and prohibitions, and the opposite one, which leads to perdition, <q>broad and roomy,</q> open to pleasures and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and say, <q>Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, and stands not in the way of sinners.</q>  Hence also comes the fable of Prodicus of Ceus about Virtue and Vice.  And Pythagoras shrinks not from prohibiting to walk on the public thoroughfares, enjoining the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of not following the sentiments of the many, which are crude and inconsistent. And Aristocritus, in the first book of his <em>Positions against Heracliodorus</em>, mentions a letter to this effect: <q>At&oelig;eas king of the Scythians to the people of Byzantium: Do not impair my revenues in case my mares drink your water;</q> for the Barbarian indicated <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> that he would make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on them. Likewise also the poet Euphorion introduces Nestor saying&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>We have not yet wet the Ach&aelig;an steeds in Simois.</q></p></blockquote>

<p> Therefore also the Egyptians place Sphinxes  before their temples, to signify that the doctrine respecting God is enigmatical and obscure; perhaps also that we ought both to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Divine Being: to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as gentle and benign to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>; to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him as inexorably just to the impious; for the sphinx shows the image of a wild beast and of a man together.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Mystic Meaning of the Tabernacle and Its Furniture</h2>

<p>It were tedious to go over all the Prophets and the Law, specifying what is spoken in enigmas; for almost the whole Scripture gives its utterances in this way. It may suffice, I think, for any one possessed of intelligence, for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the point in hand, to select a few examples.</p>

<p>Now concealment is evinced in the reference of the seven circuits around the temple, which are made mention of among the Hebrews; and the equipment on the robe, indicating by the various <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, which had reference to visible objects, the agreement which from heaven reaches down to earth. And the covering and the veil were variegated with blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen. And so it was suggested that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the elements contained the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For purple is from water, linen from the earth; blue, being dark, is like the air, as scarlet is like fire.</p>

<p>In the midst of the covering and veil, where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were allowed to enter, was situated the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the earth placed in the middle of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and from it came the fumes of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And that place intermediate between the inner veil, where the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> alone, on prescribed days, was permitted to enter, and the external court which surrounded it&mdash; free to all the Hebrews&mdash; was, they say, the middlemost point of heaven and earth. But others say it was the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the intellectual world, and that of sense. The covering, then, the barrier of popular unbelief, was stretched in front of the five pillars, keeping back those in the surrounding space.</p>

<p>So very <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> the five loaves are broken by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and fill the crowd of the listeners. For great is the crowd that keep to the things of sense, as if they were the only things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. <q>Cast your eyes round, and see,</q> says <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <q>that none of the uninitiated listen.</q> Such are they who think that nothing else exists, but what they can hold tight with their hands; but do not admit as in the department of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, actions and processes of generation, and the whole of the unseen. For such are those who keep by the five senses. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God is a thing inaccessible to the ears and like organs of this kind of people. Hence the Son is said to be the Father's face, being the revealer of the Father's character to the five senses by clothing Himself with flesh. <q>But if we live in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us also walk in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023021"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse25">Galatians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> <q>For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023022"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> the noble apostle says. Within the veil, then, is concealed the sacerdotal service; and it keeps those engaged in it far from those without.</p>

<p>Again, there is the veil of the entrance into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies. Four pillars there are, the sign of the sacred tetrad of the ancient covenants.  Further, the mystic name of four letters which was affixed to those alone to whom the adytum was accessible, is called Jave, which is interpreted, <q>Who is and shall be.</q> The name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, among the Greeks contains four letters.</p>

<p>Now the Lord, having come alone into the intellectual world, enters by His sufferings, introduced into the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Ineffable, ascending above every name which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by sound. The lamp, too, was placed to the south of the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>; and by it were shown the motions of the seven planets, that perform their revolutions towards the south. For three branches rose on either side of the lamp, and lights on them; since also the sun, like the lamp, set in the midst of all the planets, dispenses with a kind of divine music the light to those above and to those below.</p>

<p>The golden lamp conveys another enigma as a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not in respect of form alone, but in his casting light, <q>at sundry times and various manners,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023024"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> on those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and hope, and who see by means of the ministry of the First-born. And they say that the seven eyes of the Lord <q>are the seven spirits resting on the rod that springs from the root of Jesse.</q> </p>

<p>North of the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> was placed a table, on which there was <q>the exhibition of the loaves;</q> for the most nourishing of the winds are those of the north. And thus are signified certain seats of churches conspiring so as to form one body and one assemblage. </p>

<p>And the things recorded of the sacred ark signify the properties of the world of thought, which is hidden and closed to the many.</p>

<p>And those golden figures, each of them with six wings, signify either the two bears, as some will have it, or rather the two hemispheres. And the name <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> meant <q>much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> But both together have twelve wings, and by the zodiac and time, which moves on it, point out the world of sense. It is of them, I think, that Tragedy, discoursing of Nature, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Unwearied Time circles full in perennial flow, <br>Producing itself. And the twin-bears <br>On the swift wandering motions of their wings, <br>Keep the Atlantean pole.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Atlas,  the unsuffering pole, may mean the fixed sphere, or better perhaps, motionless <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But I think it better to regard the ark, so called from the Hebrew word <em>Thebotha</em>,  as signifying something else. It is interpreted, <em>one instead of one in all places</em>. Whether, then, it is the eighth region and the world of thought, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all-embracing, and without shape, and invisible, that is indicated, we may for the present defer saying. But it signifies the repose which dwells with the adoring spirits, which are meant by the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>.</p>

<p>For He who prohibited the making of a graven image, would never Himself have made an image in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things.  Nor is there at all any composite thing, and creature endowed with sensation, of the sort in heaven. But the face is a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the wings are the lofty ministers and energies of powers right and left; and the voice is delightsome <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in ceaseless <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Let it suffice that the mystic interpretation has advanced so far.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> robe is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the world of sense. The seven planets are represented by the five stones and the two carbuncles, for Saturn and the Moon. The former is southern, and moist, and earthy, and heavy; the latter aerial, whence she is called by some Artemis, as if &AElig;rotomos (cutting the air); and the air is cloudy. And cooperating as they did in the production of things here below, those that by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> are set over the planets are rightly represented as placed on the breast and shoulders; and by them was the work of creation, the first week. And the breast is the seat of the heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Differently, the stones might be the various phases of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; some occupying the upper, some the lower parts of the entire body saved. The three hundred and sixty bells, suspended from the robe, is the space of a year, <q>the acceptable year of the Lord,</q> proclaiming and resounding the stupendous manifestation of the Saviour. Further, the broad gold mitre indicates the regal power of the Lord, <q>since the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a></q> is the Savour. <span class="stiki" id="note023030"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;5:23</a></span> The mitre that is on it [i.e., the head] is, then, a sign of most princely rule; and otherwise we have heard it said, <q>The Head of Christ is the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023031"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse31">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:31</a></span> Moreover, there was the breastplate, comprising the ephod, which is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of work, and the oracle (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>); and this indicated the Word (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) by which it was framed, and is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of heaven, made by the Word,  and subjected to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Head of all things, inasmuch as it moves in the same way, and in a like manner. The luminous emerald stones, therefore, in the ephod, signify the sun and moon, the helpers of nature. The shoulder, I take it, is the commencement of the hand.</p>

<p>The twelve stones, set in four rows on the breast, describe for us the circle of the zodiac, in the four changes of the year. It was otherwise requisite that the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> should be placed beneath the Lord's head, because in both Testaments mention is made of the righteous. For were we to say that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were at once <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and righteous, we should say well, <q>since one and the self-same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> works in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023033"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> And as the Lord is above the whole world, yea, above the world of thought, so the name engraven on the plate has been regarded to signify, above all rule and authority; and it was inscribed with reference both to the written commandments and the manifestation to sense. And it is the name of God that is expressed; since, as the Son sees the goodness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God the Saviour works, being called the first principle of all things, which was imaged forth from the invisible God first, and before the ages, and which fashioned all things which came into being after itself. Nay more, the oracle  exhibits the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which by the Word cries and preaches, and the judgment that is to come; since it is the same Word which prophesies, and judges, and discriminates all things.</p>

<p>And they say that the robe prophesied the ministry in the flesh, by which He was seen in closer relation to the world. So the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, putting off his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> robe (the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the creation in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Him assenting that, what was made, was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>), washes himself, and puts on the other tunic&mdash; a holy-of-holies one, so to speak&mdash; which is to accompany him into the adytum; exhibiting, as seems to me, the Levite and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as the chief of other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (those bathed in water, and clothed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, and expecting their own individual abode), himself distinguishing the objects of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from the things of sense, rising above other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, hasting to the entrance to the world of ideas, to wash himself from the things here below, not in water, as formerly one was cleansed on being enrolled in the tribe of Levi. But purified already by the gnostic Word in his whole heart, and thoroughly regulated, and having improved that mode of life received from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to the highest pitch, being quite sanctified both in word and life, and having put on the bright array of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and received the ineffable inheritance of that spiritual and perfect man, <q>which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and it has not entered into the heart of man;</q> and having become son and friend, he is now replenished with insatiable <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> face to face. For there is nothing like hearing the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself, who by means of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> inspires fuller intelligence. For so it is said, <q>And he shall put off the linen robe, which he had put on when he entered into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place; and shall lay it aside there, and wash his body in water in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and put on his robe.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023035"><a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse23">Leviticus&nbsp;16:23-24</a></span> But in one way, as I think, the Lord puts off and puts on by descending into the region of sense; and in another, he who through Him has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> puts off and puts on, as the apostle intimated, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> stole. Thence, after the image of the Lord the worthiest were chosen from the sacred tribes to be <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, and those elected to the kingly office and to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> were anointed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Egyptian Symbols and Enigmas of Sacred Things</h2>

<p>Whence also the Egyptians did not entrust the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> they possessed to all and sundry, and did not divulge the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things to the profane; but only to those destined to ascend the throne, and those of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that were judged the worthiest, from their nurture, culture, and birth. Similar, then, to the Hebrew enigmas in respect to concealment, are those of the Egyptians also. Of the Egyptians, some show the sun on a ship, others on a crocodile. And they signify hereby, that the sun, making a passage through the delicious and moist air, generates time; which is symbolized by the crocodile in some other sacerdotal account. Further, at Diospolis in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, on the temple called Pylon, there was figured a boy as the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of production, and an old man as that of decay. A hawk, on the other hand, was the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a fish of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; and, according to a different symbolism, the crocodile of impudence. The whole <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, then, when put together, appears to teach this: <q>Oh you who are born and die, God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> impudence.</q></p>

<p>And there are those who fashion ears and eyes of costly material, and consecrate them, dedicating them in the temples to the gods&mdash; by this plainly indicating that God sees and hears all things. Besides, the lion is with them the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of strength and prowess, as the ox clearly is of the earth itself, and husbandry and food, and the horse of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and confidence; while, on the other hand, the sphinx, of strength combined with intelligence&mdash; as it had a body entirely that of a lion, and the face of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Similarly to these, to indicate intelligence, and memory, and power, and art, a man is sculptured in the temples. And in what is called among them the Komasi&aelig; of the gods, they carry about golden images&mdash; two dogs, one hawk, and one ibis; and the four figures of the images they call four letters. For the dogs are <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the two hemispheres, which, as it were, go round and keep watch; the hawk, of the sun, for it is fiery and destructive (so they attribute pestilential diseases to the sun); the ibis, of the moon, likening the shady parts to that which is dark in plumage, and the luminous to the light. And some will have it that by the dogs are meant the tropics, which guard and watch the sun's passage to the south and north. The hawk signifies the equinoctial line, which is high and parched with heat, as the ibis the ecliptic. For the ibis seems, above other animals, to have furnished to the Egyptians the first rudiments of the invention of number and measure, as the oblique line did of circles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Use of the Symbolic Style by Poets and Philosophers</h2>

<p>But it was not only the most highly intellectual of the Egyptians, but also such of other barbarians as prosecuted <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that affected the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> style. They say, then, that Idanthuris king of the Scythians, as Pherecydes of Syros relates, sent to Darius, on his passing the Ister in threat of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, instead of a letter, consisting of a mouse, a frog, a bird, a javelin, a plough. And there being a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in reference to them, as was to be expected, Orontopagas the Chiliarch said that they were to resign the kingdom; taking dwellings to be meant by the mouse, waters by the frog, air by the bird, land by the plough, arms by the javelin. But Xiphodres interpreted the contrary; for he said, <q>If we do not take our flight like birds, or like mice get below the earth, or like frogs beneath the water, we shall not escape their arrows; for we are not lords of the territory.</q></p>

<p>It is said that Anacharsis the Scythian, while asleep, covered the pudenda with his left hand, and his mouth with his right, to intimate that both ought to be mastered, but that it was a greater thing to master the tongue than voluptuousness.</p> 

<p>And why should I linger over the barbarians, when I can adduce the Greeks as exceedingly addicted to the use of the method of concealment? Androcydes the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> says the far-famed so-called Ephesian letters were of the class of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>. For he said that <span class="greek">&#x1F04;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> (shadowless) meant darkness, for it has no shadow; and <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> (shadowy) light, since it casts with its rays the shadow; and <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03BE;</span> if is the earth, according to an ancient' appellation; and <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C2;</span> is the year, in reference to the seasons; and <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03C2;</span> is the sun, which overpowers (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03B6;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>); and <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03B1;&#x1F34;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> voice. And then the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> intimates that divine things have been arranged in harmonious order&mdash; darkness to light, the sun to the year, and the earth to nature's processes of production of every sort. Also Dionysius Thrax, the grammarian, in his book, <em>Respecting the Exposition of the Symbolical Signification in Circles</em>, says expressly, Some signified actions not by words only, but also by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>: by words, as is the case of what are called the Delphic maxims, 'Nothing in excess,' 'Know yourself,' and the like; and by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, as the wheel that is turned in the temples of the gods, derived from the Egyptians, and the branches that are given to the worshippers. For the Thracian Orpheus says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Whatever works of branches are a care to men on earth, <br>Not one has one <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but all things <br>Revolve around; and it is not lawful to stand at one point, <br>But each one keeps an equal part of the race as they began.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The branches either stand as the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the first food, or they are that the multitude may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that fruits spring and grow universally, remaining a very long time; but that the duration of life allotted to themselves is brief. And it is on this account that they will have it that the branches are given; and perhaps also that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that as these, on the other hand, are burned, so also they themselves speedily leave this life, and will become fuel for fire.</p>

<p>Very useful, then, is the mode of symbolic interpretation for many purposes; and it is helpful to the right theology, and to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to the display of intelligence, and the practice of brevity, and the exhibition of wisdom. <q>For the use of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> speech is characteristic of the wise man,</q> appositely remarks the grammarian Didymus, <q>and the explanation of what is signified by it.</q> And indeed the most elementary instruction of children embraces the interpretation of the four elements; for it is said that the Phrygians call water Bedu, as also Orpheus says: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And bright water is poured down, the Bedu of the nymphs.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Dion Thytes also seems to write similarly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p>And taking Bedu, pour it on your hands, and turn to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the comic poet, Philydeus, understands by Bedu the air, as being (Biodoros) life-giver, in the following lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may inhale the salutary Bedu, <br>Which is the most essential part of health; <br>Inhale the pure, the unsullied air.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>In the same opinion also concurs Neanthes of Cyzicum, who writes that the Macedonian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> invoke Bedu, which they interpret to mean <em>the air</em>, to be propitious to them and to their children. And Zaps some have <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> taken for fire (from <span class="greek">&#x03B6;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>, <em>boiling</em>); for so the sea is called, as Euphorion, in his reply to Theoridas:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And Zaps, destroyer of ships, wrecked it on the rocks.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Dionysius Iambus similarly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Briny Zaps moans about the maddened deep.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly Cratinus the younger, the comic poet:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Zaps casts forth shrimps and little fishes.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Simmias of Rhodes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Parent of the Ignetes and the Telchines briny Zaps was born.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B8;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;</span> is the earth (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C7;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span>) spread forth to bigness. And Plectron, according to some, is the sky (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), according to others, it is the air, which strikes (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>) and moves to nature and increase, and which fills all things. But these have not read Cleanthes the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who expressly calls Plectron the sun; for darting his beams in the east, as if striking the world, he leads the light to its harmonious course. And from the sun it signifies also the rest of the stars.</p>

<p>And the Sphinx is not the comprehension  of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the revolution of the world, according to the poet Aratus; but perhaps it is the spiritual tone which pervades and holds together the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. But it is better to regard it as the ether, which holds together and presses all things; as also Empedocles says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But come now, first will I speak of the Sun, the first principle of all things, <br>From which all, that we look upon, has sprung, <br>Both earth, and billowy deep, and humid air; <br>Titan and Ether too, which binds all things around.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Apollodorus of Corcyra says that these lines were recited by Branchus the seer, when purifying the Milesians from plague; for he, sprinkling the multitude with branches of laurel, led off the hymn somehow as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Sing Boys Hecaergus and Hecaerga.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the people accompanied him, saying, <q>Bedu,  Zaps, Chthon, Plectron, Sphinx, Cnaxzbi, Chthyptes, Phlegmos, Drops.</q> Callimachus relates the story in iambics. Cnaxzbi is, by derivation, the plague, from its gnawing (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) and destroying (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), and <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x1FE6;&#x03C8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> is to consume with a thunderbolt. Thespis the tragic poet says that something else was signified by these, writing thus: <q>Lo, I offer to you a libation of white Cnaxzbi, having pressed it from the yellow nurses. Lo, to you, O two-horned Pan, mixing Chthyptes cheese with red honey, I place it on your sacred altars. Lo, to you I pour as a libation the sparkling gleam of Bromius.</q> He signifies, as I think, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> first milk-like nutriment of the four-and-twenty elements, after which solidified milk comes as food. And last, he teaches of the blood of the vine of the Word, the sparkling wine, the perfecting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of instruction. And Drops is the operating Word, which, beginning with elementary training, and advancing to the growth of the man, inflames and illumines man up to the measure of maturity.</p>

<p>The third is said to be a writing copy for children&mdash; <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;, &#x03C3;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x03BE;, &#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1F7D;&#x03C8;, &#x03B6;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C7;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span> . And it signifies, in my opinion, that by the arrangement of the elements and of the world, we must advance to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is more perfect, since <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is attained by force and toil; for <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03C8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> is to grasp. And the harmony of the world is meant by the Sphinx; and <span class="greek">&#x03B6;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C7;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span> means difficulty; and <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1F7D;&#x03C8;&#x03C2;</span> means at once the secret <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Lord and day. Well! Does not Epigenes, in his book on the <em>Poetry of Orpheus</em>, in exhibiting the peculiarities found in Orpheus,  say that by <q>the curved rods</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;</span>) is meant <q>ploughs;</q> and by the warp (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;</span>), the furrows; and the woof (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) is a figurative expression for the seed; and that the tears of Zeus signify a shower; and that the <q>parts</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x1FD6;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) are, again, the phases of the moon, the thirtieth day, and the fifteenth, and the new moon, and that Orpheus accordingly calls them <q>white-robed,</q> as being parts of the light? Again, that the Spring is called <q>flowery,</q> from its nature; and Night <q>still,</q> on account of rest; and the Moon <q>Gorgonian,</q> on account of the face in it; and that the time in which it is necessary to sow is called Aphrodite by the <q>Theologian.</q>  In the same way, too, the Pythagoreans figuratively called the planets the <q>dogs of Persephone;</q> and to the sea they applied the metaphorical appellation of <q>the tears of Kronus.</q> Myriads on myriads of enigmatical utterances by both poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are to be found; and there are also whole books which present the mind of the writer veiled, as that of Heraclitus <em>On Nature</em>, who on this very account is called <q>Obscure.</q> Similar to this book is the <em>Theology</em> of Pherecydes of Syrus; for Euphorion the poet, and the <em>Causes</em> of Callimachus, and the <em>Alexandra </em>of Lycophron, and the like, are proposed as an exercise in exposition to all the grammarians.</p>

<p>It is, then, proper that the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, on which it is our business to speak, should <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also obscurely and by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, as was evinced. Such are the injunctions of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>These common things, the sow, the hawk, the eagle, and the raven, are not to be eaten.</q>  For the sow is the emblem of voluptuous and unclean <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of food, and lecherous and filthy licentiousness in venery, always prurient, and material, and lying in the mire, and fattening for slaughter and destruction.</p>

<p>Again, he commands to eat that which parts the hoof and ruminates; <q>intimating,</q> says Barnabas, <q>that we ought to cleave to those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, and meditate in their heart on that portion of the word which they have received, to those who speak and keep the Lord's statutes, to those to whom meditation is a work of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and who ruminate on the word of the Lord. And what is the parted hoof? That the righteous walks in this world, and expects the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to come.</q> Then he adds, <q>See how well <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> enacted. But whence could they understand or comprehend these things? We who have rightly understood speak the commandments as the Lord wished; wherefore He <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> our ears and hearts, that we may comprehend these things. And when he says, 'You shall not eat the eagle, the hawk, the kite, and the crow;' he says, 'You shall not adhere to or become like those men who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to procure for themselves subsistence by toil and sweat, but live by plunder, and lawlessly.' For the eagle indicates <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, the hawk <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and the raven greed. It is also written, 'With the innocent man you will be innocent, and with the chosen choice, and with the perverse you shall pervert.'  It is incumbent on us to cleave to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because they that cleave to them shall be sanctified.</q> </p>

<p>Thence Theognis writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For from the good you will learn <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; <br>But if you mix with the bad, you will destroy any mind you may have.</q></p></blockquote> 

<p>And when, again, it is said in the ode, <q>For He has triumphed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a>: the horse and his rider has He cast into the sea;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023045"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;15:1</a></span> the many-limbed and brutal affection, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, with the rider mounted, who gives the reins to pleasures, <q>He has cast into the sea,</q> throwing them away into the disorders of the world. Thus also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in his book <em>On the Soul</em>, says that the charioteer and the horse that ran off&mdash; the irrational part, which is divided in two, into <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and concupiscence&mdash; fall down; and so the myth intimates that it was through the licentiousness of the steeds that Pha&euml;thon was thrown out. Also in the case of Joseph: the brothers having envied this young man, who by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was possessed of uncommon foresight, stripped off the coat of many colours, and took and threw him into a pit (the pit was empty, it had no water), rejecting the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man's varied <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, springing from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of instruction; or, in the exercise of the bare <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is according to the law, they threw him into the pit empty of water, selling him into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which was destitute of the divine word. And the pit was destitute of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; into which being thrown and stript of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he that had become unconsciously wise, stript of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, seemed like his brethren. Otherwise interpreted, the coat of many colours is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which takes its way into a yawning pit. <q>And if one open up or hew out a pit,</q> it is said, <q>and do not cover it, and there fall in there a calf or ass, the owner of the pit shall pay the price in money, and give it to his neighbour; and the dead body shall be his.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023046"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse33">Exodus&nbsp;21:33,&nbsp;36</a></span> Here add that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>: <q>The ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not understood Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023047"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> In order, then, that none of those, who have fallen in with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> taught by you, may become incapable of holding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and disobey and fall away, it is said, Be sure in the treatment of the word, and shut up the living spring in the depth from those who approach irrationally, but reach drink to those that thirst for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Conceal it, then, from those who are unfit to receive the depth of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and so cover the pit. The owner of the pit, then, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, shall himself be punished, incurring the blame of the others stumbling, and of being overwhelmed by the greatness of the word, he himself being of small capacity; or transferring the worker into the region of speculation, and on that account dislodging him from off-hand <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>And will pay money,</q> rendering a reckoning, and submitting his accounts to the <q><a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Will.</q></p>

<p>This, then, is the type of <q>the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which were until John;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023048"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;11:13</a>; <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;16:16</a></span> while he, though speaking more perspicuously as no longer prophesying, but pointing out as now present, Him, who was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolically</a> from the beginning, nevertheless said, <q>I am not worthy to loose the latchet of the Lord's shoe.</q>  For he confesses that he is not worthy to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> so great a Power; for it behooves those, who purify others, to free the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body and its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as the foot from the thong. Perhaps also this signified the final exertion of the Saviour's power toward us&mdash; the immediate, I mean&mdash; that by His presence, concealed in the enigma of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, inasmuch as he, by pointing out to sight Him that had been prophesied of, and indicating the Presence which had come, walking forth into the light, loosed the latchet of the oracles of the [old] economy, by unveiling the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>.</p>

<p>And the observances practiced by the Romans in the case of wills have a place here; those balances and small coins to denote <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and freeing of slaves, and rubbing of the ears. For these observances are, that things may be transacted with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and those for the dispensing of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; and the last, that he who happens to be near, as if a burden were imposed on him, should stand and hear and take the post of mediator.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Reasons for Veiling the Truth in Symbols</h2>

<p>But, as appears, I have, in my eagerness to establish my point, insensibly gone beyond what is requisite. For life would fail me to adduce the multitude of those who philosophize in a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> manner. For the sake, then, of memory and brevity, and of attracting to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>For only to those who often approach them, and have given them a trial by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in their whole life, will they supply the real <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> theology. They also wish us to require an interpreter and guide. For so they considered, that, receiving <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at the hands of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it well, we would be more earnest and less liable to deception, and those worthy of them would profit. Besides, all things that shine through a veil show the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> grander and more imposing; as fruits shining through water, and figures through veils, which give added reflections to them. For, in addition to the fact that things unconcealed are perceived in one way, the rays of light shining round reveal defects. Since, then, we may draw several meanings, as we do from what is expressed in veiled form, such being the case, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and unlearned man fails. But the Gnostior apprehends. Now, then, it is not wished that all things should be exposed indiscriminately to all and sundry, or the benefits of wisdom communicated to those who have not even in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> been purified in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, (for it is not allowed to hand to every chance comer what has been procured with such laborious efforts); nor are the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the word to be expounded to the profane.</p>

<p>They say, then, that Hipparchus the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, being guilty of writing the tenets of Pythagoras in plain language, was expelled from the school, and a pillar raised for him as if he had been dead. Wherefore also in the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> they call those dead who have fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, and have placed the mind in subjection to carnal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. <q>For what fellowship has righteousness and iniquity?</q> according to the divine apostle. <q>Or what communion has light with darkness? Or what concord has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>? Or what portion has the believer with the unbeliever?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023050"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> For the honours of the Olympians and of mortals lie apart. <q>Wherefore also go forth from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be to you for a Father, and you shall be my sons and daughters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023051"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17-18</a></span> </p>

<p>It was not only the Pythagoreans and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> then, that concealed many things; but the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> too say that they have things that may not be uttered, and do not allow all to peruse those writings. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> also say that by the first Zeno things were written which they do not readily allow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to read, without their first giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whether or not they are genuine <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Aristotle say that some of their treatises are esoteric, and others common and exoteric. Further, those who instituted the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, being <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, buried their doctrines in myths, so as not to be obvious to all. Did they then, by veiling <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinions, prevent the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> from handling them; and was it not more beneficial for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of realities to be concealed? But it was not only the tenets of the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> myths. But even those myths in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (in the <em>Republic</em>, that of Hero the Armenian; and in the <em>Gorgias</em>, that of &AElig;acus and Rhadamanthus; and in the <em>Ph&aelig;do</em>, that of Tartarus; and in the <em>Protagoras</em>, that of Prometheus and Epimetheus; and besides these, that of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the Atlantini and the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> in the Atlanticum) are to be expounded allegorically, not absolutely in all their expressions, but in those which express the general sense. And these we shall find indicated by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> under the veil of allegory. Also the association of Pythagoras, and the twofold intercourse with the associates which designates the majority, hearers (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>), and the others that have a genuine attachment to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>), yet signified that something was spoken to the multitude, and something concealed from them. Perchance, too, the twofold species of the Peripatetic teaching&mdash; that called probable, and that called knowable&mdash; came very near the distinction between opinion on the one hand, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on the other.</p> <blockquote><p><q>To win the flowers of fair renown from men, <br>Be not induced to speak anything more than right.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The Ionic muses accordingly expressly say, <q>That the majority of people, wise in their own estimation, follow minstrels and make use of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that many are bad, few good; but that the best pursue <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for the best make choice of the everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of men above all. But the multitude cram themselves like brutes, measuring <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by the belly and the pudenda, and the basest things in us.</q> And the great Parmenides of Elea is introduced describing thus the teaching of the two ways:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The one is the dauntless heart of convincing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; <br>The other is in the opinions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Opinion of the Apostles on Veiling the Mysteries of the Faith</h2>

<p>Rightly, therefore, the divine apostle says, <q>By revelation the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me (as I wrote before in brief, in accordance with which, when you read, you may understand my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ), which in other ages was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it is now revealed to His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023052"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;3:3-5</a></span> For there is an instruction of the perfect, of which, writing to the Colossians, he says, <q>We cease not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, and beseech that you may be filled with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that you may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; strengthened with all might according to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023053"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;1:9-11</a></span> And again he says, <q>According to the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is given me, that you may fulfil the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which has been hid from ages and generations, which now is manifested to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: to whom God wished to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what is the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> among the nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023054"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse25">Colossians&nbsp;1:25-27</a></span> So that, on the one hand, then, are the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which were hid till the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and were delivered by them as they received from the Lord, and, concealed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, were manifested to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. And, on the other hand, there is <q>the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> which is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in Christ; which in another place he has called the <q>foundation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023055"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse27">Colossians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> And again, as if in eagerness to divulge this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he thus writes: <q>Warning every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man (the whole man) perfect in Christ;</q> not every man simply, since no one would be unbelieving. Nor does he call every man who believes in Christ perfect; but he  says all the man, as if he said the whole man, as if purified in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not appertain to all, he expressly adds: <q>Being knit together in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and unto all the riches of the full assurance of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023057"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> <q>Continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, watching therein with thanksgiving.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023058"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;4:2</a></span> And thanksgiving has place not for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spiritual blessings alone, but also for the body, and for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the body. And he still more clearly reveals that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs not to all, by adding: <q>Praying at the same time for you, that God would open to us a door to speak the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for which I am bound; that I may make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as I ought to speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023059"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;4:3-4</a></span> For there were certainly, among the Hebrews, some things delivered unwritten. <q>For when you ought to be teachers for the time,</q> it is said, as if they had grown old in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, <q>you have again need that one teach you which be the first principles of the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food. For every one that partakes of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe, being instructed with the first lessons. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, who by reason of use have their senses exercised so as to distinguish between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us go on to perfection.</q> </p>

<p>Barnabas, too, who in person preached the word along with the apostle in the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, says, <q>I write to you most simply, that you may understand.</q> Then below, exhibiting already a clearer trace of gnostic tradition, he says, <q>What says the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to them? Lo, thus says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, Enter into the good land which the Lord God swore, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob; and you received for an inheritance that land, flowing with milk and honey.</q>  What says <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Learn, hope, it says, in Jesus, who is to be manifested to you in the flesh. For man is the suffering land; for from the face of the ground was the formation of Adam. What, then, does it say in reference to the good land, flowing with milk and honey? Blessed be our Lord, brethren, who has put into our hearts wisdom, and the understanding of His secrets. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Who shall understand the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> but the wise and understanding, and he that loves his Lord?</q> It is but for few to comprehend these things. For it is not in the way of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> that the Lord announced in a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is to me, and to the sons of my house;</q> placing the election in safety, and beyond anxiety; so that the things pertaining to what it has chosen and taken may be above the reach of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For he who has not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: for there is one good, the Father; and to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Father is death, as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, through participation in the power of the incorrupt One. And to be incorruptible is to participate in divinity; but revolt from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God brings corruption. Again the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>And I will give you treasures, concealed, dark, unseen; that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord .</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023062"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;45:3</a></span> Similarly David sings: <q>For, lo, You have loved <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the obscure and hidden things of wisdom have You showed me.</q>  <q>Day utters speech to day</q>  (what is clearly written), <q>and night to night proclaims <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> (which is hidden in a mystic veil); <q>and there are no words or utterances whose voices shall not be heard</q> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who said, <q>Shall one do what is secret, and I shall not see him?</q></p>

<p>Wherefore instruction, which reveals hidden things, is called illumination, as it is the teacher only who uncovers the lid of the ark, contrary to what the poets say, that <q>Zeus stops up the jar of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but opens that of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023065"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;15:29</a></span> designating the spiritual gift, and the gnostic communication, which being present he desires to impart to them present as <q>the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> sealed in the ages of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but now manifested by the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, in order to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> that is, those of the nations who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is. But only to a few of them is shown what those things are which are contained in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>Rightly then, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in the Epistles, treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says: <q>We must speak in enigmas; that should the tablet come by any mischance on its leaves either by sea or land, he who reads may remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, who is above all speech, all conception, all thought, can never be committed to writing, being inexpressible even by His own power. And this too <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> showed, by saying: <q>Considering, then, these things, take care lest some time or other you repent on account of the present things, departing in a manner unworthy. The greatest safeguard is not to write, but learn; for it is utterly impossible that what is written will not vanish.</q></p>

<p>Akin to this is what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, preserving the prophetic and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ancient secret from which the teachings that were good were derived by the Greeks: <q>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them who are perfect; but not the wisdom of this world, or of the princes of this world, that come to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023066"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> Then proceeding, he thus inculcates the caution against the divulging of his words to the multitude in the following terms: <q>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even to babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have fed you with milk, not with meat: for you were not yet able; neither are you now able. For you are yet carnal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023067"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1-3</a></span> </p>

<p>If, then, <q>the milk</q> is said by the apostle to belong to the babes, and <q>meat</q> to be the food of the full-grown, milk will be understood to be <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction&mdash; the first food, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And meat is the mystic <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; for this is the flesh and the blood of the Word, that is, the comprehension of the divine power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. <q>Taste and see that the Lord is Christ,</q>  it is said. For so He imparts of Himself to those who partake of such food in a more spiritual manner; when now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nourishes itself, according to the truth-loving <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the meat and drink of the divine Word. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, in the second book of the <em>Republic</em>, <q>It is those that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> not a sow, but some great and difficult <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> who ought to inquire respecting God. And the apostle writes, <q>Christ our passover was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023069"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> hard to procure, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Abstraction from Material Things Necessary in Order to Attain to the True Knowledge of God</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is unswerving abstraction from the body and its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. This is the really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And is not, on this account, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> rightly called by Socrates the practice of Death? For he who neither employs his eyes in the exercise of thought, nor draws anything from his other senses, but with pure mind itself applies to objects, practices the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. This is, then, the import of the silence of five years prescribed by Pythagoras, which he enjoined on his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; that, abstracting themselves from the objects of sense, they might with the mind alone contemplate the Deity. It was from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that the chief of the Greeks drew these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> tenets.  For he commands <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to be skinned and divided into parts. For the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the light, stript of the integuments of matter, devoid of the frivolousness of the body and of all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are acquired through vain and lying opinions, and divested of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh. But the most of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, clothed with what is perishable, like cockles, and rolled all round in a ball in their excesses, like hedgehogs, entertain the same ideas of the blessed and incorruptible God as of themselves. But it has escaped their notice, though they be near us, that God has bestowed on us ten thousand things in which He does not share: birth, being Himself unborn; food, He wanting nothing; and growth, He being always equal; and long life and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, He being <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incapable of growing old. Wherefore let no one <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that hands, and feet, and mouth, and eyes, and going in and coming out, and resentments and threats, are said by the Hebrews to be attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By no means; but that certain of these appellations are used more sacredly in an allegorical sense, which, as the discourse proceeds, we shall explain at the proper time.</p>

<p><q>Wisdom of all medicines is the Panacea,</q>  writes Callimachus in the <em>Epigrams</em>. <q>And one becomes wise from another, both in past times and at present,</q> says Bacchylides in the <em>P&oelig;ans;</em> <q>for it is not very easy to find the portals of unutterable words.</q> Beautifully, therefore, Isocrates writes in the <em>Panathenaic</em>, having put the question, <q>Who, then, are well trained?</q> adds, <q>First, those who manage well the things which occur each day, whose opinion jumps with opportunity, and is able for the most part to hit on what is beneficial; then those who behave becomingly and rightly to those who approach them, who take lightly and easily annoyances and molestations offered by others, but conduct themselves as far as possible, to those with whom they have intercourse, with consummate care and moderation; further, those who have the command of their pleasures, and are not too much overcome by misfortunes, but conduct themselves in the midst of them with manliness, and in a way worthy of the nature which we share; fourth&mdash; and this is the greatest&mdash; those who are not corrupted by prosperity, and are not put beside themselves, or made <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, but continue in the class of sensible people.</q> Then he puts on the top-stone of the discourse: <q>Those who have the disposition of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> well suited not to one only of these things, but to them all&mdash; those I assert to be wise and perfect men, and to possess all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how the Greeks deify the gnostic life (though not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to become acquainted with it)? And what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it is, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not even in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>. If, then, it is agreed among us that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the food of reason, <q>blessed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> are they,</q> according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>who hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for they shall be filled</q> with everlasting food. In the most wonderful harmony with these words, Euripides, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the drama, is found in the following words&mdash;making allusion, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, at once to the Father and the Son:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>To you, the Lord of all, I bring <br>Cakes and libations too, O Zeus, <br>Or Hades would you choose be called; <br>Do accept my offering of all fruits, <br>Rare, full, poured forth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For a whole burnt-offering and rare <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for us is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And that unwittingly he mentions the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, he will make plain, as he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For you who, 'midst the heavenly gods, <br>Jove's sceptre sway'st, dost also share <br>The rule of those on earth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he says expressly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Send light to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that fain would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <br>Whence conflicts spring, and what the root of ills, <br>And of the blessed gods to whom due <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> <br>Of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> we needs must pay, that so <br>We may from troubles find repose.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not then without reason that in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> that obtain among the Greeks, lustrations hold the first place; as also the laver among the Barbarians. After these are the minor  <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which have some foundation of instruction and of preliminary preparation for what is to come after; and the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in which nothing remains to be learned of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but only to contemplate and comprehend nature and things.</p>

<p>We shall understand the mode of purification by confession, and that of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by analysis, advancing by analysis to the first notion, beginning with the properties underlying it; abstracting from the body its physical properties, taking away the dimension of depth, then that of breadth, and then that of length. For the point which remains is a unit, so to speak, having position; from which if we abstract position, there is the conception of unity.</p>

<p>If, then, abstracting all that belongs to bodies and things called incorporeal, we cast ourselves into the greatness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and thence advance into immensity by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, we may reach somehow to the conception of the Almighty, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not what He is, but what He is not. And form and motion, or standing, or a throne, or place, or right hand or left, are not at all to be conceived as belonging to the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, although it is so written. But what each of these means will be shown in its proper place. The First Cause is not then in space, but above both space, and time, and name, and conception.</p>

<p>Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>Show Yourself to me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023073"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse18">Exodus&nbsp;33:18</a></span> &mdash; intimating most clearly that God is not capable of being taught by man, or expressed in speech, but to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only by His own power. For inquiry was obscure and dim; but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is from Him by the Son. Most clearly Solomon shall testify to us, speaking thus: <q>The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of man is not in me: but God gives me wisdom, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023074"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;30:2</a></span> Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, describing allegorically the divine <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, called it the tree of life planted in Paradise; which Paradise may be the world in which all things proceeding from creation grow. In it also the Word blossomed and bore fruit, being <q>made flesh,</q> and gave life to those <q>who had tasted of His graciousness;</q> since it was not without the wood of the tree that He came to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For our life was hung on it, in order that we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And Solomon again says: <q>She is a tree of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to those who take hold of her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023075"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;3:18</a></span> <q>Behold, I set before your face life and death, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to walk in His ways, and hear His voice, and trust in life. But if you transgress the statutes and the judgments which I have given you, you shall be destroyed with destruction. For this is life, and the length of your days, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God.</q> </p>

<p>Again: <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he came to the place which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> told him of on the third day, looking up, saw the place afar off.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023077"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;22:3-4</a></span> For the first day is that which is constituted by the sight of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and the second is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a>  best desire; on the third, the mind perceives spiritual things, the eyes of the understanding being opened by the Teacher who rose on the third day. The three days may be the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the seal,  in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. It is consequently afar off that he sees the place. For the region of God is hard to attain; which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> called the region of ideas, having learned from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that it was a place which contained all things universally. But it is seen by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> afar off, rightly, because of his being in the realms of generation, and he is immediately initiated by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Thence says the apostle: <q>Now we see as through a glass, but then face to face,</q> by those sole pure and incorporeal applications of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In reasoning, it is possible to divine respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if one attempt without any of the senses, by reason, to reach what is individual; and do not quit the sphere of existences, till, rising up to the things which transcend it, he apprehends by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, moving in the very confines of the world of thought, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.</p>

<p>Again, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, not allowing altars and temples to be constructed in many places, but raising one temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, announced that the world was only-begotten, as <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> says, and that God is one, as does not as yet appear to <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. And since the gnostic <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> does not circumscribe within space Him that cannot be circumscribed, he set up no image in the temple to be worshipped; showing that God was invisible, and incapable of being circumscribed; and somehow leading the Hebrews to the conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for His name in the temple. Further, the Word, prohibiting the constructing of temples and all <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, intimates that the Almighty is not contained in anything, by what He says: <q>What house will you build to Me? Says the Lord . <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is my throne,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023080"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> and so on. Similarly respecting <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: <q>I do not desire the blood of bulls and the fat of lambs,</q>  and what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the sequel forbids.</p>

<p>Most excellently, therefore, Euripides accords with these, when he writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>What house constructed by the workmen's hands, <br>With folds of walls, can clothe the shape divine?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> he thus speaks:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For God needs nought, if He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God. <br>These of the minstrels are the wretched myths.</q></p></blockquote>

<p><q>For it was not from need that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the world; that He might reap honours from men and the other gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, winning a kind of revenue from creation, and from us, fumes, and from the gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, their proper ministries,</q> says <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Most instructively, therefore, says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>The God that made the world, and all things in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped by men's hands, as if He needed anything; seeing that it is He Himself that gives to all breath, and life, and all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023082"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse24">Acts&nbsp;17:24-25</a></span> And Zeno, the founder of the Stoic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, says in this book of the <em>Republic</em>, <q>that we ought to make neither temples nor images; for that no work is worthy of the gods.</q> And he was not afraid to write in these very words: <q>There will be no need to build temples. For a temple is not worth much, and ought not to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. For nothing is worth much, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which is the work of builders and mechanics.</q> Rightly, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> too, recognising the world as God's temple, pointed out to the citizens a spot in the city where their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were to be laid up. <q>Let not, then, any one again,</q> he says, <q>consecrate temples to the gods. For gold and silver in other states, in the case of private individuals and in the temples, is an invidious possession; and ivory, a body which has abandoned the life, is not a sacred votive offering; and steel and brass are the instruments of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; but whatever one wishes to dedicate, let it be wood of one tree, as also stone for common temples.</q> Rightly, then, in the great Epistle he says: <q>For it is not capable of expression, like other branches of study. But as the result of great intimacy with this subject, and living with it, a sudden light, like that kindled by a coruscating fire, arising in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, feeds itself.</q> Are not these statements like those of Zephaniah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> took me, and brought me up to the fifth heaven, and I beheld <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> called Lords; and their diadem was set on in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and each of them had a throne sevenfold brighter than the light of the rising sun; and they dwelt in temples of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and hymned the ineffable, Most High God.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. God Cannot Be Embraced in Words or by the Mind</h2>

<p><q>For both is it a difficult task to discover the Father and Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and having found Him, it is impossible to declare Him to all. For this is by no means capable of expression, like the other subjects of instruction,</q> says the truth-loving <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. For he that had heard right well that the all-wise <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, ascending the mount for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, to the summit of intellectual objects, necessarily commands that the whole people do not accompany him. And when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> entered into the thick darkness where God was,</q> this shows to those capable of understanding, that God is invisible and beyond expression by words. And <q>the darkness</q>&mdash; which is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the unbelief and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the multitude&mdash; obstructs the gleam of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And again Orpheus, the theologian, aided from this quarter, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>One is perfect in himself, and all things are made the progeny of one,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>or, <q>are born;</q> for so also is it written. He adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Him <br>No one of mortals has seen, but He sees all.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And he adds more clearly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Him see I not, for round about, a cloud <br>Has settled; for in mortal eyes are small, <br>And mortal pupils&mdash; only flesh and bones grow there.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>To these statements the apostle will testify: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, caught up into the third heaven, and thence into Paradise, who heard unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to speak,</q>&mdash; intimating thus the impossibility of expressing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and indicating that what is divine is unutterable by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>  power; if, indeed, he begins to speak above the third heaven, as it is lawful to initiate the elect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> there. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (for the examples from the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which are many, are suggested now by the composition which, in accordance with promises previously given, waits the suitable time). For doubting, in <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, whether we ought to regard several worlds as to be understood by many heavens, or this one, he makes no distinction in the names, calling the world and heaven by the same name. But the words of the statement are as follows: <q>Whether, then, have we rightly spoken of one heaven, or of many and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>? It were more correct to say one, if indeed it was created according to the model.</q> Further, in the Epistle of the Romans to the Corinthians  it is written, <q>An ocean illimitable by men and the worlds after it.</q> Consequently, therefore, the noble apostle exclaims, <q>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023086"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> </p>

<p>And was it not this which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> meant, when he ordered unleavened cakes  to be made, intimating that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred mystic word, respecting the unbegotten and His powers, ought to be concealed? In confirmation of these things, in the Epistle to the Corinthians the apostle plainly says: <q>Howbeit we speak wisdom among those who are perfect, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the princes of this world, that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023088"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> And again in another place he says: <q>To the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023089"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> These things the Saviour Himself seals when He says: <q>To you it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  And again the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says that the Saviour spoke to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the word in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> says of Him: <q>He will open His mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.</q>  And now, by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the leaven, the Lord shows concealment; for He says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like leaven, which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023092"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;13:33</a></span> For the tripartite <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is saved by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, through the spiritual power hidden in it by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; or because the power of the word which is given to us, being strong  and powerful, draws to itself secretly and invisibly every one who receives it, and keeps it within himself, and brings his whole system into unity.</p>

<p>Accordingly Solon has written most wisely respecting God thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is most difficult to apprehend the mind's invisible measure <br>Which alone holds the boundaries of all things.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For <q>the divine,</q> says the poet of Agrigenturn, &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Is not capable of being approached with our eyes, <br>Or grasped with our hands; but the highway <br>Of persuasion, highest of all, leads to men's minds.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the apostle</a> says: <q>No man has seen God at any time. The only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023095"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> &mdash; calling invisibility and ineffableness the bosom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence some have called it the Depth, as containing and embosoming all things, inaccessible and boundless.</p>

<p>This discourse respecting God is most difficult to handle. For since the first principle of everything is difficult to find out, the absolutely first and oldest principle, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all other things being and having been, is difficult to exhibit. For how can that be expressed which is neither genus, nor difference, nor species, nor individual, nor number; nay more, is neither an event, nor that to which an event happens? No one can rightly express Him wholly. For on account of His greatness He is ranked as the All, and is the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Nor are any parts to be predicated of Him. For the One is indivisible; wherefore also it is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, not considered with reference to inscrutability, but with reference to its being without dimensions, and not having a limit. And therefore it is without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and name. And if we name it, we do not do so properly, terming it either the One, or the Good, or Mind, or Absolute Being, or Father, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or Creator, or Lord. We speak not as supplying His name; but for want, we use good names, in order that the mind may have these as points of support, so as not to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in other respects. For each one by itself does not express <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but all together are indicative of the power of the Omnipotent. For predicates are expressed either from what belongs to things themselves, or from their mutual relation. But none of these are admissible in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor any more is He apprehended by the science of demonstration. For it depends on primary and better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles. But there is nothing antecedent to the Unbegotten.</p>

<p>It remains that we understand, then, the Unknown, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, and by the word alone that proceeds from Him; as Luke in the Acts of the Apostles relates that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.  For in walking about, and beholding the objects of your worship, I found an altar on which was inscribed, To the Unknown God. Whom therefore you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> worship, Him declare I unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023097"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;17:22-23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. The Knowledge of God a Divine Gift, According to the Philosophers</h2>

<p>Everything, then, which falls under a name, is originated, whether they will or not. Whether, then, the Father Himself draws to Himself everyone who has led a pure life, and has reached the conception of the blessed and incorruptible nature; or whether the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> which is in us, by reaching the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the good, leaps and bounds over the barriers, as the gymnasts say; yet it is not without eminent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is winged, and soars, and is raised above the higher spheres, laying aside all that is heavy, and surrendering itself to its kindred element.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, too, in <em>Meno</em>, says that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is God-given, as the following expressions show: <q>From this argument then, O Meno, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is shown to come to those, in whom it is found, by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.</q> Does it not then appear that <q>the gnostic disposition</q> which has come to all is enigmatically called <q><a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>?</q> And he adds more explicitly: <q>If, then, in this whole treatise we have investigated well, it results that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is neither by nature, nor is it taught, but is produced by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, not without intelligence, in those in whom it is found.</q> Wisdom which is God-given, as being the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, rouses indeed our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and admits <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and repays the application of the elect with its crowning fellowship.</p>

<p>And now I will adduce <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself, who clearly deems it fit to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, discoursing on gods that are visible and born, in <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, he says: <q>But to speak of the other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their birth, is too much for us. But we must credit those who have formerly spoken, they being the offspring of the gods, as they said, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well their progenitors, although they speak without probable and necessary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>.</q> I do not think it possible that clearer testimony could be borne by the Greeks, that our Saviour, and those anointed to prophesy (the latter being called the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Lord being His own Son), are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> witnesses respecting divine things. Wherefore also they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, being inspired, he added. And were one to say in a more tragic vein, that we ought not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</p> <blockquote><p><q>For it was not Zeus that told me these things,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>yet let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was God Himself that promulgated the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> by His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And he, who announces what is his own, is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>No one,</q> says the Lord, <q>has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023098"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> This, then, is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, though it is announced and spoken <q>without probable and necessary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>,</q> but in the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <q>For unless you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> says the Lord, <q>you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023099"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;8:24</a></span> And again: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> has everlasting life.</q>  <q>Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.</q>  For trusting is more than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For when one has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>  that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is our teacher, he trusts  that his teaching is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And as <q>instruction,</q> according to Empedocles, <q>makes the mind grow,</q> so trust in the Lord makes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> grow.</p>

<p>We say, then, that it is characteristic of the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to vilify <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and run down <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to praise iniquity and felicitate a libidinous life. But now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if it is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> assent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is still the doer of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, the foundation of right conduct; and if Aristotle defines strictly when he teaches that <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span> is applied to the irrational creatures and to inanimate things, while <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span> is applicable to men only, let him correct those who say that God is the maker (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03C2;</span>) of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And what is done (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>), he says, is as good or as necessary. To do wrong, then, is not good, for no one does wrong except for some other thing; and nothing that is necessary is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. To do wrong, then, is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, so that it is not necessary. But the good differ especially from the bad in inclinations and good desires. For all depravity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is accompanied with want of restraint; and he who acts from passion, acts from want of restraint and from depravity.</p>

<p>I cannot help admiring in every particular that divine utterance: <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that enters not in by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter opens.</q> Then the Lord says in explanation, <q>I am the door of the sheep.</q>  Men must then be saved by learning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through Christ, even if they attain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. For now that is clearly shown <q>which was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to other ages, which is now revealed to the sons of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023105"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For there was always a natural manifestation of the one Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among all right-thinking men; and the most, who had not quite divested themselves of shame with respect to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, apprehended the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> beneficence in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. In fine, then, Xenocrates the Chalcedonian was not quite without hope that the notion of the Divinity <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even in the irrational creatures. And Democritus, though against his will, will make this avowal by the consequences of his <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>; for he represents the same images as issuing, from the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, on men and on the irrational animals.  Far from destitute of a divine idea is man, who, it is written in Genesis, partook of inspiration, being endowed with a purer <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> than the other animate creatures. Hence the Pythagoreans say that mind comes to man by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Aristotle avow; but we assert that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> inspires him who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. The Platonists hold that mind is an effluence of divine dispensation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and they place the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body. For it is expressly said by Joel, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>And it shall come to pass after these things, I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023107"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> But it is not as a portion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the Spirit is in each of us. But how this dispensation takes place, and what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is, shall be shown by us in the books on <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and in those on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <q>incredulity is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> at concealing the depths of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> according to Heraclitus; <q>for incredulity escapes from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Greek Plagiarism from the Hebrews</h2>

<p>Let us add in completion what follows, and exhibit now with greater clearness the plagiarism of the Greeks from the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is essentially body and spirit. You will find all this explicitly in their writings. Do not consider at present their allegories as the gnostic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> presents them; whether they show one thing and mean another, like the dexterous athletes. Well, they say that God pervades all being; while we call Him solely Maker, and Maker by the Word. They were misled by what is said in the book of Wisdom: <q>He pervades and passes through all by reason of His purity;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023108"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;7:24</a></span> since they did not understand that this was said of Wisdom, which was the first of the creation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>So be it, they say. But the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Pythagoras, nay more, Aristotle the Peripatetic, suppose the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of matter among the first principles; and not one first principle. Let them then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what is called matter by them, is said by them to be without quality, and without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and more daringly said by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to be non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. And does he not say very <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is one, in these very words: <q>Now, then, let our opinion be so. As to the first principle or principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, or what opinion we ought to entertain about all these points, we are not now to speak, for no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than on account of its being difficult to explain our sentiments in accordance with the present form of discourse.</q> But undoubtedly that prophetic expression, <q>Now the earth was invisible and formless,</q> supplied them with the ground of material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.</p>

<p>And the introduction of <q>chance</q> was hence suggested to <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, who misapprehended the statement, <q>Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.</q> And it occurred to Aristotle to extend Providence as far as the moon from this psalm: <q>Lord, Your mercy is in the heavens; and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> reaches to the clouds.</q>  For the explanation of the prophetic <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> had not yet been revealed previous to the advent of the Lord.</p>

<p>Punishments after death, on the other hand, and penal retribution by fire, were pilfered from the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> both by all the poetic Muses and by the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, accordingly, in the last book of the <em>Republic</em>, says in these express terms: <q>Then these men fierce and fiery to look on, standing by, and hearing the sound, seized and took some aside; and binding Arid&aelig;us and the rest hand, foot, and head, and throwing them down, and flaying them, dragged them along the way, tearing their flesh with thorns.</q> For the fiery men are meant to signify the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who seize and punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. <q>Who makes,</q> it is said, <q>His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits; His ministers flaming fire.</q>  It follows from this that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. For what is tortured or corrected being in a state of sensation lives, though said to suffer. Well! Did not <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the rivers of fire and the depth of the earth, and Tartarus, called by the Barbarians Gehenna, naming, as he does <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>,  Cocytus, and Acheron, and Pyriphlegethon, and introducing such corrective tortures for discipline?</p>

<p>But indicating <q>the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>of the little ones, and of the least, which see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and also the oversight reaching to us exercised by the tutelary <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  he shrinks not from writing, <q>That when all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have selected their several lives, according as it has fallen to their lot, they advance in order to Lachesis; and she sends along with each one, as his guide in life, and the joint accomplisher of his purposes, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> which he has chosen.</q> Perhaps also the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of Socrates suggested to him something similar.</p>

<p>Nay, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. having so heard from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, taught that the world was created.  And so <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> expressly said, <q>Whether was it that the world had no beginning of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or derived its beginning from some beginning? For being visible, it is tangible; and being tangible, it has a body.</q> Again, when he says, <q>It is a difficult task to find the Maker and Father of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>,</q> he not only showed that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was created, but points out that it was generated by him as a son, and that he is called its father, as deriving its being from him alone, and springing from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, too, hold the tenet that the world was created.</p>

<p>And that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> so spoken of by the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> asserts in the tenth book of the <em>Laws</em>, in these words: <q>Must we not say that spirit which pervades the things that are moved on all sides, pervades also heaven? Well, what? One or more? Several, say I, in reply for you. Let us not suppose fewer than two&mdash; that which is beneficent, and that which is able to accomplish the opposite.</q> Similarly in the <em>Ph&oelig;drus</em> he writes as follows: <q>Now there are other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> has mingled pleasure with the most things at present.</q> Further, in the tenth book of the <em>Laws</em>, he expressly emits that apostolic sentiment,  <q>Our contest is not with flesh and blood, but principalities, with powers, with the spiritual things of those which are in heaven;</q> writing thus: <q>For since we are agreed that heaven is full of many good beings; but it is also full of the opposite of these, and more of these; and as we assert such a contest is deathless, and requiring marvellous watchfulness.</q></p>

<p>Again the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the world of thought and the world of sense&mdash; the former archetypal, and the latter the image of that which is called the model; and assigns the former to the <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a>, as being perceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the world of sense to the number six. For six is called by the Pythagoreans marriage, as being the genital number; and he places in the <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a> the invisible heaven and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> earth, and intellectual light. For <q>in the beginning,</q> it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the heaven and the earth; and the earth was invisible.</q> And it is added, <q>And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023115"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1-3</a></span> And in the material cosmogony He creates a solid heaven (and what is solid is capable of being perceived by sense), and a visible earth, and a light that is seen. Does not <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> hence appear to have left the ideas of living creatures in the intellectual world, and to make intellectual objects into sensible species according to their genera? Rightly then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, that the body which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> calls <q>the earthly tabernacle</q> was formed of the ground, but that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was breathed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into man's face. For there, they say, the ruling faculty is situated; interpreting the access by the senses into the first man as the addition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore also man is said <q>to have been made in [God's] image and likeness.</q> For the image of God is the divine and royal Word, the impassible man; and the image of the image is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind. And if you wish to apprehend the likeness by another name, you will find it named in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, a divine correspondence. For he says, <q>Walk after the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keep His commandments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023116"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:4</a></span> And I reckon all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, servants and followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say that the end of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is to live agreeable to nature; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have shown in the second Miscellany. And Zeno the Stoic, borrowing from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and he from the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, says that all the good are friends of one another. For Socrates says in the <em>Ph&oelig;drus</em>, <q>that it has not been ordained that the bad should be a friend to the bad, nor the good be not a friend to the good;</q> as also he showed sufficiently in the <em>Lysis</em>, that friendship is never preserved in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. And the Athenian stranger similarly says, <q>that there is conduct pleasing and conformable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, based on one ancient ground-principle, That like loves like, provided it be within measure. But things beyond measure are congenial neither to what is within nor what is beyond measure. Now it is the case that God is the measure to us of all things.</q> Then proceeding, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>  adds: <q>For every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is like every other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man; and so being like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is liked by every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man and by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> At this point I have just recollected the following. In the end of the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em> he says: <q>You must necessarily assimilate that which perceives to that which is perceived, according to its original nature; and it is by so assimilating it that you attain to the end of the highest life proposed by the gods to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,  for the present or the future time.</q> For those have equal power with these. He, who seeks, will not stop till he find; and having found, he will wonder; and wondering, he will reign; and reigning, he will rest. And what? Were not also those expressions of Thales derived from these? The fact that God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> for ever, and that He is expressly called by us the Searcher of hearts, he interprets. For Thales being asked, What is the divinity? Said, What has neither beginning nor end. And on another asking, <q>If a man could elude the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine Being while doing anything?</q> said, <q>How could he who cannot do so while thinking?</q></p>

<p>Further, the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> recognises good as alone excellent, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as sufficient for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, when it says, <q>Behold, I have set before your eyes good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, life and death, that you may choose life.</q>  For it calls good, <q>life,</q> and the choice of it excellent, and the choice of the opposite <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> And the end of good and of life is to become a lover of God: <q>For this is your life and length of days,</q> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which tends to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And these points are yet clearer. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, in enjoining to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God and our neighbour, says, <q>that on these two commandments hang the whole law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> Such are the tenets promulgated by the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>; and before these, by Socrates, in the <em>Ph&oelig;drus</em>, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, <q>O Pan, and you other gods, give me to be beautiful within.</q> And in the <em>The&oelig;tetus</em> he says expressly, <q>For he that speaks well (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2;</span>) is both beautiful and good.</q> And in the <em>Protagoras</em> he avers to the companions of Protagoras that he has met with one more beautiful than Alcibiades, if indeed that which is wisest is most beautiful. For he said that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> beauty, and, on the contrary, that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deformity. Accordingly, Antipatrus the Stoic, who composed three books on the point, <q>That, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, only the beautiful is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> shows that, according to him, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and adduces several other <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> agreeing with the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. And by Aristobulus, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who is mentioned by the composer of the epitome of the books of the Maccabees, there were abundant books to show that the Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was derived from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> and from the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Let such be the case.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> plainly calls us brethren, as being of one God and one teacher, in the following words: <q>For you who are in the state are entirely brethren (as we shall say to them, continuing our story). But the God who formed you, mixed gold in the composition of those of you who are fit to rule, at your birth, wherefore you are most highly honoured; and silver in the case of those who are helpers; and steel and brass in the case of farmers and other workers.</q> Whence, of necessity, some embrace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those things to which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertains; and others matters of opinion. Perchance he prophesies of that elect nature which is bent on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; if by the supposition he makes of three natures he does not describe three politics, as some supposed: that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the silver; that of the Greeks, the third; and that of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, with whom has been mingled the regal gold, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the golden. </p>

<p>And exhibiting the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, he writes in the <em>The&aelig;tetus</em> in these words: <q>Let us now speak of the highest principles. For why should we speak of those who make an abuse of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? These <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither the way to the forum, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> they the court or the senate-house, or any other public assembly of the state. As for <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and decrees spoken or  written, they neither see nor hear them. But party feelings of political associations and public meetings, and revels with musicians [occupy them]; but they never even dream of taking part in affairs. Has any one conducted himself either well or ill in the state, or has anything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> descended to a man from his forefathers?&mdash; it escapes their attention as much as do the sands of the sea. And the man does not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all these things; but in reality his body alone is situated and dwells in the state,  while the man himself flies, according to Pindar, beneath the earth and above the sky, astronomizing, and exploring all nature on all sides.</q> </p>

<p>Again, with the Lord's saying, <q>Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay,</q> may be compared the following: <q>But to admit a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and destroy a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is in nowise lawful.</q> With the prohibition, also, against swearing agrees the saying in the tenth book of the <em>Laws:</em> <q>Let praise and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in everything be absent.</q></p>

<p>And in general, Pythagoras, and Socrates, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> say that they hear God's voice while closely contemplating the fabric of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, made and preserved unceasingly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they heard <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> say, <q>He said, and it was done,</q> describing the word of God as an act.</p>

<p>And founding on the formation of man from the dust, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> constantly term the body earthy. Homer, too, does not hesitate to put the following as an imprecation:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But may you all become earth and water.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>As Esaias says, <q>And trample them down as clay.</q> And Callimachus clearly writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>That was the year in which <br>Birds, fishes, quadrupeds, <br>Spoke like Prometheus' clay.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the same again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If you Prometheus formed, <br>And you are not of other clay.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Hesiod says of Pandora:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And bade Heph&aelig;stus, famed, with all his speed, <br>Knead earth with water, and man's voice and mind <br>Infuse.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, accordingly, define nature to be artificial fire, advancing systematically to generation. And God and His Word are by Scripture figuratively termed fire and light. But how? Does not Homer himself, is not Homer himself, paraphrasing the retreat of the water from the land, and the clear uncovering of the dry land, when he says of Tethys and Oceanus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For now for a long time they abstain from <br>Each other's bed and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Again, power in all things is by the most intellectual among the Greeks ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Epicharmus&mdash; he was a <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>&mdash; saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Nothing escapes the divine. This it behooves you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <br>He is our observer. To God nought is impossible.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the lyric poet:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And God from gloomy night <br>Can raise unstained light, <br>And can in darksome gloom obscure <br>The day's refulgence pure.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He alone who is able to make night during the period of day is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>In the <em>Ph&oelig;nomena</em> Aratus writes thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>With Zeus let us begin; whom let us ne'er, <br>Being men, leave unexpressed. All full of Zeus, <br>The streets, and throngs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and full the sea, <br>And shores, and everywhere we Zeus enjoy.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For we also are <br>His offspring; . . . . </q></p></blockquote>

<p>that is, by creation.</p> <blockquote><p><q>Who, bland to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <br>Propitious signs displays, and to their tasks <br>Arouses. For these signs in heaven He fixed, <br>The constellations spread, and crowned the year <br>With stars; to show to men the seasons' tasks, <br>That all things may proceed in order sure. <br>Him ever first, Him last too, they adore: <br>Hail Father, marvel great&mdash; great boon to men.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And before him, Homer, framing the world in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on the Vulcan-wrought shield, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>On it he fashioned earth, and sky, and sea, <br>And all the signs with which the heaven is crowned.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>For the Zeus celebrated in poems and prose compositions leads the mind up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And already, so to speak, Democritus writes, <q>that a few men are in the light, who stretch out their hands to that place which we Greeks now call the air. Zeus speaks all, and he hears all, and distributes and takes away, and he is king of all.</q> And more <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> the B&oelig;otian Pindar, being a <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a>, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>One is the race of gods and men, <br>And of one mother both have breath;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>that is, of matter: and names the one creator of these things, whom he calls Father, chief artificer, who furnishes the means of advancement on to divinity, according to merit.</p>

<p>For I pass over <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; he plainly, in the Epistle to Erastus and Coriscus, is seen to exhibit the Father and Son somehow or other from the Hebrew Scriptures, exhorting in these words: <q>In invoking by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, with not illiterate gravity, and with culture, the sister of gravity, God the author of all, and invoking Him by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as the Lord, the Father of the Leader, and author; whom if you study with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> spirit, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> And the address in the <em>Tim&oelig;us</em> calls the creator, Father, speaking thus: <q>You gods of gods, of whom I am Father; and the Creator of your works.</q> So that when he says, <q>Around the king of all, all things are, and because of Him are all things; and he [or that] is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and around the second are the things second in order; and around the third, the third,</q> I understand nothing else than the Holy Trinity to be meant; for the third is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and the Son is the second, by whom all things were made according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. </p> 

<p>And the same, in the tenth book of the <em>Republic</em>, mentions Eros the son of Armenius, who is Zoroaster. Zoroaster, then, writes: <q>These were composed by Zoroaster, the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth: having died in battle, and been in Hades, I learned them of the gods.</q> This Zoroaster, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, having been placed on the funeral pyre, rose again to life in twelve days. He alludes perchance to the resurrection, or perchance to the fact that the path for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to ascension lies through the twelve signs of the zodiac; and he himself says, that the descending pathway to birth is the same. In the same way we are to understand the twelve labours of Hercules, after which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> obtains release from this entire world.</p>

<p>I do not pass over Empedocles, who speaks thus physically of the renewal of all things, as consisting in a transmutation into the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of fire, which is to take place. And most plainly of the same opinion is Heraclitus of Ephesus, who considered that there was a world everlasting, and recognised one perishable&mdash; that is, in its arrangement, not being different from the former, viewed in a certain aspect. But that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the imperishable world which consists of the universal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to be everlastingly of a certain nature, he makes clear by speaking thus: <q>The same world of all things, neither any of the gods, nor any one of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, made. But there was, and is, and will be ever-living fire, kindled according to measure,  and quenched according to measure.</q> And that he taught it to be generated and perishable, is shown by what follows: <q>There are transmutations of fire&mdash;first, the sea; and of the sea the half is land, the half fiery vapour.</q> For he says that these are the effects of power. For fire is by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, which governs all things, changed by the air into moisture, which is, as it were, the germ of cosmical change; and this he calls sea. And out of it again is produced earth, and sky, and all that they contain. How, again, they are restored and ignited, he shows clearly in these words: <q>The sea is diffused and measured according to the same rule which subsisted before it became earth.</q> Similarly also respecting the other elements, the same is to be understood. The most renowned of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> teach similar doctrines with him, in treating of the conflagration and the government of the world, and both the world and man properly so called, and of the continuance of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, again, in the seventh book of the <em>Republic</em>, has called <q>the day here nocturnal,</q> as I suppose, on account of <q>the world rulers of this darkness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023127"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and the descent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the body, sleep and death, similarly with Heraclitus. And was not this announced, oracularly, of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, saying by David, <q>I slept, and slumbered; I awoke: for the Lord will sustain me;</q>  For He not only figuratively calls the resurrection of Christ rising from sleep; but to the descent of the Lord into the flesh he also applies the figurative term sleep. The Saviour Himself enjoins, <q>Watch;</q>  as much as to say, <q>Study how to live, and endeavour to separate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body.</q></p>

<p>And the Lord's day <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> speaks of in the tenth book of the <em>Republic</em>, in these words: <q>And when seven days have passed to each of them in the meadow, on the eighth they are to set out and arrive in four days.</q>  By the meadow is to be understood the fixed sphere, as being a mild and genial spot, and the locality of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>; and by the seven days each motion of the seven planets, and the whole practical art which speeds to the end of rest. But after the wandering orbs the journey leads to heaven, that is, to the eighth motion and day. And he says that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are gone on the fourth day, pointing out the passage through the four elements. But the seventh day is recognised as sacred, not by the Hebrews only, but also by the Greeks; according to which the whole world of all animals and plants revolve. Hesiod says of it:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The first, and fourth, and seventh day were held sacred.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And on the seventh the sun's resplendent orb.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Homer:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And on the seventh then came the sacred day.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The seventh was sacred.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It was the seventh day, and all things were accomplished.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And on the seventh morn we leave the stream of Acheron.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Callimachus the poet also writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It was the seventh morn, and they had all things done.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Among good days is the seventh day, and the seventh race.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The seventh is among the prime, and the seventh is perfect.</q></p></blockquote> 

<p>And:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Now all the seven were made in starry heaven, <br>In circles shining as the years appear.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The Elegies of Solon, too, intensely deify the seventh day.</p>

<p>And how? Is it not similar to Scripture when it says, <q>Let us remove the righteous man from us, because he is troublesome to us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023131"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse12">Wisdom&nbsp;2:12</a></span> when <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, all but predicting the economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, says in the second book of the <em>Republic</em> as follows: <q>Thus he who is constituted just shall be scourged, shall be stretched on the rack, shall be bound, have his eyes put out; and at last, having suffered all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, shall be crucified.</q> </p>

<p>And the Socratic Antisthenes, paraphrasing that prophetic utterance, <q>To whom have you likened me? Says the Lord,</q>  says that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is like no one; wherefore no one can come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him from an image.</q></p>

<p>Xenophon too, the Athenian, utters these similar sentiments in the following words: <q>He who shakes all things, and is Himself immoveable, is manifestly one great and powerful. But what He is in form, appears not. No more does the sun, who wishes to shine in all directions, deem it right to permit any one to look on himself. But if one gaze on him audaciously, he loses his eyesight.</q></p> <blockquote><p><q>What flesh can see with eyes the Heavenly, True, <br>Immortal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose dwelling is the poles? <br>Not even before the bright beams of the sun <br>Are men, as being mortal, fit to stand,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>the Sibyl had said before. Rightly, then, Xenophanes of Colophon, teaching that God is one and incorporeal, adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>One God there is 'midst gods and men supreme; <br>In form, in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unlike to mortal men.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But men have the idea that gods are born, <br>And wear their clothes, and have both voice and shape.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But had the oxen or the lions hands, <br>Or could with hands depict a work like men, <br>Were beasts to draw the semblance of the gods, <br>The horses would them like to horses sketch, <br>To oxen, oxen, and their bodies make <br>Of such a shape as to themselves belongs.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us hear, then, the lyric poet Bacchylides speaking of the divine:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Who to diseases dire  never succumb, <br>And blameless are; in nought resembling men.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And also Cleanthes, the Stoic, who writes thus in a poem on the Deity: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If you ask what is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the good, listen&mdash; <br>That which is regular, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, <br>Self-governing, useful, fair, fitting, <br>Grave, independent, always beneficial, <br>That feels no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or grief, profitable, painless, <br>Helpful, pleasant, safe, friendly, <br>Held in esteem, agreeing with itself: <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, <br>Humble, careful, meek, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, <br>Perennial, blameless, ever-during.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the same, tacitly vilifying the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of the multitude, adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Base is every one who looks to opinion, <br>With the view of deriving any good from it.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>We are not, then, to think of God according to the opinion of the multitude.</p> <blockquote><p><q>For I do not think that secretly, <br>Imitating the guise of a scoundrel, <br>He would go to your bed as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says Amphion to Antiope. And Sophocles plainly writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>His mother Zeus espoused, <br>Not in the likeness of gold, nor covered <br>With swan's plumage, as the Pleuronian girl <br>He impregnated; but an out and out man.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He further proceeds, and adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And quick the adulterer stood on the bridal steps.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he details still more plainly the licentiousness of the fabled Zeus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But he nor food nor cleansing water touched, <br>But heart-stung went to bed, and that whole night <br>Wantoned.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But let these be resigned to the follies of the theatre.</p>

<p>Heraclius plainly says: <q>But of the word which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> men are not able to understand, both before they have heard it, and on first hearing it.</q> And the lyrist Melanippides says in song:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Hear me, O Father, Wonder of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <br>Ruler of the ever-living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Parmenides the great, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says in the <em>Sophist</em>, writes of God thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Very much, since unborn and indestructible He is, <br>Whole, only-begotten, and immoveable, and unoriginated.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Hesiod also says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For He of the immortals all is King and Lord. <br>With God  none else in might may strive.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Nay more, Tragedy, drawing away from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, teaches to look up to heaven. Sophocles, as Hecat&aelig;us, who composed the histories in the work about <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the Egyptians, says, exclaims plainly on the stage:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>One in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, God is One, <br>Who made the heaven and the far-stretching earth,  <br>The Deep's blue billow, and the might of winds. <br>But of us mortals, many erring far <br>In heart, as solace for our woes, have raised <br>Images of gods&mdash; of stone, or else of brass, <br>Or figures wrought of gold or ivory; <br>And <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and vain festivals <br>To these appointing, deem ourselves devout.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Euripides on the stage, in tragedy, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Do you this lofty, boundless Ether see, <br>Which holds the earth around in the embrace <br>Of humid arms? This reckon Zeus, <br>And this regard as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in the drama of Pirithous, the same writes those lines in tragic vein:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>You, self-sprung, who on Ether's wheel <br>Has  universal nature spun, <br>Around whom Light and dusky spangled Night, <br>The countless host of stars, too, ceaseless dance.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For there he says that the creative mind is self-sprung. What follows applies to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, in which are the opposites of light and darkness.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus also, the son of Euphorion, says with very great <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of God:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Ether is Zeus, Zeus earth, and Zeus the heaven; <br>The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is Zeus, and all above.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>I am aware that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> assents to Heraclitus, who writes: <q>The one thing that is wise alone will not be expressed, and means the name of Zeus.</q> And again, <q>Law is to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of one.</q> And if you wish to adduce that saying, <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear,</q> you will find it expressed by the Ephesian  to the following effect: <q>Those that hear without understanding are like the deaf. The proverb witnesses against them, that when present they are absent.</q></p>

<p>But do you want to hear from the Greeks expressly of one first principle? Tim&aelig;us the Locrian, in the work on Nature, shall testify in the following words: <q>There is one first principle of all things unoriginated. For were it originated, it would be no longer the first principle; but the first principle would be that from which it originated.</q> For this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion was derived from what follows: <q>Hear,</q> it is said, <q>O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the Lord your God is one, and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023138"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> </p> <blockquote><p><q>Lo  He all sure and all unerring is,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says the Sibyl.</p>

<p>Homer also manifestly mentions the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> by a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> hit of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in the following words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If Outis,  alone as you are, offers you <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, <br>And there is no escaping disease sent by Zeus,&mdash; <br>For the Cyclopes heed not &AElig;gis-bearing Zeus.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And before him Orpheus said, speaking of the point in hand:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Son of great Zeus, Father of &AElig;gis-bearing Zeus.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian, who mentions the supreme Zeus and the inferior Zeus, leaves an indication of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Homer, while representing the gods as subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, appears to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Divine Being, whom <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> does not so revere. He says accordingly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Why, son of Peleus, mortal as you are, <br>With swift feet me pursuest, a god <br>Immortal? Have you not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <br>That I am a god?</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>For he shows that the Divinity cannot be captured by a mortal, or apprehended either with feet, or hands, or eyes, or by the body at all. <q>To whom have you likened the Lord? Or to what likeness have you likened Him?</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>.  Has not the artificer made the image? Or the goldsmith, melting the gold, has gilded it, and what follows.</p>

<p>The comic poet Epicharmus speaks in the <em>Republic</em> clearly of the Word in the following terms:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The life of men needs calculation and number alone, <br>And we live by number and calculation, for these save mortals.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>He then adds expressly:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Reason governs mortals, and alone preserves manners.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is in man reasoning; and there is a divine Reason.  <br>Reason is implanted in man to provide for life and sustenance, <br>But divine Reason attends the arts in the case of all, <br>Teaching them always what it is advantageous to do. <br>For it was not man that discovered art, but God brought it; <br>And the Reason of man derives its origin from the divine Reason.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The Spirit also cries by Isaiah: <q>Wherefore the multitude of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>? Says the Lord . I am full of <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> of rams, and the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls I wish not;</q> and a little after adds: <q>Wash you, and be clean. Put away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,</q>  and so forth.</p>

<p>Menander, the comic poet, writes in these very words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If one by offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, a crowd <br>Of bulls or kids, O Pamphilus, by Zeus. <br>Or such like things; by making works of art, <br>Garments of gold or purple, images  <br>Of ivory or emerald, deems by these <br>God can be made propitious, he does <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, <br>And has an empty mind. For the man must prove <br>A man of worth, who neither maids deflowers, <br>Nor an adulterer is, nor steals, nor kills <br>For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, O Pamphilus. <br>Nay, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> not a needle's thread. For God <br>You sees, being near beside you.</q> . . . </p></blockquote>

<p><q>I am a God at hand,</q> it is said by Jeremiah, <span class="stiki" id="note023148"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:23-24</a></span> <q>and not a God afar off. Shall a man do anything in secret places, and I shall not see him?</q></p>

<p>And again Menander, paraphrasing that Scripture, <q>Sacrifice a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, and trust in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q>  thus writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And not a needle even that is <br>Another's ever <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, dearest friend; <br>For God in righteous works delights, and so <br>Permits him to increase his worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, <br>Who toils, and ploughs the land both night and day. <br>But <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and righteous be, <br>Shining not in bright robes, but in your heart; <br>And when you hear the thunder, do not flee, <br>Being conscious to yourself of nought amiss, <br>Good sir, for you God ever present sees.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p><q>Whilst you are yet speaking,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>I will say, Lo, here I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023151"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;65:24</a></span> </p>

<p>Again Diphilus, the comic poet, discourses as, follows on the judgment:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Do you think, O Niceratus, that the dead, <br>Who in all kinds of luxury in life have shared, <br>Escape the Deity, as if forgot? <br>There is an eye of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which sees all. <br>For two ways, as we deem, to Hades lead&mdash; <br>One for the good, the other for the bad. <br>But if the earth hides both for ever, then <br>Go plunder, steal, rob, and be turbulent. <br>But <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> not. For in Hades judgment is, <br>Which God the Lord of all will execute, <br>Whose name too dreadful is for me to name, <br>Who gives to sinners length of earthly life. <br>If any mortal thinks, that day by day, <br>While doing ill, he eludes the gods' keen sight, <br>His thoughts are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and when <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has <br>The leisure, he shall then detected be <br>So thinking. Look, whoe'er you be that say <br>That there is not a God. There is, there is. <br>If one, by nature <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does, <br>Let him redeem the time; for such as he <br>Shall by and by due punishment receive.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And with this agrees the tragedy  in the following lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For there shall come, shall come  that point of time, <br>When Ether, golden-eyed, shall ope its store <br>Of treasured fire; and the devouring flame, <br>Raging, shall burn all things on earth below, <br>And all above.</q> ...</p></blockquote>

<p>And after a little he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p> <q>And when the whole world fades, <br>And vanished all the abyss of ocean's waves, <br>And earth of trees is bare; and wrapt in flames, <br>The air no more begets the winged tribes; <br>Then He who all destroyed, shall all restore.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>We shall find expressions similar to these also in the Orphic <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, written as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For having hidden all, brought them again <br>To gladsome light, forth from his sacred heart, <br>Solicitous.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And if we live throughout holily and righteously, we are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> here, and shall be happier after our departure hence; not possessing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for a time, but enabled to rest in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><q>At the same hearth and table as the rest <br>Of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods, we sit all free <br>Of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ills, unharmed,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> poetry of Empedocles. And so, according to the Greeks, none is so great as to be above judgment, none so insignificant as to escape its notice.</p>

<p>And the same Orpheus speaks thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But to the word divine, looking, attend, <br>Keeping aright the heart's receptacle <br>Of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and tread the straight path well, <br>And only to the world's <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> King <br>Direct your gaze.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And again, respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying that He was invisible, and that He was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to but one, a Chaldean by race&mdash; meaning either by this <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> or his son&mdash; he speaks as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But one a scion of Chaldean race; <br>For he the sun's path <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> right well, <br>And how the motion of the sphere about <br>The earth proceeds, in circle moving <br>Equally around its axis, how the winds <br>Their chariot guide o'er air and sea.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then, as if paraphrasing the expression, <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is my throne, and earth is my footstool,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023156"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But in great heaven, He is seated firm <br>Upon a throne of gold, and 'neath His feet <br>The earth. His right hand round the ocean's bound <br>He stretches; and the hills' foundations shake <br>To the centre at His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, nor can endure <br>His mighty strength. He all celestial is, <br>And all things finishes upon the earth. <br>He the Beginning, Middle is, and End. <br>But You I dare not speak. In limbs <br>And mind I tremble. He rules from on high.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And so forth. For in these he indicates these prophetic utterances: <q>If You open the heaven, trembling shall seize the mountains from Your presence; and they shall melt, as wax melts before the fire;</q>  and in Isaiah, Who has measured the heaven with a span, and the whole earth with His fist?  Again, when it is said:&mdash; </p>  <blockquote><p><q>Ruler of Ether, Hades, Sea, and Land, <br>Who with Your bolts Olympus' strong-built home <br>Dost shake. Whom <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> dread, and whom the throng <br>Of gods do <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Whom, too, the Fates <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, <br>Relentless though they be. O deathless One, <br>Our mother's Sire! Whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> makes all things reel; <br>Who mov'st the winds, and shroud'st in clouds the world, <br>Broad Ether cleaving with Your lightning gleams,&mdash; <br>Yours is the order 'mongst the stars, which run <br>As Your unchangeable behests direct. <br>Before Your burning throne the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> wait, <br>Much-working, charged to do all things, for men. <br>Your young Spring shines, all prank'd with purple flowers; <br>Your Winter with its chilling clouds assails; <br>Your Autumn noisy Bacchus distributes.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he adds, naming expressly the Almighty God:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Deathless Immortal, capable of being <br>To the immortals only uttered! Come, <br>Greatest of gods, with strong Necessity. <br>Dread, invincible, great, deathless One, <br>Whom Ether crowns.</q> ...</p></blockquote>

<p>By the expression <q>Sire of our Mother</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;</span>) he not only intimates creation out of nothing, but gives occasion to those who introduce emissions of imagining a consort of the Deity. And he paraphrases those prophetic Scripture&mdash; that in Isaiah, <q>I am He that fixes the thunder, and creates the wind; whose hands have founded the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023159"><a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse13">Amos&nbsp;4:13</a></span> and that in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>Behold, behold that I am He, and there is no god beside me: I will kill, and I will make to live; I will smite, and I will heal: and there is none that shall deliver out of my hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023160"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> </p> <blockquote><p><q>And He, from good, to mortals plants ill, <br>And cruel <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and tearful woes,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>according to Orpheus.</p>

<p>Such also are the words of the Parian Archilochus.</p> <blockquote><p><q>O Zeus, yours is the power of heaven, and you <br>Inflict on men things violent and wrong.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Again let the Thracian Orpheus sing to us:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>His right hand all around to ocean's bound <br>He stretches; and beneath His feet is earth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>These are plainly derived from the following: <q>The Lord will save the inhabited cities, and grasp the whole land in His hand like a nest;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023162"><a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;10:14</a></span> <q>It is the Lord that made the earth by His power,</q> as says Jeremiah, <q>and set up the earth by His wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023163"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:12</a></span> Further, in addition to these, Phocylides, who calls the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, explains in the following words that some of them are good, and others bad (for we also have learned that some are <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>):&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Demons there are&mdash; some here, some there&mdash; set over men; <br>Some, on man's entrance [into life], to ward off ill.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Rightly, then, also Philemon, the comic poet demolishes <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> in these words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Fortune is no divinity to us: <br>There's no such god. But what befalls by chance <br>And of itself to each, is Fortune called.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Sophocles the tragedian says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Not even the gods have all things as they choose, <br>Excepting Zeus; for he beginning is and end.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Orpheus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>One Might, the great, the flaming heaven, was <br>One Deity. All things one Being were; in whom <br>All these revolve fire, water, and the earth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>Pindar, the lyric poet, as if in Bacchic frenzy, plainly says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>What is God? The All.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who makes all mortals.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And when he says&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>How little, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, do you expect <br>Wisdom for man? 'Tis hard for mortal mind <br>The counsels of the gods to scan; and you <br>Were of a mortal mother born,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>he drew the thought from the following: <q>Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who was His counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023164"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;40:13</a></span> Hesiod, too, agrees with what is said above, in what he writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>No <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, sprung of men that dwell on earth, <br>Can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mind of &AElig;gis-bearing Zeus.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, then, Solon the Athenian, in the <em>Elegies</em>, following Hesiod, writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal's</a> mind to men is quite unknown.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, having prophesied that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would bring forth in trouble and pain, on account of transgression, a poet not undistinguished writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Never by day <br>From toil and woe shall they have rest, nor yet <br>By night from groans. Sad cares the gods to men <br>Shall give.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Further, when Homer says&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>The Sire himself the golden balance held,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>he intimates that God is just.</p>

<p>And Menander, the comic poet, in exhibiting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>To each man, on his birth, there is assigned <br>A tutelary Demon, as his life's good guide. <br>For that the Demon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, and harms <br>A good life, is not to be thought.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then he adds:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q><span class="greek">&#x1F0D;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03B4;&#x1FBF; &#x1F01;&#x03B3;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03B5;&#x1F31;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9; &#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>,</q></p></blockquote> 

<p>meaning either <q>that every one good is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> or, what is preferable, <q>that God in all things is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q></p>

<p>Again, &AElig;schylus the tragedian, setting forth the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not shrink from calling Him the Highest, in these words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Place <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> apart from mortals; and think not <br>That He is, like yourself, corporeal. <br>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not. Now He appears as fire, <br>Dread force; as water now; and now as gloom; <br>And in the beasts is dimly shadowed forth, <br>In wind, and cloud, in lightning, thunder, rain; <br>And minister to Him the seas and rocks, <br>Each fountain and the water's floods and streams. <br>The mountains tremble, and the earth, the vast <br>Abyss of sea, and towering height of hills, <br>When on them looks the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Sovereign's</a> awful eye: <br><a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Almighty</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High God</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Does he not seem to you to paraphrase that text, <q>At the presence of the Lord the earth trembles?</q>  In addition to these, the most prophetic Apollo is compelled&mdash; thus testifying to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God&mdash; to say of Athene, when the Medes made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Greece, that she besought and supplicated Zeus for Attica. The oracle is as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Pallas cannot Olympian Zeus propitiate, <br>Although with many words and sage advice she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>; <br>But he will give to the devouring fire many temples of the immortals, <br>Who now stand shaking with terror, and bathed in sweat;</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>and so forth.</p>

<p>Thearidas, in his book <em>On Nature</em>, writes: <q>There was then one really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beginning [first principle] of all that exist</q>&mdash; one. For that Being in the beginning is one and alone.</p> <blockquote><p><q>Nor is there any other except the Great King,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says Orpheus. In accordance with whom, the comic poet Diphilus says very sententiously,  the</p> <blockquote><p><q>Father of all, <br>To Him alone incessant reverence pay, <br>The inventor and the author of such blessings.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Rightly therefore <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <q>accustoms the best natures to attain to that study which formerly we said was the highest, both to see the good and to accomplish that ascent. And this, as appears, is not the throwing of the potsherds;  but the turning round of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from a nocturnal day to that which is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> return to that which really is, which we shall assert to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</q> Such as are partakers of this he judges  to belong to the golden race, when he says: <q>You are all brethren; and those who are of the golden race are most capable of judging most accurately in every respect.</q> </p>

<p>The Father, then, and Maker of all things is apprehended by all things, agreeably to all, by innate power and without teaching&mdash;things inanimate, sympathizing with the animate creation; and of living beings some are already immoral, working in the light of day. But of those that are still mortal, some are in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and carried still in their mother's womb; and others regulate themselves by their own independent reason. And of men all are Greeks and Barbarians. But no race anywhere of tillers of the soil, or nomads, and not even of dwellers in cities, can live, without being imbued with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a superior being.  Wherefore every eastern nation, and every nation touching the western shore; or the north, and each one towards the south, &mdash; all have one and the same preconception respecting Him who has appointed government; since the most universal of His operations equally pervade all. Much more did the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks, devoted to investigation, starting from the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, attribute <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>  to the <q>Invisible, and sole, and most powerful, and most skilful and supreme <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things most beautiful;</q>&mdash; not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the inferences from these truths, unless instructed by us, and not even how God is to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> naturally; but only, as we have already often said, by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> periphrasis.  Rightly therefore the apostle says, <q>Is He the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only, and not also of the Greeks?</q>&mdash; not only saying <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> that of the Greeks believing Greeks would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  but also intimating that in power the Lord is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Universal King. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither what He is, nor how He is Lord, and Father, and Maker, nor the rest of the system of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without being taught by it. Thus also the prophetic utterances have the same force as the apostolic word. For Isaiah says, <q>If you say, We trust in the Lord our God: now make an alliance with my Lord the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</q> And he adds: <q>And now, was it without the Lord that we came up to this land to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against it?</q>  And Jonah, himself a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, intimates the same thing in what he says: <q>And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, Why do you snore? Rise, call on your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may save us, and that we may not perish.</q>  For the expression <q>your God</q> he makes as if to one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him by way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and the expression, <q>that God may save us,</q> revealed the consciousness in the minds of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> who had applied their mind to the Ruler of all, but had not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And again the same: <q>And he said to them, I am the servant of the Lord; and I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven.</q> And again the same: <q>And he said, Let us by no means perish for the life of this man.</q> And Malachi the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> plainly exhibits God saying, <q>I will not accept <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> at your hands. For from the rising of the sun to its going down, My name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and in every place <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered to Me.</q>  And again: <q>Because I am a great King, says the Lord <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; and My name is manifest among the nations.</q> What name? The Son declaring the Father among the Greeks who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in what follows gives an exhibition of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: <q>Virtue owns not a master; and in proportion as each one honours or dishonours it, in that proportion he will be a partaker of it. The blame lies in the exercise of free choice.</q> But God is blameless. For He is never the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p><q>O warlike Trojans,</q> says the lyric poet, &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>High ruling Zeus, who beholds all things, <br>Is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of great woes to mortals; <br>But it is in the power of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to find <br>Justice, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, pure, <br>Companion of order, <br>And of wise Themis <br>The sons of the blessed are you <br>In finding her as your associate.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Pindar expressly introduces also Zeus Soter, the consort of Themis, proclaiming him King, Saviour, Just, in the following lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>First, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> Themis, of celestial birth, <br>On golden steeds, by Ocean's rock, <br>The Fates brought to the stair sublime, <br>The shining entrance of Olympus, <br>Of Saviour Zeus for aye  to be the spouse, <br>And she, the Hours, gold-diademed, fair-fruited, good, brought forth.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>He, then, who is not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and is puffed up with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teaching, is wretched and miserable, according to Euripides:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Who these things seeing, yet apprehends not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <br>But mouthing lofty themes, casts far <br>Perverse deceits; stubborn in which, the tongue <br>Its shafts discharges, about things unseen, <br>Devoid of sense.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Let him who wishes, then, approaching to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> instruction, learn from Parmenides the Eleatic, who promises:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Ethereal nature, then, and all the signs <br>In Ether you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the effects, <br>All viewless, of the sacred Sun's clear torch <br>And whence produced. The round-eyed Moon's <br>Revolving influences and nature you <br>Shall learn; and the ensphering heaven shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; <br>Whence sprung; and how Necessity took it <br>And chained so as to keep the starry bounds.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Metrodorus, though an Epicurean, spoke thus, divinely inspired: <q>Remember, O Menestratus, that, being a mortal endowed with a circumscribed life, you have in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ascended, till you have seen endless time, and the infinity of things; and what is to be, and what has been;</q> when with the blessed <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, we shall gaze on the blessed sight and vision; we following with Zeus, and others with other deities, if we may be permitted so to say, to receive initiation into the most blessed <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: which we shall celebrate, ourselves being perfect and untroubled by the ills which awaited us at the end of our time; and introduced to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of perfect and tranquil visions, and contemplating them in pure sunlight; we ourselves pure, and now no longer distinguished by that, which, when carrying it about, we call the body, being bound to it like an oyster to its shell.</p>

<p>The Pythagoreans call heaven the Antichthon [the opposite Earth]. And in this land, it is said by Jeremiah, <q>I will place you among the children, and give you the chosen land as inheritance of God Omnipotent;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023184"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:19</a></span> and they who inherit it shall reign over the earth. Myriads on myriads of examples  rush on my mind which might adduce. But for the sake of symmetry the discourse must now stop, in order that we may not exemplify the saying of Agatho the tragedian:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Treating our by-work as work, <br>And doing our work as by-work.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>It having been, then, as I think, clearly shown in what way it is to be understood that the Greeks were called thieves by the Lord, I willingly leave the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For were we to go over their sayings, we should gather together directly such a quantity of notes, in showing that the whole of the Hellenic wisdom was derived from the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But this speculation, we shall, nevertheless, again touch on, as necessity requires, when we collect the opinions current among the Greeks respecting first principles.</p>

<p>But from what has been said, it tacitly devolves on us to consider in what way the Hellenic books are to be perused by the man who is able to pass through the billows in them. Therefore</p> <blockquote><p><q>Happy is he who possesses the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>as appears according to Empedocles,</p> <blockquote><p><q>But wretched he, who cares for dark opinion about the Gods.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He divinely showed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to be the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and misery. <q>For it behooves <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to be acquainted with very many things,</q> according to Heraclitus; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> must</p> <blockquote><p><q>He, who seeks to be good, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in many things.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>It is then now clear to us, from what has been said, that the beneficence of God is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and that, from an unbeginning principle, equal natural righteousness reached all, according to the worth of each several race&mdash;never having had a beginning. For God did not make a beginning of being Lord and Good, being always what He is. Nor will He ever cease to do good, although He bring all things to an end. And each one of us is a partaker of His beneficence, as far as He wills. For the difference of the elect is made by the intervention of a choice worthy of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by exercise.</p>

<p>Thus, then, let our fifth Miscellany of gnostic notes in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> be brought to a close.</p>
