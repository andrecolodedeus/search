<h1>The Stromata (Book VI)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Plan. </h2>

<p>The sixth and also the seventh Miscellany of gnostic notes, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, having delineated as well as possible the ethical argument conveyed in them, and having exhibited what the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is in his life, proceed to show the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that he is by no means impious, as they suppose, but that he alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, by a compendious exhibition of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic's</a> form of religion, as far as it is possible, without danger, to commit it to writing in a book of reference. For the Lord enjoined <q>to labour for the meat which endures to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023194"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Blessed is he that sows into all waters, whose ox and ass tread,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023195"><a href="../bible/isa032.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;32:20</a></span> [that is,] the people, from the Law and from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, gathered into one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p><q>Now the weak eats herbs,</q> according to the noble apostle. <span class="stiki" id="note023196"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;14:2</a></span> <em>The Instructor</em>, divided by us into three books, has already exhibited the training and nurture up from the state of childhood, that is, the course of life which from elementary instruction grows by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and in the case of those enrolled in the number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, prepares beforehand the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, endued with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for the reception of gnostic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The Greeks, then, clearly learning, from what shall be said by us in these pages, that in profanely <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the God-loving man, they themselves act impiously; then, as the notes advance, in accordance with the style of the <em>Miscellanies</em>, we must solve the difficulties raised both by Greeks and Barbarians with respect to the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>In a meadow the flowers blooming variously, and in a park the plantations of fruit trees, are not separated according to their species from those of other kinds. If some, culling varieties, have composed learned collections, Meadows, and Helicons, and Honeycombs, and Robes; then, with the things which come to recollection by haphazard, and are expurgated neither in order nor expression, but purposely scattered, the form of the <em>Miscellanies </em>is promiscuously variegated like a meadow. And such being the case, my notes shall serve as kindling sparks; and in the case of him, who is fit for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if he chance to fall in with them, research made with exertion will turn out to his benefit and advantage. For it is right that labour should precede not only food but also, much more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in the case of those that are advancing to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the <q>strait and narrow way,</q> which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Lord's.</p>

<p>Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and our spiritual garden, is the Saviour Himself; into whom we are planted, being transferred and transplanted, from our old life, into the good land. And transplanting contributes to fruitfulness. The Lord, then, into whom we have been transplanted, is the Light and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Knowledge.</p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is otherwise spoken of in a twofold sense: that, commonly so called, which appears in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (similarly also comprehension and apprehension), universally, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of individual objects; in which not only the rational powers, but equally the irrational, share, which I would never term <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, inasmuch as the apprehension of things through the senses comes naturally. But that which <em>par excellence</em> is termed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, bears the impress of judgment and reason, in the exercise of which there will be rational cognitions alone, applying purely to objects of thought, and resulting from the bare energy of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man,</q> says David,  <q>who pities</q> (those ruined through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>), <q>and lends</q> (from the communication of the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) not at haphazard, for <q>he will dispense his words in judgment:</q> with profound calculation, <q>he has dispersed, he has given to the poor.</q></p> 

<h2>Chapter 2. The Subject of Plagiarisms Resumed. The Greeks Plagiarized from One Another</h2>

<p>Before handling the point proposed, we must, by way of preface, add to the close of the fifth book what is wanting. For since we have shown that the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> style was ancient, and was employed not only by our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but also by the majority of the ancient Greeks, and by not a few of the rest of the Gentile Barbarians, it was requisite to proceed to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the initiated. I postpone the elucidation of these till we advance to the confutation of what is said by the Greeks on first principles; for we shall show that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> belong to the same branch of speculation. And having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the declaration of Hellenic thought is illuminated all round by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, bestowed on us in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, taking it according to the sense, we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, not to say what is invidious, that the theft of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> passed to them.</p>

<p>Come, and let us adduce the Greeks as witnesses against themselves to the theft. For, inasmuch as they pilfer from one another, they establish the fact that they are thieves; and although against their will, they are detected, clandestinely appropriating to those of their own race the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which belongs to us. For if they do not keep their hands from each other, they will hardly do it from our authors. I shall say nothing of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, since the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are the authors of the divisions into <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, confess in writing, so as not to be convicted of ingratitude, that they have received from Socrates the most important of their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. But after availing myself of a few testimonies of men most talked of, and of repute among the Greeks, and exposing their plagiarizing style, and selecting them from various periods, I shall turn to what follows.</p>

<p>Orpheus, then, having composed the line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Since nothing else is more shameless and wretched than <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Homer plainly says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Since nothing else is more dreadful and shameless than a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And Mus&aelig;us having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Since art is greatly superior to strength,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Homer says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>By art rather than strength is the woodcutter greatly superior.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Mus&aelig;us having composed the lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And as the fruitful field produces leaves, <br>And on the ash trees some fade, others grow, <br>So whirls the race of man its leaf,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Homer transcribes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Some of the leaves the wind scatters on the ground. <br>The budding wood bears some; in time of spring, <br>They come. So springs one race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and one departs.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Homer having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> to exult over dead men,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Archilochus and Cratinus write, the former:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is not noble at dead men to sneer;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and Cratinus in the <em>Lacones:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For men 'tis dreadful to exult <br>Much o'er the stalwart dead.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Archilochus, transferring that Homeric line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I erred, nor say I nay: instead of many</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>writes thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I erred, and this mischief has somehow seized another.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>As certainly also that line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Even-handed  <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the slayer slays.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>He also, altering, has given forth thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I will do it. <br>For Mars to men in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is evenhanded.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Also, translating the following:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The issues of victory among men depend on the gods,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>he openly encourages youth, in the following iambic:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Victory's issues on the gods depend.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Homer having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>With feet unwashed sleeping on the ground,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes in <em>Erechtheus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Upon the plain spread with no couch they sleep, <br>Nor in the streams of water lave their feet.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Archilochus having likewise said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But one with this and one with that <br>His heart delights,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>in correspondence with the Homeric line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For one in these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, one in those delights,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides says in <em>&OElig;neus:</em>&mdash; </p>  <blockquote><p><q>But one in these ways, one in those, has more delight.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And I have heard &AElig;schylus saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>He who is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> ought to stay at home; <br>There should he also stay, who speeds not well.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Euripides, too, shouting the like on the stage:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Happy the man who, prosperous, stays at home.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Menander, too, on comedy, saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>He ought at home to stay, and free remain, <br>Or be no longer rightly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Theognis having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The exile has no comrade dear and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides has written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Far from the poor flies every friend.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Epicharmus, saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Daughter, woe worth the day! <br>You who are old I marry to a youth;</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>and adding:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For the young husband takes some other girl, <br>And for another husband longs the wife,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides  writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>'Tis bad to yoke an old wife to a youth; <br>For he desires to share another's bed, <br>And she, by him deserted, mischief plots.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides having, besides, said in the <em>Medea:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For no good do a bad man's gifts,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sophocles in <em>Ajax Flagellifer</em> utters this iambic:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For foes' gifts are no gifts, nor any boon.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Solon having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For surfeit insolence begets, <br>When store of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> attends.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Theognis writes in the same way:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For surfeit insolence begets, <br>When store of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> attends the bad.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Whence also Thucydides, in the <em>Histories</em>, says: <q>Many men, to whom in a great degree, and in a short time, unlooked-for prosperity comes, are wont to turn to insolence.</q> And Philistus  likewise imitates the same sentiment, expressing himself thus: <q>And the many things which turn out prosperously to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in accordance with reason, have an incredibly dangerous  tendency to misfortune. For those who meet with unlooked success beyond their expectations, are for the most part wont to turn to insolence.</q> Again, Euripides having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For children sprung of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who have led <br>A hard and toilsome life, superior are;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Critias writes: <q>For I begin with a man's origin: how far the best and strongest in body will he be, if his father exercises himself, and eats in a hardy way, and subjects his body to toilsome labour; and if the mother of the future child be strong in body, and give herself exercise.</q></p>

<p>Again, Homer having said of the Heph&aelig;stus-made shield:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Upon it earth and heaven and sea he made, <br>And Ocean's rivers' mighty strength portrayed,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Pherecydes of Syros says:&mdash; <q>Zas makes a cloak large and beautiful, and works on it earth and Ogenus, and the palace of Ogenus.</q></p>

<p>And Homer having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Shame, which greatly hurts a man or helps,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes in <em>Erechtheus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Of shame I find it hard to judge; <br>'Tis needed. 'Tis at times a great mischief.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Take, by way of parallel, such plagiarisms as the following, from those who flourished together, and were rivals of each other. From the <em>Orestes</em> of Euripides:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Dear charm of sleep, aid in disease.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>From the <em>Eriphyle</em> of Sophocles:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Hie you to sleep, healer of that disease.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And from the <em>Antigone</em> of Sophocles:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Bastardy is opprobrious in name; but the nature is equal;</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And from the <em>Aleuades</em> of Sophocles:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Each good thing has its nature equal.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, in the <em>Ctimenus</em>  of Euripides:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For him who toils, God helps;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in the <em>Minos</em> of Sophocles;</p> <blockquote><p><q>To those who act not, fortune is no ally;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And from the <em>Alexander</em> of Euripides:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But time will show; and learning, by that test, <br>I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you are good or bad;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And from the <em>Hipponos</em> of Sophocles:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Besides, conceal nothing; since Time, <br>That sees all, hears all, all things will unfold.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But let us similarly run over the following; for Eumelus having composed the line,</p> <blockquote><p><q>Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the daughters nine,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Solon thus begins the elegy:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the children bright.</q></p></blockquote> 

<p>Again, Euripides, paraphrasing the Homeric line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>What, whence are you? Your city and your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, where?</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>employs the following iambics in <em>&AElig;geus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>What country shall we say that you have left <br>To roam in exile, what your land&mdash; the bound <br>Of your own native soil? Who you begot? <br>And of what father do you call yourself the son?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And what? Theognis  having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Wine largely drunk is bad; but if one use <br>It with discretion, 'tis not bad, but good,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>does not Panyasis write?</p> <blockquote><p><q>Above the gods' best gift to men ranks wine, <br>In measure drunk; but in excess the worst.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Hesiod, too, saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But for the fire to you I'll give a plague,  <br>For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to delight themselves withal,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And for the fire <br>Another fire greater and unconquerable, <br>Sprung up in the shape of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And in addition, Homer, saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is no satiating the greedy paunch, <br>Baneful, which many plagues has caused to men.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Dire need and baneful paunch me overcome; <br>From which all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides, Callias the comic poet having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>With madmen, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> must be mad, they say,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Menander, in the <em>Poloumenoi</em>, expresses himself similarly, saying:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The presence of wisdom is not always suitable: <br>One sometimes must with others play  the fool.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Antimachus of Teos having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>From gifts, to mortals many ills arise,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Augias composed the line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For gifts men's mind and acts deceive.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Hesiod having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Than a good wife, no man a better thing <br>Ere gained; than a bad wife, a worse,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Simonides said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>A better prize than a good wife no man <br>Ere gained, than a bad one nought worse.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Epicharmas having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>As destined long to live, and yet not long, <br>Think of yourself.</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Why? Seeing the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> we have uncertain is, <br>Why don't we live as free from care, as pleasant <br>As we may?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly also, the comic poet Diphilus having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The life of men is prone to change,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Posidippus says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>No man of mortal mould his life has passed <br>From suffering free. Nor to the end again <br>Has continued prosperous.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly  speaks to you <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, writing of man as a creature subject to change. Again, Euripides having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Oh life to mortal men of trouble full, <br>How slippery in everything are you! <br>Now you grow, and now you decay away. <br>And there is set no limit, no, not one, <br>For mortals of their course to make an end, <br>Except when Death's remorseless final end <br>Comes, sent from Zeus,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Diphilus writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is no life which has not its own ills, <br>Pains, cares, thefts, and anxieties, disease; <br>And Death, as a physician, coming, gives <br>Rest to their victims in his quiet sleep.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, Euripides having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Many are fortune's shapes, <br>And many things contrary to expectation the gods perform,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>The tragic poet Theodectes similarly writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The instability of mortals' fates.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Bacchylides having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>To few  alone of mortals is it given <br>To reach hoary age, being prosperous all the while, <br>And not meet with calamities,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Moschion, the comic poet, writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But he of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is most blest, <br>Who leads throughout an equal life.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And you will find that, Theognis having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For no advantage to a man grown old <br>A young wife is, who will not, as a ship <br>The helm, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Aristophanes, the comic poet, writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>An old man to a young wife suits but ill.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For Anacreon, having written:&mdash; </p>  <blockquote><p>Luxurious <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I sing, <br>With flowery garlands graced, <br>He is of gods the king, <br>He mortal men subdues,&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not only men attacks, <br>And <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but disturbs <br>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of gods above, and to the sea <br>Descends.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But not to protract the discourse further, in our anxiety to show the propensity of the Greeks to plagiarism in expressions and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, allow us to adduce the express testimony of Hippias, the sophist of Elea, who discourses on the point in hand, and speaks thus: <q>Of these things some perchance are said by Orpheus, some briefly by Mus&aelig;us; some in one place, others in other places; some by Hesiod, some by Homer, some by the rest of the poets; and some in prose compositions, some by Greeks, some by Barbarians. And I from all these, placing together the things of most importance and of kindred character, will make the present discourse new and varied.</q></p>

<p>And in order that we may see that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and history, and even rhetoric, are not free of a like reproach, it is right to adduce a few instances from them. For Alcm&aelig;on of Crotona having said, <q>It is easier to guard against a man who is an enemy than a friend,</q> Sophocles wrote in the <em>Antigone:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For what sore more grievous than a bad friend?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Xenophon said: <q>No man can injure enemies in any way other than by appearing to be a friend.</q></p>

<p>And Euripides having said in <em>Telephus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Shall we Greeks be slaves to Barbarians?</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Thrasymachus, in the oration for the <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Lariss&aelig;ans</a>, says: <q>Shall we be slaves to Archelaus&mdash; Greeks to a Barbarian?</q></p>

<p>And Orpheus having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Water is the change for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and death for water; <br>From water is earth, and what comes from earth is again water, <br>And from that, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which changes the whole ether;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and Heraclitus, putting together the expressions from these lines, writes thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>It is death for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to become water, and death for <br>water to become earth; and from earth comes water, <br>and from water <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Athamas the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> having said, <q>Thus was produced the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and there are four roots&mdash; fire, water, air, earth: for from these is the origination of what is produced,</q>&mdash; Empedocles of Agrigentum wrote:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The four roots of all things first do you hear&mdash; <br>Fire, water, earth, and ether's boundless height: <br>For of these all that was, is, shall be, comes.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> having said, <q>Wherefore also the gods, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> men, release sooner from life those they value most,</q> Menander wrote:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Whom the gods <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, dies young.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Euripides having written in the <em>&OElig;nomaus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>We judge of things obscure from what we see;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and in the <em>Ph&oelig;nix:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>By signs the obscure is fairly grasped,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Hyperides says, <q>But we must investigate things unseen by learning from signs and probabilities.</q> And Isocrates having said, <q>We must conjecture the future by the past,</q> Andocides does not shrink from saying, <q>For we must make use of what has happened previously as signs in reference to what is to be.</q> Besides, Theognis having said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of counterfeit silver and gold is not intolerable, <br>O Cyrnus, and to a wise man is not difficult of detection; <br>But if the mind of a friend is hidden in his breast, <br>If he is false,  and has a treacherous heart within, <br>This is the basest thing for mortals, caused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <br>And of all things the hardest to detect,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Oh Zeus, why have you given to men clear tests <br>Of spurious gold, while on the body grows <br>No mark sufficing to discover clear <br>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Hyperides himself also says, <q>There is no feature of the mind impressed on the countenance of men.</q></p>

<p>Again, Stasinus having composed the line:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Fool, who, having slain the father, leaves the children,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Xenophon  says, <q>For I seem to myself to have acted in like manner, as if one who killed the father should spare his children.</q> And Sophocles having written in the <em>Antigone:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Mother and father being in Hades now, <br>No brother ever can to me spring forth,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Herodotus says, <q>Mother and father being no more, I shall not have another brother.</q> In addition to these, Theopompus having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Twice children are old men in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And before him Sophocles in <em>Peleus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Peleus, the son of &AElig;acus, I, sole housekeeper, <br>Guide, old as he is now, and train again, <br>For the aged man is once again a child,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Antipho the orator says, <q>For the nursing of the old is like the nursing of children.</q> Also the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, <q>The old man then, as seems, will be twice a child.</q> Further, Thucydides having said, <q>We alone bore the brunt at Marathon,</q> &mdash; Demosthenes said, <q>By those who bore the brunt at Marathon.</q> Nor will I omit the following. Cratinus having said in the <em>Pytine:</em> &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The preparation perchance you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Andocides the orator says, <q>The preparation, gentlemen of the jury, and the eagerness of our enemies, almost all of you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> Similarly also Nicias, in the speech on the deposit, against Lysias, says, <q>The preparation and the eagerness of the adversaries, you see, O gentlemen of the jury.</q> After him &AElig;schines says, <q>You see the preparation, O men of Athens, and the line of battle.</q> Again, Demosthenes having said, <q>What <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and what canvassing, O men of Athens, have been employed in this contest, I think almost all of you are aware;</q> and Philinus similarly, <q>What <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, what forming of the line of battle, gentlemen of the jury, have taken place in this contest, I think not one of you is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</q> Isocrates, again, having said, <q>As if she were related to his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, not him,</q> Lysias says in the <em>Orphics</em>, <q>And he was plainly related not to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but to the money.</q> Since Homer also having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O friend, if in this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, by taking flight, <br>We should from age and death exemption win, <br>I would not fight among the first myself, <br>Nor would I send you to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fray; <br>But now&mdash; for myriad fates of death attend <br>In any case, which man may not escape <br>Or shun&mdash; come on. To some one we shall bring <br>Renown, or some one shall to us,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Theopompus writes, <q>For if, by avoiding the present danger, we were to pass the rest of our time in security, to show <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life would not be wonderful. But now, so many fatalities are incident to life, that death in battle seems preferable.</q> And what? Child the sophist having uttered the apophthegm, <q>Become surety, and mischief is at hand,</q> did not Epicharmus utter the same sentiment in other terms, when he said, <q>Suretyship is the daughter of mischief, and loss that of suretyship?</q>  Further, Hippocrates the physician having written, <q>You must look to time, and locality, and age, and disease,</q> Euripides says in <em>Hexameters:</em> &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Those who the healing art would practice well, <br>Must study people's modes of life, and note <br>The soil, and the diseases so consider.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Homer again, having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I say no mortal man can doom escape,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Archinus says, <q>All men are bound to die either sooner or later;</q> and Demosthenes, <q>To all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> death is the end of life, though one should keep himself shut up in a coop.</q></p>

<p>And Herodotus, again, having said, in his discourse about Glaucus the Spartan, that the Pythian said, <q>In the case of the Deity, to say and to do are equivalent,</q> Aristophanes said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For to think and to do are equivalent.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And before him, Parmenides of Elea said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For thinking and being are the same.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> having said, <q>And we shall show, not absurdly perhaps, that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is sight; and hope diminishes the passion, memory nourishes it, and intercourse preserves it;</q> does not Philemon the comic poet write:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>First all see, then admire; <br>Then gaze, then come to hope; <br>And thus arises <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Further, Demosthenes having said, <q>For to all of us death is a debt,</q> and so forth, Phanocles writes in <em>Loves</em>, or <em>The Beautiful:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But from the Fates' unbroken thread escape <br>Is none for those that feed on earth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>You will also find that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> having said, <q>For the first sprout of each plant, having got a fair start, according to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of its own nature, is most powerful in inducing the appropriate end;</q> the historian writes, <q>Further, it is not natural for one of the wild plants to become cultivated, after they have passed the earlier period of growth;</q> and the following of Empedocles:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For I already have been boy and girl, <br>And bush, and bird, and mute fish in the sea,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides transcribes in <em>Chrysippus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But nothing dies <br>Of things that are; but being dissolved, <br>One from the other, <br>Shows another form.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> having said, in the <em>Republic</em>, that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were common, Euripides writes in the <em>Protesilaus:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For common, then, is <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> bed.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Further, Euripides having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For to the temperate enough sufficient is</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> expressly says, <q>Sufficiency is the greatest riches of all.</q></p>

<p>Again, Aristophanes having written:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Life you securely shall enjoy, being just <br>And free from turmoil, and from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> live well,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> says, <q>The greatest fruit of righteousness is tranquillity.</q></p> 

<p>Let these species, then, of Greek plagiarism of sentiments, being such, stand as sufficient for a clear specimen to him who is capable of perceiving.</p>

<p>And not only have they been detected pirating and paraphrasing thoughts and expressions, as will be shown; but they will also be convicted of the possession of what is entirely stolen. For stealing entirely what is the production of others, they have published it as their own; as Eugamon of Cyrene did the entire book on the Thesprotians from Mus&aelig;us, and Pisander of Camirus the Heraclea of Pisinus of Lindus, and Panyasis of Halicarnassus, the capture of &OElig;chalia from Cleophilus of Samos.</p>

<p>You will also find that Homer, the great poet, took from Orpheus, from the <em>Disappearance </em>of Dionysus, those words and what follows verbatim:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>As a man trains a luxuriant shoot of olive.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And in the <em>Theogony</em>, it is said by Orpheus of Kronos:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>He lay, his thick neck bent aside; and him <br>All-conquering Sleep had seized.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>These Homer transferrred to the Cyclops.  And Hesiod writes of Melampous:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Gladly to hear, what the immortals have assigned <br>To men, the brave from cowards clearly marks;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and so forth, taking it word for word from the poet Mus&aelig;us.</p>

<p>And Aristophanes the comic poet has, in the first of the <em>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</em>, transferred the words from the <em>Empiprameni </em>of Cratinus. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the comic poet, and Aristophanes in <em>D&aelig;dalus</em>, steal from one another. <em>Cocalus</em>, composed by Araros,  the son of Aristophanes, was by the comic poet Philemon altered, and made into the comedy called <em>Hypobolim&oelig;ns</em>.</p>

<p>Eumelus and Acusilaus the historiographers changed the contents of Hesiod into prose, and published them as their own. Gorgias of Leontium and Eudemus of Naxus, the historians, stole from Melesagoras. And, besides, there is Bion of Proconnesus, who epitomized and transcribed the writings of the ancient Cadmus, and Archilochus, and Aristotle, and Leandrus, and Hellanicus, and Hecat&aelig;us, and Androtion, and Philochorus. Dieuchidas of Megara transferred the beginning of his treatise from the <em>Deucalion</em> of Hellanicus. I pass over in silence Heraclitus of Ephesus, who took a very great deal from Orpheus.</p>

<p>From Pythagoras <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> derived the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and he from the Egyptians. And many of the Platonists composed books, in which they show that the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, as we said in the beginning, and Aristotle, took the most and principal of their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> also pilfered his leading <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from Democritus. Let these things then be so. For life would fail me, were I to undertake to go over the subject in detail, to expose the selfish plagiarism of the Greeks, and how they claim the discovery of the best of their doctrines, which they have received from us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Plagiarism by the Greeks of the Miracles Related in the Sacred Books of the Hebrews</h2>

<p>And now they are convicted not only of borrowing doctrines from the Barbarians, but also of relating as prodigies of Hellenic mythology the marvels found in our records, wrought through divine power from above, by those who led <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lives, while devoting attention to us. And we shall ask at them whether those things which they relate are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false. But they will not say that they are false; for they will not with their will condemn themselves of the very great silliness of composing falsehoods, but of necessity admit them to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And how will the prodigies enacted by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> any longer appear to them incredible? For the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His care for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, turns some to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by commands, some by threats, some by miraculous signs, some by gentle promises.</p>

<p>Well, the Greeks, when once a drought had wasted Greece for a protracted period, and a dearth of the fruits of the earth ensued, it is said, those that survived of them, having, because of the famine, come as suppliants to Delphi, asked the Pythian priestess how they should be released from the calamity. She announced that the only help in their distress was, that they should avail themselves of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of &AElig;acus. Prevailed on by them, &AElig;acus, ascending the Hellenic hill, and stretching out pure  hands to heaven, and invoking the common  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besought him to pity wasted Greece. And as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, thunder sounded, out of the usual course of things, and the whole surrounding atmosphere was covered with clouds. And impetuous and continued rains, bursting down, filled the whole region. The result was a copious and rich fertility wrought by the husbandry of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of &AElig;acus.</p>

<p><q>And Samuel called on the Lord,</q> it is said, <q>and the Lord gave forth His voice, and rain in the day of harvest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023239"><a href="../bible/1sa011.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;11:18</a></span> Do you see that <q>He who sends His rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note023240"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> by the subject powers is the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>? And the whole of our Scripture is full of instances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in reference to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the just, hearing and performing each one of their petitions.</p>

<p>Again, the Greeks relate, that in the case of a failure once of the Etesian winds, Arist&aelig;us once <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in Ceus to Isthmian Zeus. For there was great devastation, everything being burnt up with the heat in consequence of the winds which had been wont to refresh the productions of the earth, not blowing, and he easily called them back.</p>

<p>And at Delphi, on the expedition of Xerxes against Greece, the Pythian priestess having made answer:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O Delphians, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the winds, and it will be better,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>they having erected an altar and performed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the winds, had them as their helpers. For, blowing violently around Cape Sepias, they shivered the whole preparations of the Persian expedition. Empedocles of Agrigentum was called <q>Checker of Winds.</q> Accordingly it is said, that when, on a time, a wind blew from the mountain of Agrigentum, heavy and pestiferous for the inhabitants, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also of barrenness to their wives, he made the wind to cease. Wherefore he himself writes in the lines:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>You shall the might of the unwearied winds make still, <br>Which rushing to the earth spoil mortals' crops, <br>And at your will bring back the avenging blasts.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And they say that he was followed by some that used divinations, and some that had been long vexed by sore diseases.  They plainly, then, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the performance of cures, and signs and wonders, from our Scriptures. For if certain powers move the winds and dispense showers, let them hear the psalmist: <q>How amiable are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</q>  This is the Lord of powers, and principalities, and authorities, of whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaks; so that we may be with Him. <q>And you shall circumcise your hard heart, and shall not harden your neck any more. For He is Lord of lords and God of gods, the great God and strong,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023243"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:16-17</a></span> unit so forth. And Isaiah says, <q>Lift your eyes to the height, and see who has produced all these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023244"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse26">Isaiah&nbsp;40:26</a></span> </p>

<p>And some say that plagues, and hail-storms, and tempests, and the like, are wont to take place, not alone in consequence of material disturbance, but also through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For instance, they say that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> at Cleone, watching the phenomena of the skies, when the clouds are about to discharge hail, avert the threatening of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> by incantations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. And if at any time there is the want of an animal, they are satisfied with bleeding their own finger for a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. The prophetess Diotima, by the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> previous to the pestilence, effected a delay of the plague for ten years. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, too, of Epimenides of Crete, put off the Persian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for an equal period. And it is considered to be all the same whether we call these spirits gods or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And those skilled in the matter of consecrating <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, in many of the temples have erected tombs of the dead, calling the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of these D&aelig;mons, and teaching them to be worshipped by men; as having, in consequence of the purity of their life, by the divine foreknowledge, received the power of wandering about the space around the earth in order to minister to men. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were by nature kept in the body. But of these, as the work proceeds, in the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, we shall discourse.</p>

<p>Democritus, who predicted many things from observation of celestial phenomena, was called <q>Wisdom</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03A3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>). On his meeting a cordial reception from his brother Damasus, he predicted that there would be much rain, judging from certain stars. Some, accordingly, convinced by him, gathered their crops; for being in summer-time, they were still on the threshing-floor. But others lost all, unexpected and heavy showers having burst down.</p>

<p>How then shall the Greeks any longer disbelieve the divine appearance on Mount Sinai, when the fire burned, consuming none of the things that grew on the mount; and the sound of trumpets issued forth, breathed without instruments? For that which is called the descent on the mount of God is the advent of divine power, pervading the whole world, and proclaiming <q>the light that is inaccessible.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023245"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> </p>

<p>For such is the allegory, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. But the fire was seen, as Aristobulus  says, while the whole multitude, amounting to not less than a million, besides those under age, were congregated around the mountain, the circuit of the mount not being less than five days' journey. Over the whole place of the vision the burning fire was seen by them all encamped as it were around; so that the descent was not local. For God is everywhere.</p>

<p>Now the compilers of narratives say that in the island of Britain  there is a cave situated under a mountain, and a chasm on its summit; and that, accordingly, when the wind falls into the cave, and rushes into the bosom of the cleft, a sound is heard like cymbals clashing musically. And often in the woods, when the leaves are moved by a sudden gust of wind, a sound is emitted like the song of birds.</p>

<p>Those also who composed the <em>Persics</em> relate that in the uplands, in the country of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, three mountains are situated on an extended plain, and that those who travel through the locality, on coming to the first mountain, hear a confused sound as of several myriads shouting, as if in battle array; and on reaching the middle one, they hear a clamour louder and more distinct; and at the end hear people singing a p&aelig;an, as if victorious. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in my opinion, of the whole sound, is the smoothness and cavernous character of the localities; and the air, entering in, being sent back and going to the same point, sounds with considerable force. Let these things be so. But it is possible for God Almighty,  even without a medium, to produce a voice and vision through the ear, showing that His greatness has a natural order beyond what is customary, in order to the conversion of the hitherto unbelieving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the reception of the commandment given. But there being a cloud and a lofty mountain, how is it not possible to hear a different sound, the wind moving by the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>You heard the voice of words, and saw no similitude.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023249"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:12</a></span> You see how the Lord's voice, the Word, without shape, the power of the Word, the luminous word of the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from heaven, from above, coming to the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wrought by the luminous immediate ministry.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Greeks Drew Many of Their Philosophical Tenets from the Egyptian and Indian Gymnosophists</h2>

<p>We shall find another testimony in confirmation, in the fact that the best of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, having appropriated their most excellent <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from us, boast, as it were, of certain of the tenets which pertain to each <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> being culled from other Barbarians, chiefly from the Egyptians&mdash; both other tenets, and that especially of the transmigration of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the Egyptians pursue a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of their own. This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer,  with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth. Of these, one is about the order of the fixed stars that are visible, and another about the conjunctions and luminous appearances of the sun and moon; and the rest respecting their risings. Next in order advances the sacred Scribe, with wings on his head, and in his hand a book and rule, in which were writing ink and the reed, with which they write. And he must be acquainted with what are called hieroglyphics, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about cosmography and geography, the position of the sun and moon, and about the five planets; also the description of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the chart of the Nile; and the description of the equipment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and of the places <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to them, and about the measures and the things in use in the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. Then the Stole-keeper follows those previously mentioned, with the cubit of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the cup for libations. He is acquainted with all points called P&aelig;deutic (relating to training) and Moschophatic (sacrificial). There are also ten books which relate to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid by them to their gods, and containing the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> worship; as that relating to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, processions, festivals, and the like. And behind all walks the Prophet, with the water-vase carried openly in his arms; who is followed by those who carry the issue of loaves. He, as being the governor of the temple, learns the ten books called <q>Hieratic;</q> and they contain all about the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and the gods, and the whole of the training of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For the Prophet is, among the Egyptians, also over the distribution of the revenues. There are then forty-two books of Hermes indispensably necessary; of which the six-and-thirty containing the whole <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Egyptians are learned by the forementioned personages; and the other six, which are medical, by the Pastophoroi (image-bearers),&mdash; treating of the structure of the body, and of diseases, and instruments, and medicines, and about the eyes, and the last about <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.  Such are the customs of the Egyptians, to speak briefly.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Indians, too, has been celebrated. Alexander of Macedon, having taken ten of the Indian Gymnosophists, that seemed the best and most sententious, proposed to them problems, threatening to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> him that did not answer to the purpose; ordering one, who was the eldest of them, to decide.</p>

<p>The first, then, being asked whether he thought that the living were more in number than the dead, said, The living; for that the dead were not. The second, on being asked whether the sea or the land maintained larger beasts, said, The land; for the sea was part of it. And the third being asked which was the most cunning of animals? The one, which has not hitherto been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, man. And the fourth being interrogated, For what reason they had made Sabba, who was their prince, revolt, answered, Because they wished him to live well rather than die ill. And the fifth being asked, Whether he thought that day or night was first, said, One day. For puzzling questions must have puzzling answers. And the sixth being posed with the query, How shall one be loved most? By being most powerful; in order that he may not be timid. And the seventh being asked, How any one of men could become God? Said, If he do what it is impossible for man to do. And the eighth being asked, Which is the stronger, life or death? Said, Life, which bears such ills. And the ninth being interrogated, Up to what point it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man to live? Said, Till he does not think that to die is better than to live. And on Alexander ordering the tenth to say something, for he was judge, he said, <q>One spoke worse than another.</q> And on Alexander saying, Shall you not, then, die first, having given such a judgment? He said, And how, O king, will you prove <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, after saying that you would kill first the first man that answered very badly?</p>

<p>And that the Greeks are called pilferers of all manner of writing, is, as I think, sufficiently demonstrated by abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Greeks Had Some Knowledge of the True God</h2>

<p>And that the men of highest repute among the Greeks <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but by indirect expression,  Peter says in the <em>Preaching:</em> <q>Know then that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, who made the beginning of all things, and holds the power of the end; and is the Invisible, who sees all things; incapable of being contained, who contains all things; needing nothing, whom all things need, and by whom they are; incomprehensible, everlasting, unmade, who made all things by the 'Word of His power,' that is, according to the gnostic scripture, His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> </p>

<p>Then he adds: <q>Worship this God not as the Greeks,</q>&mdash; signifying plainly, that the excellent among the Greeks worshipped the same God as we, but that they had not learned by perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that which was delivered by the Son. <q>Do not then worship,</q> he did not say, the God whom the Greeks worship, but <q>as the Greeks,</q>&mdash; changing the manner of the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not announcing another God. What, then, the expression <q>not as the Greeks</q> means, Peter himself shall explain, as he adds: <q>Since they are carried away by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God</q> (as we do, according to the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>); <q>but giving shape to the things  of which He gave them the power for use&mdash; stocks and stones, brass and iron, gold and silver&mdash; matter&mdash;and setting up the things which are slaves for use and possession, worship them.  And what God has given to them for food&mdash; the fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, and the creeping things of the earth, and the wild beasts with the four-footed cattle of the field, weasels and mice, cats and dogs and apes, and their own proper food&mdash; they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> as <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to mortals; and offering dead things to the dead, as to gods, are unthankful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, denying His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by these things.</q> And that it is said, that we and the Greeks <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though not in the same way, he will infer thus: <q>Neither worship as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for they, thinking that they only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, adoring as they do <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels, the month and the moon. And if the moon be not visible, they do not hold the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which is called the first;  nor do they hold the new moon, nor the feast of unleavened bread, nor the feast, nor the great day.</q>  Then he gives the finishing stroke to the question: <q>So do that also, learning holily and righteously what we deliver to you; keep them, <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a new way, by Christ.</q> For we find in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, as the Lord says: <q>Behold, I make with you a new covenant, not as I made with your fathers in Mount Horeb.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023259"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:31-32</a>; <a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse8">Hebrews&nbsp;8:8-10</a></span> He made a new covenant with us; for what belonged to the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is old. But we, who worship Him in a new way, in the third form, are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For clearly, as I think, he showed that the one and only God was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the Greeks in a Gentile way, by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> Judaically, and in a new and spiritual way by us.</p>

<p>And further, that the same God that furnished both the Covenants was the giver of Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to the Greeks, by which the Almighty is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the Greeks, he shows. And it is clear from this. Accordingly, then, from the Hellenic training, and also from that of the law are gathered into the one race of the saved people those who accept <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: not that the three peoples are separated by time, so that one might suppose three natures, but trained in different Covenants of the one Lord, by the word of the one Lord. For that, as God wished to save the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by giving to them <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, so also by raising up <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of their own in their own tongue, as they were able to receive God's beneficence, He distinguished the most excellent of the Greeks from the common herd, in addition to <q> <em>Peter's Preaching</em>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> will show, saying: <q>Take also the Hellenic books, read the Sibyl, how it is shown that God is one, and how the future is indicated. And taking Hystaspes, read, and you will find much more luminously and distinctly the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> described, and how many kings shall draw up their forces against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, hating Him and those that bear His name, and His faithful ones, and His patience, and His coming.</q> Then in one word he asks us, <q>Whose is the world, and all that is in the world? Are they not God's?</q>  Wherefore Peter says, that the Lord said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: <q>If any one of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> then, wishes to repent, and by my name to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven him, after twelve years. Go forth into the world, that no one may say, We have not heard.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Gospel Was Preached to Jews and Gentiles in Hades. </h2>

<p>But as the proclamation [of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>] has come now at the fit time, so also at the fit time were the Law and the Prophets given to the Barbarians, and Philosophy to the Greeks, to fit their ears for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>Therefore,</q> says the Lord who delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <q>in an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> have I helped you. And I have given you for a Covenant to the nations; that you might inhabit the earth, and receive the inheritance of the wilderness; saying to those that are in bonds, Come forth; and to those that are in darkness, Show yourselves.</q> For if the <q>prisoners</q> are the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom the Lord said, <q>Come forth, you that will, from your bonds,</q>&mdash; meaning the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> bound, and who have taken on them <q> <em>the burdens grievous to be borne</em></q> <span class="stiki" id="note023262"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;23:4</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;11:46</a></span> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> injunction&mdash; it is plain that <q>those in darkness</q> are they who have the ruling faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> buried in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<p>For to those who were righteous according to the law, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was wanting. Wherefore also the Lord, in healing them, said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you.</q>  But to those that were righteous according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, not only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, but also the abandonment of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, were necessary. Straightway, on the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they also repented of their previous conduct.</p>

<p>Wherefore the Lord preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those in Hades. Accordingly the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Hades says to Destruction, We have not seen His form, but we have heard His voice.</q>  It is not plainly the place, which, the words above say, heard the voice, but those who have been put in Hades, and have abandoned themselves to destruction, as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have thrown themselves voluntarily from a ship into the sea. They, then, are those that hear the divine power and voice. For who in his senses can suppose the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous and those of sinners in the same condemnation, charging Providence with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>?</p>

<p>But how? Do not [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>] show that the Lord preached  the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those that perished in the flood, or rather had been chained, and to those kept <q>in ward and guard</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note023266"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:19-20</a></span> And it has been shown also,  in the second book of the <em>Stromata</em>, that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, following the Lord, preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those in Hades. For it was requisite, in my opinion, that as here, so also there, the best of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should be imitators of the Master; so that He should bring to repentance those belonging to the Hebrews, and they the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; that is, those who had lived in righteousness according to the Law and Philosophy, who had ended life not perfectly, but sinfully. For it was suitable to the divine administration, that those possessed of greater worth in righteousness, and whose life had been pre-eminent, on repenting of their transgressions, though found in another place, yet being confessedly of the number of the people of God Almighty, should be saved, each one according to his individual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>And, as I think, the Saviour also exerts His might because it is His work to save; which accordingly He also did by drawing to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> those who became willing, by the preaching [of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>], to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, wherever they were. If, then, the Lord descended to Hades for no other end but to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as He did descend; it was either to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to all or to the Hebrews only. If, accordingly, to all, then all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> shall be saved, although they may be of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, on making their profession there; since God's punishments are saving and disciplinary, leading to conversion, and choosing rather the repentance them the death of a sinner;  and especially since <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, although darkened by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, when released from their bodies, are able to perceive more clearly, because of their being no longer obstructed by the paltry flesh.</p>

<p>If, then, He preached only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who wanted the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, it is plain that, since God is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also, as here, so there preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who were ready for conversion. And it is well said by the Shepherd, <q>They went down with them therefore into the water, and again ascended. But these descended alive, and again ascended alive. But those who had fallen asleep, descended dead, but ascended alive.</q>  Further the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note023270"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52</a></span> says, <q>that many bodies of those that slept arose,</q>&mdash; plainly as having been translated to a better state.  There took place, then, a universal movement and translation through the economy of the Saviour. </p>

<p>One righteous man, then, differs not, as righteous, from another righteous man, whether he be of the Law or a Greek. For God is not only Lord of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and more nearly the Father of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. For if to live well and according to the law is to live, also to live rationally according to the law is to live; and those who lived rightly before the Law were classed under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and judged to be righteous&mdash;it is evident that those, too, who were outside of the Law, having lived rightly, in consequence of the peculiar nature of the voice,  though they are in Hades and in ward, <span class="stiki" id="note023275"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:19</a></span> on hearing the voice of the Lord, whether that of His own person or that acting through His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, with all speed turned and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For we remember that the Lord is <q>the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023276"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and power can never be weak.</p>

<p>So I think it is demonstrated that the God being good, and the Lord powerful, they save with a righteousness and equality which extend to all that turn to Him, whether here or elsewhere. For it is not here alone that the active power of God is beforehand, but it is everywhere and is always at work. Accordingly, in the <em>Preaching of Peter</em>, the Lord says to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after the resurrection, <q>I have chosen you twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, judging you worthy of me,</q> whom the Lord wished to be <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, having judged them faithful, sending them into the world to the men on the earth, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, showing clearly what would take place by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ; that they who heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> should be saved; and that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, after having heard, should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, not having the excuse to allege, We have not heard.</p>

<p>What then? Did not the same dispensation obtain in Hades, so that even there, all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, on hearing the proclamation, might either exhibit repentance, or confess that their punishment was just, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not? And it were the exercise of no ordinary arbitrariness, for those who had departed before the advent of the Lord (not having the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> preached to them, and having afforded no ground from themselves, in consequence of believing or not) to obtain either <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or punishment. For it is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the advent should have the advantage of the divine righteousness. But to all rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> it was said from above, <q>Whatever one of you has done in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, without clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if, on becoming conscious, he repent, all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will be forgiven him.</q>  <q>For, behold,</q> it is said, <q>I have set before your face death and life, that you may choose life.</q>  God says that He set, not that He made both, in order to the comparison of choice. And in another Scripture He says, <q>If you hear Me, and be willing, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you hear Me not, and are not willing, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023279"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> </p>

<p>Again, David expressly (or rather the Lord in the person of the saint, and the same from the foundation of the world is each one who at different periods is saved, and shall be saved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) says, <q>My heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced, and my flesh shall still rest in hope. For You shall not leave my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, nor will You give Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one to see corruption. You have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me the paths of life, You will make me full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in Your presence.</q>  As, then, the people was precious to the Lord, so also is the entire <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people; he also who is converted from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who was prophesied under the name of <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a>, along with the Jew. For rightly the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, that <q>the ox and the bear shall come together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023281"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;11:7</a></span> For the Jew is designated by the ox, from the animal under the yoke being reckoned clean, according to the law; for the ox both parts the hoof and chews the cud. And the Gentile is designated by the bear, which is an unclean and wild beast. And this animal brings forth a shapeless lump of flesh, which it shapes into the likeness of a beast solely by its tongue. For he who is convened from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> is formed from a beastlike life to gentleness by the word; and, when once tamed, is made clean, just as the ox. For example, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>The sirens, and the daughters of the sparrows, and all the beasts of the field, shall bless me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023282"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;43:20</a></span> Of the number of unclean animals, the wild beasts of the field are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be, that is, of the world; since those who are wild in respect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and polluted in life, and not purified by the righteousness which is according to the law, are called wild beasts. But changed from wild beasts by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, they become men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, advancing from the wish to change to the fact. For some the Lord exhorts, and to those who have already made the attempt he stretches forth His hand, and draws them up. <q>For the Lord dreads not the face of any one, nor will He regard greatness; for He has made small and great, and cares alike for all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023283"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;6:7</a></span> And David says, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are fixed in the destruction they have caused; their foot is taken in the snare which they hid.</q>  <q>But the Lord was a refuge to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, a help in season also in affliction.</q>  Those, then, that were in affliction had the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> seasonably proclaimed. And therefore it said, <q>Declare among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> his pursuits,</q>  that they may not be judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</p>

<p>If, then, He preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those in the flesh that they might not be condemned <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, how is it conceivable that He did not for the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to those who had departed this life before His advent? <q>For the righteous Lord loves righteousness: His countenance beholds uprightness.</q>  <q>But he that loves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> </p>

<p>If, then, in the deluge all sinful flesh perished, punishment having been inflicted on them for correction, we must first <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is disciplinary and beneficent,  saves those who turn to Him. Then, too, the more subtle substance, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, could never receive any injury from the grosser element of water, its subtle and simple nature rendering it impalpable, called as it is incorporeal. But whatever is gross, made so in consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this is cast away along with the carnal spirit which <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p>

<p>Now also <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, the Coryph&aelig;us of those who herald community, in his book on <em>The Intercourse of Friends</em>, writes in these words: <q>Many of the things that are written, though in common books, are found written in the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For those sayings which proceed from the heart are vain. For the law written in the heart is the People  of the Beloved&mdash; loved and loving Him.</q> For whether it be the Jewish writings or those of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that he calls <q>the Common Books,</q> he makes the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> common. And Isidore,  at once son and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, in the first book of the <em>Expositions of the Prophet Parchor</em>, writes also in these words: <q>The Attics say that certain things were intimated to Socrates, in consequence of a d&aelig;mon attending on him. And Aristotle says that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are provided with d&aelig;mons, that attend on them during the time they are in the body&mdash;having taken this piece of prophetic instruction and transferred it to his own books, without acknowledging whence he had abstracted this statement.</q> And again, in the second book of his work, he thus writes: <q>And let no one think that what we say is peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, was said before by any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. For it is not a discovery of theirs. For having appropriated it from our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, they attributed it to him who is wise according to them.</q> Again, in the same: <q>For to me it appears that those who profess to philosophize, do so that they may learn what is the winged oak,  and the variegated robe on it, all of which Pherecydes has employed as theological allegories, having taken them from the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Cham.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. What True Philosophy Is, and Whence So Called</h2>

<p>As we have long ago pointed out, what we propose as our subject is not the discipline which obtains in each <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but that which is really <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, strictly systematic Wisdom, which furnishes acquaintance with the things which pertain to life. And we define Wisdom to be certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, being a sure and irrefragable apprehension of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, comprehending the present, past, and future, which the Lord has taught us, both by His advent and by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And it is irrefragable by reason, inasmuch as it has been communicated. And so it is wholly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> according to [God's] intention, as being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through means of the Son. And in one aspect it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and in another it becomes useful in time. Partly it is one and the same, partly many and indifferent&mdash; partly without any movement of passion, partly with passionate desire&mdash; partly perfect, partly incomplete.</p>

<p>This wisdom, then&mdash; rectitude of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of reason, and purity of life&mdash; is the object of the desire of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which is kindly and lovingly disposed towards wisdom, and does everything to attain it.</p>

<p>Now those are called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, among us, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Wisdom, the Creator and Teacher of all things, that is, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and among the Greeks, those who undertake arguments on <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Philosophy, then, consists of such <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> found in each <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (I mean those of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>) as cannot be impugned, with a corresponding life, collected into one selection; and these, stolen from the Barbarian God-given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, have been adorned by Greek speech. For some they have borrowed, and others they have misunderstood. And in the case of others, what they have spoken, in consequence of being moved, they have not yet perfectly worked out; and others by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conjecture and reasoning, in which also they stumble. And they think that they have hit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> perfectly; but as we understand them, only partially. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, nothing more than this world. And it is just like geometry, which treats of measures and magnitudes and forms, by delineation on plane-surfaces; and just as painting appears to take in the whole field of view in the scenes represented. But it gives a false description of the view, according to the rules of the art, employing the signs that result from the incidents of the lines of vision. By this means, the higher and lower points in the view, and those between, are preserved; and some objects seem to appear in the foreground, and others in the background, and others to appear in some other way, on the smooth and level surface. So also the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> copy the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, after the manner of painting. And always in the case of each one of them, their self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all their mistakes. Wherefore one ought not, in the desire for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that terminates in men, to be animated by self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to become really <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> with wisdom. If, then, one treats what is particular as universal, and regards that, which serves, as the Lord, he misses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not understanding what was spoken by David by way of confession: <q>I have eaten earth [ashes] like bread.</q>  Now, self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and self-conceit are, in his view, earth and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But if so, science and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are derived from instruction. And if there is instruction, you must seek for the master. Cleanthes claims Zeno, and Metrodorus <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, and Theophrastus Aristotle, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> Socrates. But if I come to Pythagoras, and Pherecydes, and Thales, and the first wise men, I come to a stand in my search for their teacher. Should you say the Egyptians, the Indians, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> themselves, I will not stop from asking their teacher. And I lead you up to the first generation of men; and from that point I begin to investigate Who is their teacher. No one of men; for they had not yet learned. Nor yet any of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for in the way that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in virtue of being <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, speak, men do not hear; nor, as we have ears, have they a tongue to correspond; nor would any one attribute to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> organs of speech, lips I mean, and the parts contiguous, throat, and windpipe, and chest, breath and air to vibrate. And God is far from calling aloud in the unapproachable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, separated as He is from even the archangels.</p>

<p>And we also have already heard that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> learned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and their rulers over them;  for they had a beginning. It remains, then, for us, ascending to seek their teacher. And since the unoriginated Being is one, the Omnipotent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; one, too, is the First-begotten, <q>by whom all things were made, and without whom not one thing ever was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023296"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <q>For one, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who formed the beginning of all things;</q> pointing out <q>the first-begotten Son,</q> Peter writes, accurately comprehending the statement, <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023297"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> And He is called Wisdom by all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. This is He who is the Teacher of all created beings, the Fellow-counsellor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who foreknew all things; and He from above, from the first foundation of the world, <q>in many ways and many times,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023298"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> trains and perfects; whence it is rightly said, <q>Call no man your teacher on earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023299"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;23:8-10</a></span> </p>

<p>You see whence the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has its handles; though the Law be the image and shadow of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for the Law is the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Greeks proclaims certain men as their teachers. As, then, the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> runs back to God the Creator; <span class="stiki" id="note023300"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;3:14-15</a></span> so also all the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which justifies, does to the Lord, and leads and contributes to this.</p>

<p>But if from any creature they received in any way whatever the seeds of the Truth, they did not nourish them; but committing them to a barren and rainless soil, they choked them with weeds, as the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> revolted from the Law, by introducing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teachings&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these being not the Teacher, but those who choose to disobey. But those of them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the Lord's advent and the plain teaching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the law; as also those addicted to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, by the teaching of the Lord, are introduced into the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: <q>For the oracles of the Lord are pure oracles, melted in the fire, tried in the earth,  purified seven times.</q>  Just as silver often purified, so is the just man brought to the test, becoming the Lord's coin and receiving the royal image. Or, since Solomon also calls the <q>tongue of the righteous man gold that has been subjected to fire,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023303"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;10:20</a></span> intimating that the doctrine which has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and is wise, is to be praised and received, whenever it is amply tried by the earth: that is, when the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in manifold ways sanctified, through withdrawal from earthy fires. And the body in which it dwells is purified, being appropriated to the pureness of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple. But the first purification which takes place in the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being first, is abstinence from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, which some consider perfection, and is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the perfection of the common believer&mdash; Jew and Greek. But in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, after that which is reckoned perfection in others, his righteousness advances to activity in well-doing. And in whomsoever the increased force  of righteousness advances to the doing of good, in his case perfection abides in the fixed habit of well-doing after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For those who are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and besides servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are <q>the called;</q> and the sons of Jacob are the elect&mdash; they who have tripped up the energy of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>If; then, we assert that Christ Himself is Wisdom, and that it was His working which showed itself in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, by which the gnostic tradition may be learned, as He Himself taught the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> during His presence; then it follows that the <em>gnosis</em>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and apprehension of things present, future, and past, which is sure and reliable, as being imparted and revealed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is wisdom.</p>

<p>And if, too, the end of the wise man is <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, that of those who are still <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> aims at it, but never attains it, unless by the process of learning it receives the prophetic utterance which has been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, by which it grasps both the present, the future, and the past&mdash; how they are, were, and shall be.</p>

<p>And the <em>gnosis</em> itself is that which has descended by transmission to a few, having been imparted unwritten by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Hence, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or wisdom ought to be exercised up to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable habit of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Philosophy is Knowledge Given by God</h2>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too, in the Epistles, plainly does not disparage <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; but deems it unworthy of the man who has attained to the elevation of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, any more to go back to the Hellenic <q><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,</q> figuratively calling it <q>the rudiments of this world,</q>  as being most rudimentary, and a preparatory training for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore also, writing to the Hebrews, who were declining again from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the law, he says, <q>Have you not need again of one to teach you which are the first principles of the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023306"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;5:12</a></span> So also to the Colossians, who were Greek converts, <q>Beware lest any man spoil you by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023307"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> &mdash; enticing them again to return to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the elementary doctrine.</p>

<p>And should one say that it was through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was discovered by the Greeks, still I find the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> saying that understanding is sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The psalmist, accordingly, considers understanding as the greatest free gift, and beseeches, saying, <q>I am Your servant; give me understanding.</q>  And does not David, while asking the abundant experience of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, write, <q>Teach me gentleness, and discipline, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Your commandments?</q>  He confessed the covenants to be of the highest authority, and that they were given to the more excellent. Accordingly the psalm again says of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He has not done thus to any nation; and He has not shown His judgments to them.</q>  The expression <q>He has not done so</q> shows that <em>He has done</em>, but not <q>thus.</q> The <q>thus,</q> then, is put comparatively, with reference to pre-eminence, which obtains in our case. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might have said simply, <q>He has not done,</q> without the <q>thus.</q></p>

<p>Further, Peter in the Acts says, <q>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I perceive that God is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; but in every nation he that fears Him, and works righteousness, is accepted by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023311"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts&nbsp;10:34-35</a></span> </p> 

<p>The absence of respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in God is not then in time, but from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Nor had His beneficence a beginning; nor any more is it limited to places or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For His beneficence is not confined to parts. <q>Open the gates of righteousness,</q> it is said; <q>entering into them, I will confess to the Lord . This is the gate of the Lord . The righteous shall enter by it.</q>  Explaining the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> saying, Barnabas adds, <q>There being many gates open, that which is in righteousness is the gate which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which all who enter are blessed.</q> Bordering on the same meaning is also the following prophetic utterance: <q>The Lord is on many waters;</q>  not the different covenants alone, but the modes of teaching, those among the Greek and those among the Barbarians, conducing to righteousness. And already clearly David, bearing testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, sings, <q>Let sinners be turned into Hades, and all the nations that forget God.</q>  They forget, plainly, Him whom they formerly remembered, and dismiss Him whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> previous to forgetting Him. There was then a dim <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God also among the nations. So much for those points.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> must be erudite. And since the Greeks say that Protagoras having led the way, the opposing of one argument by another was invented, it is fitting that something be said with reference to arguments of this sort. For <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>He that says much, shall also hear in his turn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023315"><a href="../bible/job011.htm#verse2">Job&nbsp;11:2</a></span> And who shall understand a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the Lord, but the wise, the intelligent, and he that loves his Lord? Let such a man be faithful; let him be capable of uttering his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; let him be wise in the discrimination of words; let him be dexterous in action; let him be pure. <q>The greater he seems to be, the more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> should he be,</q> says Clement in the Epistle to the Corinthians,&mdash; <q>such an one as is capable of complying with the precept, 'And some pluck from the fire, and on others have compassion, making a difference,'</q> </p>

<p>The pruning-hook is made, certainly, principally for pruning; but with it we separate twigs that have got intertwined, cut the thorns which grow along with the vines, which it is not very easy to reach. And all these things have a reference to pruning. Again, man is made principally for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he also measures land, practices agriculture, and philosophizes; of which pursuits, one conduces to life, another to living well, a third to the study of the things which are capable of demonstration. Further, let those who say that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> took its rise from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that <q>the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is transformed into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023317"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> When about to do what? Plainly, when about to prophesy. But if he prophesies as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, he will speak what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And if he prophesies what is angelical, and of the light, then he prophesies what is beneficial when he is transformed according to the likeness of the operation, though he be different with respect to the matter of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. For how could he deceive any one, without drawing the lover of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> into fellowship, and so drawing him afterwards into <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? Especially he will be found to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if not so as to comprehend it, yet so as not to be unacquainted with it.</p>

<p>Philosophy is not then false, though the thief and the liar speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, through a transformation of operation. Nor is sentence of condemnation to be pronounced <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> against what is said, on account of him who says it (which also is to be kept in view, in the case of those who are now alleged to prophesy); but what is said must be looked at, to see if it keep by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>And in general terms, we shall not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in alleging that all things necessary and profitable for life came to us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> more especially was given to the Greeks, as a covenant peculiar to them&mdash; being, as it is, a stepping-stone to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which is according to Christ&mdash; although those who applied themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Greeks shut their ears voluntarily to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, despising the voice of Barbarians, or also dreading the danger suspended over the believer, by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the state.</p>

<p>And as in the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, so also in the Hellenic, <q>tares were sown</q> by the proper husbandman of the tares; whence also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> grew up among us along with the productive wheat; and those who in the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> preach the impiety and voluptuousness of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, and whatever other tenets are disseminated contrary to right reason, exist among the Greeks as spurious fruits of the divinely bestowed husbandry. This voluptuous and selfish <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> the apostle calls <q>the wisdom of this world;</q> in consequence of its teaching the things of this world and about it alone, and its consequent subjection, as far as respects ascendancy, to those who rule here. Wherefore also this fragmentary <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is very elementary, while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> perfect science deals with intellectual objects, which are beyond the sphere of the world, and with the objects still more spiritual than those which <q>eye saw not, and ear heard not, nor did it enter into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> till the Teacher told the account of them to us; unveiling the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies; and in ascending order, things still holier than these, to those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and not spuriously heirs of the Lord's adoption. For we now dare aver (for here is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is characterized by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ) that such an one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, and comprehends all things in the exercise of sure apprehension, respecting matters difficult for us, and really pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gnosis  such as were James, Peter, John, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), inasmuch as it was given by the Lord, and again explained by the Lord to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) an attribute of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which trains itself for this, that by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it may become entitled to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? For both are powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and impulse. And impulse is found to be a movement after an assent. For he who has an impulse towards an action, first receives the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the action, and secondly the impulse. Let us further devote our attention to this. For since learning is older than action; (for naturally, he who does what he wishes to do learns it first; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes from learning, and impulse follows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; after which comes action;) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> turns out the beginning and author of all rational action. So that rightly the peculiar nature of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is characterized by this alone; for in reality impulse, like <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is excited by existing objects. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) is essentially a <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of existences on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, either of a certain thing or of certain things, and when perfected, of all together. Although some say that the wise man is persuaded that there are some things incomprehensible, in such wise as to have respecting them a kind of comprehension, inasmuch as he comprehends that things incomprehensible are incomprehensible; which is common, and pertains to those who are capable of perceiving little. For such a man affirms that there are some things incomprehensible.</p>

<p>But that <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> of whom I speak, himself comprehends what seems to be incomprehensible to others; believing that nothing is incomprehensible to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whence nothing incapable of being taught. For He who suffered out of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for us, would have suppressed no element of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requisite for our instruction. Accordingly this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes sure demonstration; since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> follows what has been delivered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if one desires extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <q>he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things ancient, and conjectures things future; he understands knotty sayings, and the solutions of enigmas. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of wisdom foreknows signs and omens, and the issues of seasons and of times.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023320"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse17">Wisdom&nbsp;7:17-18</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Gnostic Free of All Perturbations of the Soul</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is such, that he is subject only to the affections that exist for the maintenance of the body, such as hunger, thirst, and the like. But in the case of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, it were ludicrous [to suppose] that the body, as a body, demanded the necessary aids in order to its duration. For He ate, not for the sake of the body, which was kept together by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> energy, but in order that it might not enter into the minds of those who were with Him to entertain a different opinion of Him; in like manner as certainly some afterwards supposed that He appeared in a phantasmal shape (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>). But He was entirely impassible (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F75;&#x03C2;</span>); inaccessible to any movement of feeling&mdash; either pleasure or pain. While the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, having most gnostically mastered, through the Lord's teaching, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, were not liable even to such of the movements of feeling, as seem good, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, desire, through a steady condition of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not changing a whit; but ever continuing unvarying in a state of training after the resurrection of the Lord.</p>

<p>And should it be granted that the affections specified above, when produced rationally, are good, yet they are nevertheless inadmissible in the case of the perfect man, who is incapable of exercising <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>: for neither does he meet what inspires <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, as he regards none of the things that occur in life as to be dreaded; nor can anything dislodge him from this&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he has towards God. Nor does he need cheerfulness of mind; for he does not fall into pain, being persuaded that all things happen well. Nor is he <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; for there is nothing to move him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, seeing he ever loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is entirely turned towards Him alone, and therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> none of God's creatures. No more does he <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; for nothing is wanting to him, that is requisite to assimilation, in order that he may be excellent and good. Nor does he consequently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> any one with this common affection, but loves the Creator in the creatures. Nor, consequently, does he fall into any desire and eagerness; nor does he want, as far as respects his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, anything appertaining to others, now that he associates through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with the Beloved One, to whom he is allied by free choice, and by the habit which results from training, approaches closer to Him, and is blessed through the abundance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</p>

<p>So that on these accounts he is compelled to become like his Teacher in impassibility. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is intellectual, according as the image of mind is seen  in man alone. Thus also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is godlike in form and semblance as respects his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And, on the other hand, God is like man. For the distinctive form of each one is the mind by which we are characterized. Consequently, also, those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against man are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> and impious. For it were ridiculous to say that the gnostic and perfect man must not eradicate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, inasmuch as without these he will not struggle against circumstances, or abide what is terrible. But if we take from him desire, he will be quite overwhelmed by troubles, and therefore depart from this life very basely. Unless possessed of it, as some suppose, he will not conceive a desire for what is like the excellent and the good. If, then, all alliance with what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is accompanied with desire, how, it is said, does he remain impassible who desires what is excellent?</p>

<p>But these people <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, as appears, the divinity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is not desire on the part of him who loves; but is a relation of affection, restoring the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;independent of time and place. But he who by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is already in the midst of that in which he is destined to be, and has anticipated hope by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, does not desire anything, having, as far as possible, the very thing desired. Accordingly, as to be expected, he continues in the exercise of gnostic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in the one unvarying state.</p>

<p>Nor will he, therefore, eagerly desire to be assimilated to what is beautiful, possessing, as he does, beauty by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. What more need of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and of desire to him, who has obtained the affinity to the impassible God which arises from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has enrolled himself among the friends of God?</p>

<p>We must therefore rescue the gnostic and perfect man from all passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) produces practice, and practice habit or disposition; and such a state as this produces impassibility, not moderation of passion. And the complete eradication of desire reaps as its fruit impassibility. But the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> does not share either in those affections that are commonly celebrated as good, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the affections which are allied to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: such, I mean, as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, which is allied to pleasure; and dejection, for this is conjoined with pain; and caution, for it is subject to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Nor yet does he share in high spirit, for it takes its place alongside of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; although some say that these are no longer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but already good. For it is impossible that he who has been once made perfect by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and feasts <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> and insatiably on the boundless <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, should delight in small and grovelling things. For what rational <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains any more to the man who has gained <q>the light inaccessible,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023322"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> for revering to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the world? Although not yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as to time and place, yet by that gnostic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> through which the inheritance and perfect restitution follow, the giver of the reward makes good by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> what the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, by gnostic choice, had grasped by anticipation through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>For by going away to the Lord, for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he bears Him, though his tabernacle be visible on earth, he does not withdraw himself from life. For that is not permitted to him. But he has withdrawn his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For that is granted to him. And on the other hand he lives, having <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and no longer makes use of the body, but allows it the use of necessaries, that he may not give <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for dissolution.</p>

<p>How, then, has he any more need of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, who is not in the midst of dangers, being not present, but already wholly with the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? And what necessity for self-restraint to him who has not need of it? For to have such desires, as require self-restraint in order to their control, is characteristic of one who is not yet pure, but subject to passion. Now, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is assumed by reason of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and cowardice. For it were no longer seemly that the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has fore-ordained before the foundation of the world</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023323"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> to be enrolled in the highest <q>adoption,</q> should fall into pleasures or fears, and be occupied in the repression of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For I venture to assert, that as he is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> through what he shall do, and what he shall obtain, so also has he <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> himself by reason of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and whom he loved; not having the future indistinct, as the multitude live, conjecturing it, but having grasped by gnostic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> what is hidden from others. And through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the future is for him already present. For he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, through <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the advent, on God who lies not. And what he believes he possesses, and keeps hold of the promise. And He who has promised is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And through the trustworthiness of Him who has promised, he has firmly laid hold of the end of the promise by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And he, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the sure comprehension of the future which there is in the circumstances, in which he is placed, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> goes to meet the future. So he, that is persuaded that he will obtain the things that are really good, will not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to obtain what is here, but that he may always cling to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which hits the mark and succeeds. And besides, he will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that as many as possible may become like him, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is perfected through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For he who is made like the Saviour is also devoted to saving; performing unerringly the commandments as far as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may admit of the image. And this is to worship God by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness. The Lord will not wait for the voice of this man in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <q>Ask,</q> He says, <q>and I will do it; think, and I will give.</q> </p>

<p>For, in fine, it is impossible that the immutable should assume firmness and consistency in the mutable. But the ruling faculty being in perpetual change, and therefore unstable, the force of habit is not maintained. For how can he who is perpetually changed by external occurrences and accidents, ever possess habit and disposition, and in a word, grasp of scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;</span>)? Further, also, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> regard the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as habits, dispositions, and sciences. And as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) is not born with men, but is acquired,  and the acquiring of it in its elements demands application, and training, and progress; and then from incessant practice it passes into a habit; so, when perfected in the mystic habit, it abides, being infallible through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For not only has he apprehended the first Cause, and the Cause produced by it, and is sure about them, possessing firmly firm and irrefragable and immoveable reasons; but also respecting what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and respecting all production, and to speak comprehensively, respecting all about which the Lord has spoken, he has learned, from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, the most exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the foundation of the world to the end. Not preferring to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself what appears plausible, or, according to Hellenic reasoning, necessary; but what has been spoken by the Lord he accepts as clear and evident, though concealed from others; and he has already received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things. And the oracles we possess give their utterances respecting what exists, as it is; and respecting what is future, as it shall be; and respecting what is past, as it was.</p>

<p>In scientific matters, as being alone possessed of scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he will hold the preeminence, and will discourse on the discussion respecting the good, ever intent on intellectual objects, tracing out his procedure in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs from the archetypes above; as navigators direct the ship according to the star; prepared to hold himself in readiness for every suitable action; accustomed to despise all difficulties and dangers when it is necessary to undergo them; never doing anything precipitate or incongruous either to himself or the common good; foreseeing; and inflexible by pleasures both of waking hours and of dreams. For, accustomed to spare living and frugality, he is moderate, active, and grave; requiring few necessaries for life; occupying himself with nothing superfluous. But desiring not even these things as chief, but by reason of fellowship in life, as necessary for his sojourn in life, as far as necessary.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Gnostic Avails Himself of the Help of All Human Knowledge</h2>

<p>For to him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) is the principal thing. Consequently, therefore, he applies to the subjects that are a training for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, taking from each branch of study its contribution to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Prosecuting, then, the proportion of harmonies in music; and in arithmetic noting the increasing and decreasing of numbers, and their relations to one another, and how the most of things fall under some proportion of numbers; studying geometry, which is abstract <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, he perceives a continuous distance, and an immutable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is different from these bodies. And by astronomy, again, raised from the earth in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he is elevated along with heaven, and will revolve with its revolution; studying ever divine things, and their harmony with each other; from which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> starting, ascended to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him who created them. Further, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will avail himself of dialectics, fixing on the distinction of genera into species, and will master  the distinction of existences, till he come to what are primary and simple.</p>

<p>But the multitude are frightened at the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as children are at masks, being afraid lest it lead them astray. But if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for I cannot call it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>) which they possess be such as to be dissolved by plausible speech, let it be by all means dissolved,  and let them confess that they will not retain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is immoveable; but false opinion dissolves. We choose, for instance, one purple by comparison with another purple. So that, if one confesses that he has not a heart that has been made right, he has not the table of the money-changers or the test of words.  And how can he be any longer a money-changer, who is not able to prove and distinguish spurious coin, even offhand?</p>

<p>Now David cried, <q>The righteous shall not be shaken for ever;</q>  neither, consequently, by deceptive speech nor by erring pleasure. Whence he shall never be shaken from his own heritage. <q>He shall not be afraid of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tidings;</q>  consequently neither of unfounded <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, nor of the false opinion around him. No more will he dread cunning words, who is capable of distinguishing them, or of answering rightly to questions asked. Such a bulwark are dialectics, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be trampled under foot by the Sophists. <q>For it behooves those who praise in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name of the Lord,</q> according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in heart, seeking the Lord. Seek then Him, and be strong. Seek His face continually in every way.</q>  <q>For, having spoken at sundry times and in various manners,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023332"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> it is not in one way only that He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>It is, then, not by availing himself of these as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will be deeply learned. But by using them as helps in distinguishing what is common and what is peculiar, he will admit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and false opinion, is inability to distinguish in what respect things are common, and in what respects they differ. For unless, in things that are distinct, one closely watch speech, he will inadvertently confound what is common and what is peculiar. And where this takes place, he must of necessity fall into pathless tracts and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>The distinction of names and things also in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves produces great light in men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For it is necessary to understand expressions which signify several things, and several expressions when they signify one thing. The result of which is accurate answering. But it is necessary to avoid the great futility which occupies itself in irrelevant matters; since the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> avails himself of branches of learning as auxiliary preparatory exercises, in order to the accurate communication of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as far as attainable and with as little distraction as possible, and for defence against reasonings that plot for the extinction of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He will not then be deficient in what contributes to proficiency in the curriculum of studies and the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; but not principally, but necessarily, secondarily, and on account of circumstances. For what those labouring in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> use wickedly, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will use rightly.</p>

<p>Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that appears in the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, being partial, the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, like the sun glancing on the colours both white and black, shows what like each of them is. So also it exposes all sophistical plausibility. Rightly, then, was it proclaimed also by the Greeks:&mdash; <q>Truth the queen is the beginning of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Mystical Meanings in the Proportions of Numbers, Geometrical Ratios, and Music</h2>

<p>As then in astronomy we have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as an instance, so also in arithmetic we have the same <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <q>For, hearing that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was taken captive, and having numbered his own servants, born in his house, 318 (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x1F74;</span> ),</q> he defeats a very great number of the enemy.</p>

<p>They say, then, that the character representing 300 is, as to shape, the type of the Lord's sign,  and that the <em>Iota</em> and the <em>Eta</em> indicate the Saviour's name; that it was indicated, accordingly, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> domestics were in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who having fled to the Sign and the Name became lords of the captives, and of the very many unbelieving nations that followed them.</p>

<p>Now the number 300 is, 3 by 100. Ten is allowed to be the perfect number. And 8 is the first cube, which is equality in all the dimensions&mdash; length, breadth, depth. <q>The days of men shall be,</q> it is said, <q>120 (<span class="greek">&#x03C1;&#x03BA;<!--k29--&#x1FFD;</span>) years.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023336"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;6:3</a></span> And the sum is made up of the numbers from 1 to 15 added together.  And the moon at 15 days is full.</p>

<p>On another principle, 120 is a triangular  number, and consists of the equality  of the number 64, [which consists of eight of the odd numbers beginning with unity],  the addition of which (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) in succession generate squares;  and of the inequality of the number 56, consisting of seven of the even numbers beginning with 2 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), which produce the numbers that are not squares </p>

<p>Again, according to another way of indicating, the number 120 consists of four numbers&mdash; of one triangle, 15; of another, a square, 25; of a third, a pentagon, 35; and of a fourth, a hexagon, 45. The 5 is taken according to the same ratio in each mode. For in triangular numbers, from the unity 5 comes 15; and in squares, 25; and of those in succession, proportionally. Now 25, which is the number 5 from unity, is said to be the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Levitical tribe. And the number 35 depends also on the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic scale of doubles&mdash; 6, 8, 9, 12; the addition of which makes 35. In these days, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say that seven months' children are formed. And the number 45 depends on the scale of triples&mdash; 6, 9, 12, 18&mdash; the addition of which makes 45; and similarly, in these days they say that nine months' children are formed.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the style of the example in arithmetic. And let the testimony of geometry be the tabernacle that was constructed, and the ark that was fashioned&mdash;constructed in most regular proportions, and through divine ideas, by the gift of understanding, which leads us from things of sense to intellectual objects, or rather from these to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, and to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies. For the squares of wood indicate that the square form, producing right angles, pervades all, and points out security. And the length of the structure was three hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty, and the height thirty; and above, the ark ends in a cubit, narrowing to a cubit from the broad base like a pyramid, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of those who are purified and tested by fire. And this geometrical proportion has a place, for the transport of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> abodes, whose differences are indicated by the differences of the numbers set down below.</p>

<p>And the numbers introduced are sixfold, as three hundred is six times fifty; and tenfold, as three hundred is ten times thirty; and containing one and two-thirds (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F77;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>), for fifty is one and two-thirds of thirty.</p>

<p>Now there are some who say that three hundred cubits are the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Lord's sign;  and fifty, of hope and of the remission given at Pentecost; and thirty, or as in some, twelve, they say points out the preaching [of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>]; because the Lord preached in His thirtieth year; and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were twelve. And the structure's terminating in a cubit is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the advancement of the righteous to oneness and to <q>the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> </p>

<p>And the table which was in the temple was six cubits;  and its four feet were about a cubit and a half.</p>

<p>They add, then, the twelve cubits, agreeably to the revolution of the twelve months, in the annual circle, during which the earth produces and matures all things; adapting itself to the four seasons. And the table, in my opinion, exhibits the image of the earth, supported as it is on four feet, summer, autumn, spring, winter, by which the year travels. Wherefore also it is said that the table has <q>wavy chains;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023346"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;25:24</a></span> either because the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> revolves in the circuits of the times, or perhaps it indicated the earth surrounded with ocean's tide.</p>

<p>Further, as an example of music, let us adduce David, playing at once and prophesying, melodiously praising God. Now the Enarmonic  suits best the Dorian harmony, and the Diatonic the Phrygian, as Aristoxenus says. The harmony, therefore, of the Barbarian psaltery, which exhibited gravity of strain, being the most ancient, most certainly became a model for Terpander, for the Dorian harmony, who sings the praise of Zeus thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O Zeus, of all things the Beginning, Ruler of all; <br>O Zeus, I send you this beginning of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The lyre, according to its primary signification, may by the psalmist be used figuratively for the Lord; according to its secondary, for those who continually strike the chords of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> under the direction of the Choir-master, the Lord. And if the people saved be called the lyre, it will be understood to be in consequence of their giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> musically, through the inspiration of the Word and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being struck by the Word so as to produce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. You may take music in another way, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> symphony at once of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> along with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the harmony which obtained in each <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in the transitions of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>But, as seems, the most of those who are inscribed with the Name,  like the companions of Ulysses, handle the word unskilfully, passing by not the Sirens, but the rhythm and the melody, stopping their ears with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, after lending their ears to Hellenic studies, they will never subsequently be able to retrace their steps.</p>

<p>But he who culls what is useful for the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and especially when they are Greeks (and the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof ), must not abstain from erudition, like irrational animals; but he must collect as many aids as possible for his hearers. But he must by no means linger over these studies, except solely for the advantage accruing from them; so that, on grasping and obtaining this, he may be able to take his departure home to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which is a strong cable for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, providing security from everything.</p>

<p>Music is then to be handled for the sake of the embellishment and composure of manners. For instance, at a banquet we pledge each other while the music is playing;  soothing by song the eagerness of our desires, and glorifying God for the copious gift of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> enjoyments, for His perpetual supply of the food necessary for the growth of the body and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But we must reject superfluous music, which enervates men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and leads to variety&mdash;now mournful, and then licentious and voluptuous, and then frenzied and frantic.</p>

<p>The same holds also of astronomy. For treating of the description of the celestial objects, about the form of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and the revolution of the heavens, and the motion of the stars, leading the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nearer to the creative power, it teaches to quickness in perceiving the seasons of the year, the changes of the air, and the appearance of the stars; since also navigation and husbandry derive from this much benefit, as architecture and building from geometry. This branch of learning, too, makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the highest degree observant, capable of perceiving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and detecting the false, of discovering correspondences and proportions, so as to hunt out for similarity in things dissimilar; and conducts us to the discovery of length without breadth, and superficial extent without thickness, and an indivisible point, and transports to intellectual objects from those of sense.</p>

<p>The studies of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, are aids in treating of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For instance, the cloak was once a fleece; then it was shorn, and became warp and woof; and then it was woven. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be prepared and variously exercised, if it would become in the highest degree good. For there is the scientific and the practical element in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and the latter flows from the speculative; and there is need of great practice, and exercise, and experience.</p>

<p>But in speculation, one element relates to one's neighbours and another to one's self. Wherefore also training ought to be so moulded as to be adapted to both. He, then, who has acquired a competent acquaintance with the subjects which embrace the principles which conduce to scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), may stop and remain for the future in quiet, directing his actions in l conformity with his theory.</p>

<p>But for the benefit of one's neighbours, in the case of those who have proclivities for writing, and those who set themselves to deliver the word, both is other culture beneficial, and the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Lord is necessary, in order to the demonstration of what is said, and especially if those who hear are accessions from Hellenic culture.</p>

<p>Such David describes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: <q>The queen stood on your right hand, enveloped in a golden robe, variegated;</q>  and with Hellenic and superabundant accomplishments, <q>clothed variegated with gold-fringed garments.</q>  And the Truth says by the Lord, <q>For who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Your counsel, had You not given wisdom, and sent Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the Highest; and so the ways of those on earth were corrected, and men learned Your decrees, and were saved by wisdom?</q> For the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things ancient by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and conjectures things future: he understands the involutions of words and the solutions of enigmas. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> beforehand signs and wonders, and the issues of seasons and periods, as we have said already. Do you see the fountain of instructions that takes its rise from wisdom? But to those who object, What use is there in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the causes of the manner of the sun's motion, for example, and the rest of the heavenly bodies, or in having studied the theorems of geometry or logic, and each of the other branches of study?&mdash; for these are of no service in the discharge of duties, and the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, for it is incapable of teaching  the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; the following remarks are to be made. First, that they stumble in reference to the highest of things&mdash; namely, the mind's free choice. <q>For they,</q> it is said, <q>who keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, shall be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and those who have been taught will find an answer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023354"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse10">Wisdom&nbsp;6:10</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone will do holily, in accordance with reason all that has to be done, as he has learned through the Lord's teaching, received through men.</p>

<p>Again, on the other hand, we may hear: <q>For in His hand, that is, in His power and wisdom, are both we and our words, and all wisdom and skill in works; for God loves nothing but the man that dwells with wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023355"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse16">Wisdom&nbsp;7:16</a></span> And again, they have not read what is said by Solomon; for, treating of the construction of the temple, he says expressly, <q>And it was Wisdom as artificer that framed it; and Your <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, O Father, governs throughout.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023356"><a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse2">Wisdom&nbsp;14:2-3</a></span> And how irrational, to regard <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as inferior to architecture and shipbuilding! And the Lord fed the multitude of those that reclined on the grass opposite to Tiberias with the two fishes and the five barley loaves, indicating the preparatory training of the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> previous to the divine grain, which is the food cultivated by the law. For barley is sooner ripe for the harvest than wheat; and the fishes signified the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that was produced and moved in the midst of the Gentile billow, given, as they were, for copious food to those lying on the ground, increasing no more, like the fragments of the loaves, but having partaken of the Lord's blessing, and breathed into them the resurrection of Godhead  through the power of the Word. But if you are curious, understand one of the fishes to mean the curriculum of study, and the other the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which supervenes. The gatherings  point out the word of the Lord.</p> <blockquote><p><q>And the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of mute fishes rushed to it,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>says the Tragic Muse somewhere.</p>

<p><q>I must decrease,</q> said the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> John, <span class="stiki" id="note023359"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;3:30</a></span> and the Word of the Lord alone, in which the law terminates, <q>increase.</q> Understand now for me the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, granting pardon if I shrink from advancing further in the treatment of it, by announcing this alone: <q>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not even one thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023360"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Certainly He is called <q>the chief corner stone; in whom the whole building, fitly joined together, grows into an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023361"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20-21</a></span> according to the divine apostle.</p>

<p>I pass over in silence at present the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like a man who cast a net into the sea and out of the multitude of the fishes caught, makes a selection of the better ones.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023362"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse47">Matthew&nbsp;13:47-48</a></span> </p>

<p>And now the wisdom which we possess announces the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>  in such a way as to show that the sources of them were communicated by the Hebrews to the Greeks. This may be learned from the following: <q>And if one loves <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, its toils are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> teach <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; and than these there is nothing more useful in life to men.</q></p>

<p>Above all, this ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that by nature we are adapted for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; not so as to be possessed of it from our birth, but so as to be adapted for acquiring it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Human Nature Possesses an Adaptation for Perfection; The Gnostic Alone Attains It</h2>

<p>By which consideration  is solved the question propounded to us by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, Whether <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was created perfect or imperfect? Well, if imperfect, how could the work of a perfect God&mdash; above all, that work being man&mdash; be imperfect? And if perfect, how did he transgress the commandments? For they shall hear from us that he was not perfect in his creation, but adapted to the reception of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is of great importance in regard to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be made fit for its attainment. And it is intended that we should be saved by ourselves. This, then, is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to move of itself. Then, as we are rational, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> being rational, we have some affinity with it. Now an aptitude is a movement towards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself. All, then, as I said, are naturally constituted for the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>But one man applies less, one more, to learning and training. Wherefore also some have been competent to attain to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and others have attained to a kind of it. And some, on the other hand, through negligence, although in other respects of good dispositions, have turned to the opposite. Now much more is that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which excels all branches of culture in greatness and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, most difficult to acquire, and is attained with much toil. <q>But, as seems, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God created man for <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and made him an image of His own nature;</q>  according to which nature of Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all, he who is a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, and righteous, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, hastes to reach the measure of perfect manhood. For not only are actions and thoughts, but words also, pure in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>: <q>You have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> mine heart; You have visited me by night,</q> it is said; <q>You have subjected me to the fire, and unrighteousness was not found in me: so that my mouth shall not speak the works of men.</q> </p>

<p>And why do I say the works of men? He recognises <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, which is not brought forward in order to repentance (for this is common to all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>); but what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is. Nor does he condemn this or that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but simply all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; nor is it what one has done ill that he brings up, but what ought not to be done. Whence also repentance is twofold: that which is common, on account of having transgressed; and that which, from learning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, persuades, in the first instance, to keep from sinning, the result of which is not sinning.</p>

<p>Let them not then say, that he who does wrong and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> transgresses through the agency of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for then he would be guiltless. But by choosing the same things as <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, by sinning; being unstable, and light, and fickle in his desires, like a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, he becomes a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> man. Now he who is bad, having become, through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, sinful by nature, becomes depraved, having what he has chosen; and being sinful, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also in his actions. And again, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man does right. Wherefore we call not only the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but also right actions, good. And of things that are good we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some are desirable for themselves, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for we hunt for nothing from it when we have it, but only [seek] that it be with us, and that we be in uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and strive to reach it for its own sake. But other things are desirable for other considerations, such as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for escape from punishment, and the advantage arising from reward, which accrue from it. For, in the case of many, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their not sinning; and the promise is the means of pursuing <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, by which comes <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Knowledge, then, desirable as it is for its own sake, is the most perfect good; and consequently the things which follow by means of it are good. And punishment is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of correction to him who is punished; and to those who are able to see before them he becomes an example, to prevent them falling into the like.</p>

<p>Let us then receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not desiring its results, but embracing itself for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>. For the first advantage is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>), which furnishes harmless pleasures and exultation both for the present and the future. And exultation is said to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, being a reflection of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, through a kind of exhilaration and relaxation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And the acts which partake of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are good and fair actions. For abundance in the actions that are according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches, and destitution in decorous  desires is poverty. For the use and enjoyment of necessaries are not injurious in quality, but in quantity, when in excess. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> circumscribes his desires in reference both to possession and to enjoyment, not exceeding the limit of necessity. Therefore, regarding life in this world as necessary for the increase of science (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;</span>) and the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>), he will value highest, not living, but living well. He will therefore prefer neither children, nor marriage, nor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and righteousness in life. To such an one, his wife, after conception, is as a sister, and is judged as if of the same father; then only recollecting her husband, when she looks on the children; as being destined to become a sister in reality after putting off the flesh, which separates and limits the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who are spiritual by the peculiar characteristics of the sexes. For <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, themselves by themselves, are equal. Souls are neither male nor female, when they no longer marry nor are given in marriage. And is not <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> translated into man, when she has become equally unfeminine, and manly, and perfect? Such, then, was the laughter of Sarah <span class="stiki" id="note023368"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;18:12</a></span> when she received the good news of the birth of a son; not, in my opinion, that she disbelieved the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but that she felt ashamed of the intercourse by means of which she was destined to become the mother of a son.</p>

<p>And did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he was in danger on account of Sarah's beauty, with the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, properly call her sister, being of the same father, but not of the same mother? </p>

<p>To those, then, who have repented and not firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, God grants their requests through their supplications. But to those who live sinlessly and gnostically, He gives, when they have but merely entertained the thought. For example, to Anna, on her merely conceiving the thought, conception was vouchsafed of the child Samuel. <span class="stiki" id="note023370"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:13</a></span> <q>Ask,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>and I will do. Think, and I will give.</q> For we have heard that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the heart, not judging  the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from [external] movement, as we men; nor yet from the event. For it is ridiculous to think so. Nor was it as the architect praises the work when accomplished that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on making the light and then seeing it, called it good. But He, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> before He made it what it would be, praised that which was made, He having potentially made good, from the first by His purpose that had no beginning, what was destined to be good actually. Now that which has future He already said beforehand was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the phrase concealing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by hyperbaton. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in thought during every hour, being by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> allied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And first he will ask forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and after, that he may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more; and further, the power of well-doing and of comprehending the whole creation and administration by the Lord, that, becoming pure in heart through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he may be initiated into the beatific vision face to face, having heard the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which says, <q>Fasting with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is a good thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023372"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse8">Tobit&nbsp;12:8</a></span> </p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> signify abstinence from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> whatsoever, both in action and in word, and in thought itself. As appears, then, righteousness is quadrangular;  on all sides equal and like in word, in deed, in abstinence from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, in beneficence, in gnostic perfection; nowhere, and in no respect halting, so that he does not appear <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and unequal. As one, then, is righteous, so certainly is he a believer. But as he is a believer, he is not yet also righteous&mdash; I mean according to the righteousness of progress and perfection, according to which the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is called righteous.</p>

<p>For instance, on <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> becoming a believer, it was reckoned to him for righteousness, he having advanced to the greater and more perfect degree of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For he who merely abstains from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conduct is not just, unless he also attain besides beneficence and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and for this reason some things are to be abstained from, others are to be done. <q>By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023374"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> the apostle says, the righteous man is sent on to the inheritance above&mdash;by some [arms] defended, by others putting forth his might. For the defence of his panoply alone, and abstinence from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, are not sufficient for perfection, unless he assume in addition the work of righteousness&mdash; activity in doing good.</p>

<p>Then our dexterous man and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is revealed in righteousness already even here, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the face of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note023375"><a href="../bible/exo034.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;34:29</a></span> as we have formerly said, the body bears the stamp of the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For as the mordant of the dyeing process, remaining in the wool, produces in it a certain quality and diversity from other wool; so also in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the pain is gone, but the good remains; and the sweet is left, but the base is wiped away. For these are two qualities characteristic of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that which is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and that which is condemned.</p>

<p>And as in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, from his righteous conduct, and from his uninterrupted intercourse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who spoke to him, a kind of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> hue settled on his face; so also a divine power of goodness clinging to the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and in the exercise of the function of governing, impresses on it something, as it were, of intellectual radiance, like the solar ray, as a visible sign of righteousness, uniting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with light, through unbroken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is God-bearing and God-borne. Thence assimilation to God the Saviour arises to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as far as permitted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he being made perfect <q>as the Father who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023376"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;5:48</a></span> </p>

<p>It is He Himself who says, <q>Little children, a little while I am still with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023377"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;13:33</a></span> Since also God Himself remains blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, neither molested nor molesting another;  not in consequence of being by nature good, but in consequence of doing good in a manner peculiar to Himself. God being essentially, and proving Himself actually, both Father and good, continues immutably in the self-same goodness. For what is the use of good that does not act and do good?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Degrees of Glory in Heaven Corresponding with the Dignities of the Church Below</h2>

<p>He, then, who has first moderated his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and trained himself for impassibility, and developed to the beneficence of gnostic perfection, is here equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Luminous already, and like the sun shining in the exercise of beneficence, he speeds by righteous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God to the sacred abode, like as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Not that they became <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> through being chosen for some distinguished peculiarity  of nature, since also Judas was chosen along with them. But they were capable of becoming <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on being chosen by Him who foresees even ultimate issues. Matthias, accordingly, who was not chosen along with them, on showing himself worthy of becoming an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, is substituted for Judas.</p>

<p>Those, then, also now, who have exercised themselves in the Lord's commandments, and lived perfectly and gnostically according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, may be enrolled in the chosen body of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Such an one is in reality a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> minister (<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he do and teach what is the Lord's; not as being ordained  by men, nor regarded righteous because a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, but enrolled in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a>  because righteous. And although here upon earth he be not honoured with the chief seat,  he will sit down on the four-and-twenty thrones,  judging the people, as John says in the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the covenant of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, reaching down to us from the foundation of the world, through different generations and times, is one, though conceived as different in respect of gift. For it follows that there is one unchangeable gift of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> given by one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through one Lord, benefiting in many ways. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the middle wall  which separated the Greek from the Jew is taken away, in order that there might be a peculiar people. And so both meet in the one unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and the selection out of both is one. And the chosen of the chosen are those who by reason of perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are called [as the best] from the Church itself, and honoured with the most august <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash; the judges and rulers&mdash; four-and-twenty (the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> being doubled) equally from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks. Since, according to my opinion, the grades  here in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, are imitations of the angelic <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and of that economy which, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For these taken up in the clouds, the apostle <span class="stiki" id="note023386"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:17</a></span> writes, will first minister [as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>], then be classed in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a>, by promotion in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> differs <span class="stiki" id="note023387"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41</a></span> from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>) till they grow into <q>a perfect man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023388"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Degrees of Glory in Heaven</h2>

<p>Such, according to David, <q>rest in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> far on high, in which are gathered the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> indeed, who are pure in heart, in whom there is no guile;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023390"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47</a>; <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> who do not remain in the seventh seat, the place of rest, but are promoted, through the active beneficence of the divine likeness, to the heritage of beneficence which is the eighth grade; devoting themselves to the pure vision  of insatiable <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>

<p><q>And other sheep there are also,</q> says the Lord, <q>which are not of this fold</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023392"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;10:16</a></span> &mdash; deemed worthy of another fold and mansion, in proportion to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>But My sheep hear My voice,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023393"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;10:27</a></span> understanding gnostically the commandments. And this is to be taken in a magnanimous and worthy acceptation, along with also the recompense and accompaniment of works. So that when we hear, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you,</q>  we do not understand Him to say absolutely that those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in any way whatever shall be saved, unless also works follow. But it was to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone that He spoke this utterance, who kept the law and lived blamelessly, who wanted only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Lord. No one, then, can be a believer and at the same time be licentious; but though he quit the flesh, he must put off the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, so as to be capable of reaching his own mansion.</p>

<p>Now to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is more than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as to be dignified with the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> after being saved is a greater thing than being saved. Accordingly the believer, through great discipline, divesting himself of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, passes to the mansion which is better than the former one, viz., to the greatest torment, taking with him the characteristic of repentance from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He is tortured then still more&mdash; not yet or not quite attaining what he sees others to have acquired. Besides, he is also ashamed of his transgressions. The greatest torments, indeed, are assigned to the believer. For God's righteousness is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and His goodness is righteous. And though the punishments cease in the course of the completion of the expiation and purification of each one, yet those have very great and permanent grief who  are found worthy of the other fold, on account of not being along with those that have been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through righteousness.</p>

<p>For instance, Solomon, calling the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, wise, speaks thus of those who admire the dignity of his mansion: <q>For they shall see the end of the wise, and to what a degree the Lord has established him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023396"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse17">Wisdom&nbsp;4:17</a></span> And of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they will say, <q>This was he whom we once held up to derision, and made a byword of reproach; fools that we were! We thought his life <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and his end dishonourable. How is he reckoned among the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his inheritance among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023397"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse3">Wisdom&nbsp;5:3-5</a></span> </p>

<p>Not only then the believer, but even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, is judged most righteously. For since God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in virtue of His prescience that he would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, He nevertheless, in order that he might receive his own perfection gave him <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but gave it him previous to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And He gave the sun, and the moon, and the stars to be worshipped; <q>which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the Law says, <span class="stiki" id="note023398"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:19</a></span> made for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that they might not become altogether <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a>, and so utterly perish. But they, also in the instance of this commandment, having become devoid of sense, and addicting themselves to graven images, are judged unless they repent; some of them because, though able, they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and others because, though willing, they did not take the necessary pains to become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. There were also, however, those who, from the worship of the heavenly bodies, did not return to the Maker of them. For this was the sway given to the nations to rise up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by means of the worship of the heavenly bodies. But those who would not abide by those heavenly bodies assigned to them, but fell away from them to stocks and stones, <q>were counted,</q> it is said, <q>as chaff-dust and as a drop from a jar,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023399"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> beyond <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, cast away from the body.</p>

<p>As, then, to be simply saved is the result of medium  actions, but to be saved rightly and becomingly  is right action, so also all action of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> may be called right action; that of the simple believer, intermediate action, not yet perfected according to reason, not yet made right according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but that of every <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> again is sinful. For it is not simply doing well, but doing actions with a certain aim, and acting according to reason, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> exhibit as requisite. </p>

<p>As, then, lyres ought not to be touched by those who are destitute of skill in playing the lyre, nor flutes by those who are unskilled in flute-playing, neither are those to put their hand to affairs who have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to use them in the whole  of life.</p>

<p>The struggle for freedom, then, is waged not alone by the athletes of battles in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, but also in banquets, and in bed, and in the tribunals, by those who are anointed by the word, who are ashamed to become the captives of pleasures.</p>

<p><q>I would never part with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for unrighteous gain.</q> But plainly, unrighteous gain is pleasure and pain, toil and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and, to speak comprehensively, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the present of which is delightful, the future vexatious. <q>For what is the profit,</q> it is said, <q>if you gain the world and lose the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q>  It is clear, then, that those who do not perform good actions, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is for their own advantage. And if so, neither are they capable of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> aright, so as to receive from God <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; nor, should they receive them, will they be sensible of the boon; nor, should they enjoy them, will they enjoy worthily what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; both from their want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> how to use the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things given them, and from their excessive stupidity, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the way to avail themselves of the divine gifts.</p>

<p>Now stupidity is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And it appears to me that it is the vaunt of a boastful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, though of one with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to exclaim against what happens through circumstances:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Therefore let them do what they may;  <br>For it shall be well with me; and Right <br>Shall be my ally, and I shall not be caught doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But such a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> preserves <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> towards God and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards men; keeping the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pure with grave thoughts, and pure words, and just <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. By thus receiving the Lord's power, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> studies to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; regarding nothing bad but <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and action contrary to right reason. And giving thanks always for all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by righteous hearing and divine reading, by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> investigation, by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oblation, by blessed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; lauding, hymning, blessing, praising, such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is never at any time separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Rightly then is it said, <q>And they who trust in Him shall understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and those faithful in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shall abide by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023407"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse9">Wisdom&nbsp;3:9</a></span> You see what statements Wisdom makes about the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>.</p>

<p>Conformably, therefore, there are various abodes, according to the worth of those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.  To the point Solomon says, <q>For there shall be given to him the choice <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a more pleasant lot in the temple of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023409"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse14">Wisdom&nbsp;3:14</a></span> For the comparative shows that there are lower parts in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And the superlative remains to be conceived, where the Lord is. These chosen abodes, which are three, are indicated by the numbers in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; the thirty, the sixty, the hundred. <span class="stiki" id="note023410"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;13:8</a></span> And the perfect inheritance belongs to those who attain to <q>a perfect man,</q> according to the image of the Lord. And the likeness is not, as some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, that of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form; for this consideration is impious. Nor is the likeness to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that which consists in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For this utterance is also impious, being that of those who have imagined that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in man and in the sovereign God is the same. <q>You have supposed iniquity,</q> He says, <q>[in imagining] that I will be like to you.</q>  But <q>it is enough for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to become as the Master,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023412"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;25:10</a></span> says the Master. To the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, he that is introduced into adoption and the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the just inheritance of the lords and gods is brought; if he be perfected, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as the Lord Himself taught.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Different Degrees of Knowledge</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, is impressed with the closest likeness, that is, with the mind of the Master; which He being possessed of, commanded and recommended to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. Comprehending this, as He who taught wished, and receiving it in its grand sense, he teaches worthily <q>on the housetops</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023413"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;10:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;12:3</a></span> those capable of being built to a lofty height; and begins the doing of what is spoken, in accordance with the example of life. For He enjoined what is possible. And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the kingly man and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ought to be ruler and leader. For we are commanded to be lords over not only the wild beasts without us, but also over the wild <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> within ourselves.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then, as appears, of a bad and good life is the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> saved, understanding and executing <q>more than the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023414"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> <q>Exert yourself, and prosper, and reign</q> writes David, <q>because of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and meekness, and righteousness; and your right hand shall guide you marvellously,</q>  that is, the Lord. <q>Who then is the wise? And he shall understand these things. Prudent? And he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. For the ways of the Lord are right,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023416"><a href="../bible/hos014.htm#verse9">Hosea&nbsp;14:9</a></span> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, showing that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone is able to understand and explain the things spoken by the Spirit obscurely. <q>And he who understands in that time shall hold his peace,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023417"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse13">Amos&nbsp;5:13</a></span> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, plainly in the way of declaring them to the unworthy. For the Lord says, <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023418"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;11:15</a></span> declaring that hearing and understanding belong not to all. To the point David writes: <q>Dark water is in the clouds of the skies. At the gleam before Him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire;</q>  showing that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> words are hidden. He intimates that transparent and resplendent to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, like the innocuous hail, they are sent down from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that they are dark to the multitude, like extinguished coals out of the fire, which, unless kindled and set on fire, will not give forth fire or light. <q>The Lord, therefore,</q> it is said, <q>gives me the tongue of instruction, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in season when it is requisite to speak a word;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023420"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> not in the way of testimony alone, but also in the way of question and answer. <q>And the instruction of the Lord opens my mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023421"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;50:5</a></span> It is the prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to make use of speech, and when, and how, and to whom. And already the apostle, by saying, <q>After the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023422"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> makes the asseveration that the Hellenic teaching is elementary, and that of Christ perfect, as we have already intimated before.</p>

<p><q>Now the wild olive is inserted into the fatness of the olive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023423"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;12:17</a></span> and is indeed of the same species as the cultivated olives. For the graft uses as soil the tree in which it is engrafted. Now all the plants sprouted forth simultaneously in consequence of the divine order. Wherefore also, though the wild olive be wild, it crowns the Olympic victors. And the elm teaches the vine to be fruitful, by leading it up to a height. Now we see that wild trees attract more nutriment, because they cannot ripen. The wild trees, therefore, have less power of secretion than those that are cultivated. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their wildness is the want of the power of secretion. The engrafted olive accordingly receives more nutriment from its growing in the wild one; and it gets accustomed, as it were, to secrete the nutriment, becoming thus assimilated  to the fatness of the cultivated tree.</p>

<p>So also the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, resembling the wild olive, in having much that is undigested, on account of his devotion to the search, his propensity to follow, and his eagerness to seize the fatness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; if he get besides the divine power, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by being transplanted into the good and mild <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, like the wild olive, engrafted in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fair and merciful Word, he both assimilates the nutriment that is supplied, and becomes a fair and good olive tree. For engrafting makes worthless shoots noble, and compels the barren to be fruitful by the art of culture and by gnostic skill.</p>
<h3>Different modes of engrafting illustrative of different kinds of conversion.</h3>

<p>They say that engrafting is effected in four modes: one, that in which the graft must be fitted in between the wood and the bark; resembling the way in which we instruct plain people belonging to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who receive the word superficially. Another is, when the wood is cleft, and there is inserted in it the cultivated branch. And this applies to the case of those who have studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; for on cutting through their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is produced in them. So also in the case of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by opening up the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the new and noble plant of the olive is inserted. The third mode of engrafting applies to rustics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are brought by force to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For after smoothing off both suckers with a sharp pruning-hook, till the pith is laid bare, but not wounded, they are bound together. And the fourth is that form of engrafting called budding. For a bud (eye) is cut out of a trunk of a good sort, a circle being drawn round in the bark along with it, of the size of the palm. Then the trunk is stripped, to suit the eye, over an equal circumference. And so the graft is inserted, tied round, and daubed with clay, the bud being kept uninjured and unstained. This is the style of gnostic teaching, which is capable of looking into things themselves. This mode is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of most service in the case of cultivated trees. And <q>the engrafting into the good olive</q> mentioned by the apostle, may be [engrafting into] Christ Himself; the uncultivated and unbelieving nature being transplanted into Christ&mdash; that is, in the case of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But it is better [to understand it] of the engrafting  of each one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. For also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is thus somehow transplanted by distribution, according to the circumscribed capacity of each one, but without being circumscribed.</p>
<h3>Knowledge and love.</h3>

<p>Now, discoursing on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, Solomon speaks thus: <q>For wisdom is resplendent and fadeless, and is easily beheld by those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her. She is beforehand in making herself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who desire her. He that rises early for her shall not toil wearily. For to think about her is the perfection of good sense. And he that keeps <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> for her shall quickly be relieved of anxiety. For she goes about, herself seeking those worthy of her (for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs not to all); and in all ways she benignly shows herself to them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023426"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse12">Wisdom&nbsp;6:12-15</a></span> Now the paths are the conduct of life, and the variety that exists in the covenants. Presently he adds: <q>And in every thought she meets them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023427"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse16">Wisdom&nbsp;2:16</a></span> being variously contemplated, that is, by all discipline. Then he subjoins, adducing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which perfects by syllogistic reasoning and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> propositions, drawing thus a most convincing and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> inference, <q>For the beginning of her is the truest desire of instruction,</q> that is, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <q><a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of instruction, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the keeping of its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; and attention to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> is the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> causes nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The desire of wisdom leads, then, to the kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023428"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse17">Wisdom&nbsp;6:17-20</a></span> </p>

<p>For he teaches, as I think, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> instruction is desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and the practical exercise of instruction produces <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the keeping of the commandments which lead to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And the keeping of them is the establishment of the commandments, from which <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> results. <q>And <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> brings us near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
<h3>True knowledge found in the teaching of Christ alone.</h3>

<p>If, then, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> produces <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and leads the kingly man near to God the King, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ought to be sought till it is found. Now seeking is an effort at grasping, and finds the subject by means of certain signs. And discovery is the end and cessation of inquiry, which has now its object in its gasp. And this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And this discovery, properly so called, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is the apprehension of the object of search. And they say that a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is either the antecedent, or the coincident, or the consequent. The discovery, then, of what is sought respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the teaching through the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our Saviour being the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the prophecies which preceded His coming, announcing Him; and the testimonies regarding Him which attended His birth in the world; in addition, His powers proclaimed and openly shown after His ascension.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being with us, is the fact of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself having taught us. For if in every inquiry these universals are found, a person and a subject, that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is shown to be in our hands alone. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the person of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is exhibited; and the subject is the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which prevails over the opposition of every one whatever, and the assault of the whole world.</p>

<p>But since this is confessedly established by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> facts and reasons, and each one who thinks that there is no Providence has already been seen to deserve punishment and not contradiction, and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> an atheist, it is our aim to discover what doing, and in what manner living, we shall reach the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how, honouring the Divinity, we may become authors of our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> and learning, not from the Sophists, but from God Himself, what is well-pleasing to Him, we endeavour to do what is just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Now it is well-pleasing to Him that we should be saved; and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is effected through both well-doing and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of both of which the Lord is the teacher.</p>

<p>If, then, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, it is only possible to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> either from God or from the progeny of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with reason we, selecting testimonies from the divine oracles, boast of learning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, prophesied at first, and then explained.</p>
<h3>Philosophy and heresies, aids in discovering the truth.</h3>

<p>But the things which co-operate in the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are not to be rejected. Philosophy, accordingly, which proclaims a Providence, and the recompense of a life of felicity, and the punishment, on the other hand, of a life of misery, teaches theology comprehensively; but it does not preserve accuracy and particular points; for neither respecting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, nor respecting the economy of Providence, does it treat similarly with us; for it did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p> 

<p>Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, although they speak of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though they sing the praises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, speak without accuracy, not in accordance with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for they discover another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and receive Christ not as the prophecies deliver. But their false <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, while they oppose the conduct that is according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are against us. For instance, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, in order that those who had received their training from the law might not revolt from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through his breaking such points of the law as were understood more cam ally, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> right well that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> does not justify; for he professed that <q>all things were for all</q> by conformity, preserving those of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> that were essential, <q>that he might gain all.</q>  And Daniel, under the king of the Persians, wore <q>the chain,</q>  though he despised not the afflictions of the people.</p>

<p>The liars, then, in reality are not those who for the sake of the scheme of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> conform, nor those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in minute points, but those who are wrong in essentials, and reject the Lord, and as far as in them lies deprive the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teaching; who do not quote or deliver the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in a manner worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the Lord;  for the deposit rendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the teaching of the Lord by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, is the understanding and the practice of the godly tradition. <q>And what you hear in the ear</q>&mdash; that is, in a hidden manner, and in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> (for such things are figuratively said to be spoken in the ear)&mdash; <q>proclaim,</q> He says, <q>on the housetops,</q> understanding them sublimely, and delivering them in a lofty strain, and according to the canon of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> explaining the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; for neither <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> nor the Saviour Himself announced the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> simply so as to be easily apprehended by all and sundry, but express them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> accordingly say of the Lord, that <q>He spoke all things in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and without a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> spoke He nothing unto them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023432"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;13:34</a></span> and if <q>all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023433"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> consequently also <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the law were by Him, and were spoken by Him in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. <q>But all things are right,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note023434"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;8:9</a></span> <q>before those who understand,</q> that is, those who receive and observe, according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule, the exposition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> explained by Him; and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule is the concord and harmony of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the covenant delivered at the coming of the Lord. Knowledge is then followed by practical wisdom, and practical wisdom by self-control: for it may be said that practical wisdom is divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and exists in those who are deified; but that self-control is mortal, and subsists in those who philosophize, and are not yet wise. But if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is divine, so is also the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it; while self-control is a sort of imperfect wisdom which aspires after wisdom, and exerts itself laboriously, and is not contemplative. As certainly righteousness, being <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, is, as being a common thing, subordinate to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which subsists through the divine righteousness;  for the righteousness of the perfect man does not rest on civil contracts, or on the prohibition of law, but flows from his own spontaneous action and his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the meaning of Scripture being veiled.</h3>

<p>For many reasons, then, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> hide the sense. First, that we may become inquisitive, and be ever on the watch for the discovery of the words of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Then it was not suitable for all to understand, so that they might not receive harm in consequence of taking in another sense the things declared for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the prophecies are veiled in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>&mdash; preserved for chosen men, selected to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in consequence of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the style of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parabolic</a>. Wherefore also the Lord, who was not of the world, came as one who was of the world to men. For He was clothed with all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and it was His aim to lead man, the foster-child of the world, up to the objects of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and to the most essential truths by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from one world to another.</p>

<p>Wherefore also He employed metaphorical description; for such is the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>&mdash;a narration based on some subject which is not the principal subject, but similar to the principal subject, and leading him who understands to what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and principal thing; or, as some say, a mode of speech presenting with vigour, by means of other circumstances, what is the principal subject.</p>

<p>And now also the whole economy which prophesied of the Lord appears indeed a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when one speaks and the rest hear that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; of Him who made the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>&mdash; assumed flesh, and was conceived in the virgin's womb (as His material body was produced), and subsequently, as was the case, suffered and rose again, being <q>to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness,</q> as the apostle says.</p>

<p>But on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> being opened up, and declaring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to those who have ears, they proclaim the very suffering endured by the flesh, which the Lord assumed, to be <q>the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And finally, the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parabolic</a> style of Scripture being of the greatest antiquity, as we have shown, abounded most, as was to be expected, in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in order that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> might show that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks, and the wise men among the Barbarians besides, were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the future coming of the Lord, and of the mystic teaching that was to be delivered by Him. Rightly then, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, in proclaiming the Lord, in order not to seem to some to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> while speaking what was beyond the ideas of the multitude, embodied its declarations in expressions capable of leading to other conceptions. Now all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who foretold the Lord's coming, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> accompanying it, were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and killed. As also the Lord Himself, in explaining the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to them, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who preached the word like Him, and subsequently to His life, used <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>.  Whence also Peter, in his Preaching, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, says: <q>But we, unrolling the books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which we possess, who name <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, partly in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, partly in enigmas, partly expressly and in so many words, find His coming and death, and cross, and all the rest of the tortures which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> inflicted on Him, and His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and assumption to heaven previous to the capture  of Jerusalem. As it is written, <em>These things are all that He behooves to suffer, and what should be after Him.</em> Recognising them, therefore, we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God in consequence of what is written respecting Him.</q></p>

<p>And after a little again he draws the inference that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> owed their origin to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, asserting as follows: <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God enjoined these things, and we say nothing apart from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q></p>

<p>Now the Hebrew dialect, like all the rest, has certain properties, consisting in a mode of speech which exhibits the national character. Dialect is accordingly defined as a style of speech produced by the national character. But <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not marked by those dialects. For in the Hellenic writings, what are called changes of figures purposely produce onscurations, deduced after the style of our prophecies. But this is effected through the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> departure from direct speech which takes place in metrical or offhand diction. A figure, then, is a form of speech transferred from what is literal to what is not literal, for the sake of the composition, and on account of a diction useful in speech.</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not employ figurative forms in the expressions for the sake of beauty of diction. But from the fact that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> appertains not to all, it is veiled in manifold ways, causing the light to arise only on those who are initiated into <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The proverb, according to the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, is called a mode of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> is so called, and the enigma in addition. Further also, they are called <q>wisdom;</q> and again, as something different from it, <q>instruction and words of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>,</q> and <q>turnings of words,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness;</q> and again, <q>teaching to direct judgment,</q> and <q>subtlety to the simple,</q> which is the result of training, <q>and perception and thought,</q> with which the young catechumen is imbued. <span class="stiki" id="note023438"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;1:1-4</a></span> <q>He who hears these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, being wise, will be wiser. And the intelligent man will acquire rule, and will understand a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> and a dark saying, the words and enigmas of the wise.</q> </p>

<p>And if it was the case that the Hellenic dialects received their appellation from Hellen, the son of Zeus, surnamed Deucalion, from the chronology which we have already exhibited, it is comparatively easy to perceive by how many generations the dialects that obtained among the Greeks are posterior to the language of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>But as the work advances, we shall in each section, noting the figures of speech mentioned above by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,  exhibit the gnostic mode of life, showing it systematically according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Did not the Power also, that appeared to Hermas in the Vision, in the form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, give for transcription the book which she wished to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the elect? And this, he says, he transcribed to the letter, without finding how to complete the syllables.  And this signified that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is clear to all, when taken according to the bare reading; and that this is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which occupies the place of the rudiments. Wherefore also the figurative expression is employed, <q>reading according to the letter;</q> while we understand that the gnostic unfolding of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has already reached an advanced state, is likened to reading according to the syllables.</p>

<p>Further, Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is ordered to take <q>a new book, and write in it</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023442"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;8:1</a></span> certain things: the Spirit prophesying that through the exposition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> there would come afterwards the sacred <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which at that period was still unwritten, because not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For it was spoken from the beginning to those only who understand. Now that the Saviour has taught the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the unwritten rendering  of the written [Scripture] has been handed down also to us, inscribed by the power of God on hearts new, according to the renovation of the book. Thus those of highest repute among the Greeks, dedicate the fruit of the pomegranate to Hermes, who they say is speech, on account of its interpretation. For speech conceals much. Rightly, therefore, Jesus the son of Nave saw <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when taken up [to heaven], double&mdash;one <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and one on the mountains, honoured with burial in their ravines. And Jesus saw this spectacle below, being elevated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, along also with Caleb. But both do not see similarly. But the one descended with greater speed, as if the weight he carried was great; while the other, on descending after him, subsequently related the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which he beheld, being able to perceive more than the other as having grown purer; the narrative, in my opinion, showing that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the privilege of all. Since some look at the body of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, the expressions and the names as to the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; while others see through to the thoughts and what it is signified by the names, seeking the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that is with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>Many also of those who called to the Lord said, <q>Son of David, have mercy on me.</q>  A few, too, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; as Peter, whom also He pronounced blessed, <q>for flesh and blood revealed not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to him, but His Father in heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023445"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> &mdash; showing that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> recognises the Son of the Omnipotent, not by His flesh conceived in the womb, but by the Father's own power. That it is therefore not only to those who read simply that the acquisition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is so difficult, but that not even to those whose prerogative the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, is the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of it vouch-safed all at once, the history of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> teaches, until, accustomed to gaze, at the Hebrews on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on the visions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so we also become able to look the splendours of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the face.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Gnostic Exposition of the Decalogue</h2>

<p>Let the Decalogue be set forth cursorily by us as a specimen for gnostic exposition.</p>
<h3>The number <q>Ten.</q></h3>

<p>That ten is a sacred number, it is superfluous to say now. And if the tables that were written were the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will be found to exhibit physical creation. For by the <q>finger of God</q> is understood the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which the creation of heaven and earth is accomplished; of both of which the tables will be understood to be <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>. For the writing and handiwork of God put on the table is the creation of the world.</p>

<p>And the Decalogue, viewed as an image of heaven, embraces sun and moon, stars, clouds, light, wind, water, air, darkness, fire. This is the physical Decalogue of the heaven.</p>

<p>And the representation of the earth contains men, cattle, reptiles, wild beasts; and of the inhabitants of the water, fishes and whales; and again, of the winged tribes, those that are carnivorous, and those that use mild food; and of plants likewise, both fruit-bearing and barren. This is the physical Decalogue of the earth.</p>

<p>And the ark which held them  will then be the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things and wisdom. </p>

<p>And perhaps the two tables themselves may be the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the two covenants. They were accordingly <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> renewed, as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> along with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded. The commandments are written, then, doubly, as appears, for twofold spirits, the ruling and the subject. <q>For the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the Spirit against the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023448"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> </p>

<p>And there is a ten in man himself: the five senses, and the power of speech, and that of reproduction; and the eighth is the spiritual principle communicated at his creation; and the ninth the ruling faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and tenth, there is the distinctive characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which comes to him through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Besides, in addition to these ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> parts, the law appear to give its injunctions  to sight, and hearing, and smell, and touch, and taste, and to the organs subservient to these, which are double&mdash; the hands and the feet. For such is the formation of man. And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is introduced, and previous to it the ruling faculty, by which we reason, not produced in procreation; so that without it there is made up the number ten, of the faculties by which all the activity of man is carried out. For in order, straightway on man's entering <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, his life begins with sensations. We accordingly assert that rational and ruling power is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the constitution of the living creature; also that this, the irrational part, is animated, and is a part of it. Now the vital force, in which is comprehended the power of nutrition and growth, and generally of motion, is assigned to the carnal spirit, which has great susceptibility of motion, and passes in all directions through the senses and the rest of the body, and through the body is the primary subject of sensations. But the power of choice, in which investigation, and study, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, reside, belongs to the ruling faculty. But all the faculties are placed in relation to one&mdash; the ruling faculty: it is through that man lives, and lives in a certain way.</p>

<p>Through the corporeal spirit, then, man perceives, desires, rejoices, is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, is nourished, grows. It is by it, too, that thoughts and conceptions advance to actions. And when it masters the desires, the ruling faculty reigns.</p>

<p>The commandment, then, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q> says, you shall not serve the carnal spirit, but shall rule over it; <q>For the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023450"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and excites to disorderly conduct against nature; <q>and the Spirit against the flesh</q> exercises sway, in order that the conduct of the man may be according to nature.</p>

<p>Is not man, then, rightly said <q>to have been made in the image of God?</q>&mdash; not in the form of his [corporeal] structure; but inasmuch as God creates all things by the Word (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span>), and the man who has become a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> performs good actions by the faculty of reason (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FF7;</span>), properly therefore the two tables are also said to mean the commandments that were given to the twofold spirits,&mdash; those communicated before the law to that which was created, and to the ruling faculty; and the movements of the senses are both copied in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and manifested in the activity which proceeds from the body. For apprehension results from both combined. Again, as sensation is related to the world of sense, so is thought to that of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And actions are twofold&mdash; those of thought, those of act.</p>
<h3>The First Commandment.</h3>

<p>The first commandment of the Decalogue shows that there is one only Sovereign <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note023451"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;20:2-3</a></span> who led the people from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to their fatherland; that they might apprehend His power, as they were able, by means of the divine works, and withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, putting all their hope in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>
<h3>The Second Commandment.</h3>

<p>The second word  intimated that men ought not to take and confer the august power of God (which is the name, for this alone were many even yet capable of learning), and transfer His title to things created and vain, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> artificers have made, among which <q>He that is</q> is not ranked. For in His uncreated identity, <q>He that is</q> is absolutely alone.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Commandment.</h3>

<p>And the fourth  word is that which intimates that the world was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He gave us the seventh day as a rest, on account of the trouble that there is in life. For God is incapable of weariness, and suffering, and want. But we who bear flesh need rest. The seventh day, therefore, is proclaimed a rest&mdash; abstraction from ills&mdash; preparing for the Primal Day,  our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> rest; which, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the first creation of light, in which all things are viewed and possessed. From this day the first wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> illuminate us. For the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; a light <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, casting no shadow, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> indivisibly divided to all, who are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, holding the place of a luminary, in order to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of real existences. By following Him, therefore, through our whole life, we become impassible; and this is to rest. </p>

<p>Wherefore Solomon also says, that before heaven, and earth, and all existences, Wisdom had arisen in the Almighty; the participation of which&mdash; that which is by power, I mean, not that by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>&mdash; teaches a man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by apprehension things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Having reached this point, we must mention these things by the way; since the discourse has turned on the seventh and the eighth. For the eighth may possibly turn out to be properly the seventh, and the seventh manifestly the sixth, and the latter properly the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and the seventh a day of work. For the creation of the world was concluded in six days. For the motion of the sun from solstice to solstice is completed in six months&mdash; in the course of which, at one time the leaves fall, and at another plants bud and seeds come to maturity. And they say that the embryo is perfected exactly in the sixth month, that is, in one hundred and eighty days in addition to the two and a half, as Polybus the physician relates in his book <em>On the Eighth Month</em>, and Aristotle the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in his book <em>On Nature</em>. Hence the Pythagoreans, as I think, reckon six the perfect number, from the creation of the world, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and call it Meseuthys  and Marriage, from its being the middle of the even numbers, that is, of ten and two. For it is manifestly at an equal distance from both.</p>

<p>And as marriage generates from male and female, so six is generated from the odd number three, which is called the masculine number, and the even number two, which is considered the feminine. For twice three are six.</p>

<p>Such, again, is the number of the most general motions, according to which all origination takes place&mdash; up, down, to the right, to the left, forward, backward. Rightly, then, they reckon the number seven motherless and childless, interpreting the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and figuratively expressing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the rest, in which <q>they neither marry nor are given in marriage any more.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023457"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35</a></span> For neither by taking from one number and adding to another of those within ten is seven produced; nor when added to any number within the ten does it make up any of them.</p>

<p>And they called eight a cube, counting the fixed sphere along with the seven revolving ones, by which is produced <q>the great year,</q> as a kind of period of recompense of what has been promised.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord, who ascended the mountain, the fourth,  becomes the sixth, and is illuminated all round with spiritual light, by laying bare the power proceeding from Him, as far as those selected to see were able to behold it, by the Seventh, the Voice, proclaimed to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; in order that they, persuaded respecting Him, might have rest; while He by His birth, which was indicated by the sixth conspicuously marked, becoming the eighth, might appear to be God in a body of flesh, by displaying His power, being numbered indeed as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but being concealed as to who He was. For six is reckoned in the order of numbers, but the succession of the letters acknowledges the character which is not written. In this case, in the numbers themselves, each unit is preserved in its order up to seven and eight. But in the number of the characters, <em>Zeta</em> becomes six and <em>Eta </em>seven.</p>

<p>And the character  having somehow slipped into writing, should we follow it out thus, the seven became six, and the eight seven.</p>

<p>Wherefore also man is said to have been made on the sixth day, who became faithful to Him who is the sign (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x1FF3;</span> ), so as straightway to receive the rest of the Lord's inheritance. Some such thing also is indicated by the sixth hour in the scheme of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in which man was perfected. Further, of the eight, the intermediates are seven; and of the seven, the intervals are shown to be six. For that is another ground, in which seven glorifies eight, and <q>the heavens declare to the heavens the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>The sensible types of these, then, are the sounds we pronounce. Thus the Lord Himself is called <q>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023462"><a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;21:6</a></span> <q>by whom all things were made, and without whom not even one thing was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023463"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> God's resting is not, then, as some conceive, that God ceased from doing. For, being good, if He should ever cease from doing good, then would He cease from being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which it is sacrilege even to say. The resting is, therefore, the ordering that the order of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things should be preserved inviolate, and that each of the creatures should cease from the ancient disorder. For the creations on the different days followed in a most important succession; so that all things brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> might have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from priority, created together in thought, but not being of equal worth. Nor was the creation of each signified by the voice, inasmuch as the creative work is said to have made them at once. For something must needs have been named first. Wherefore those things were announced first, from which came those that were second, all things being originated together from one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by one power. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was one, in one identity. And how could creation take place in time, seeing time was born along with things which exist.</p>

<p>And now the whole world of creatures born alive, and things that grow, revolves in sevens. The <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> princes of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who have the greatest power, are seven.  The mathematicians also say that the planets, which perform their course around the earth, are seven; by which the Chaldeans think that all which concerns mortal life is effected through sympathy, in consequence of which they also undertake to tell things respecting the future.</p>

<p>And of the fixed stars, the Pleiades are seven. And the Bears, by the help of which agriculture and navigation are carried through, consist of seven stars. And in periods of seven days the moon undergoes its changes. In the first week she becomes half moon; in the second, full moon; and in the third, in her wane, again half moon; and in the fourth she disappears. Further, as Seleucus the mathematician lays down, she has seven phases. First, from being invisible she becomes crescent-shaped, then half moon, then gibbous and full; and in her wane again gibbous, and in like manner half moon and crescent-shaped.</p> <blockquote><p><q>On a seven-stringed lyre we shall sing new <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>writes a poet of note, teaching us that the ancient lyre was seven-toned. The organs of the senses situated on our face are also seven&mdash; two eyes, two passages of hearing, two nostrils, and the seventh the mouth.</p>

<p>And that the changes in the periods of life take place by sevens, the <em>Elegies of Solon</em> teach thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The child, while still an infant, in seven years, <br>Produces and puts forth its fence of teeth; <br>And when God seven years more completes, <br>He shows of puberty's approach the signs; <br>And in the third, the beard on growing cheek <br>With down o'erspreads the bloom of changing skin; <br>And in the fourth septenniad, at his best <br>In strength, of manliness he shows the signs; <br>And in the fifth, of marriage, now mature, <br>And of posterity, the man bethinks; <br>Nor does he yet desire vain works to see. <br>The seventh and eighth septenniads see him now <br>In mind and speech mature, till fifty years; <br>And in the ninth he still has vigour left, <br>But strength and body are for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> great <br>Less than of yore; when, seven years more, God brings <br>To end, then not too soon may he submit to die.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, in diseases the seventh day is that of the crisis; and the fourteenth, in which nature struggles against the causes of the diseases. And a myriad such instances are adduced by Hermippus of Berytus, in his book <em>On the Number Seven</em>, regarding it as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.  And the blessed David delivers clearly to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mystic account of seven and eight, praising thus: <q>Our years were exercised like a spider. The days of our years in them are seventy years; but if in strength, eighty years. And that will be to reign.</q>  That, then, we may be taught that the world was originated, and not suppose that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made it in time, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> adds: <q>This is the book of the generation: also of the things in them, when they were created in the day that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made heaven and earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023467"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;2:4</a></span> For the expression <q>when they were created</q> intimates an indefinite and dateless production. But the expression <q>in the day that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made,</q> that is, in and by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <q>all things,</q> and <q>without which not even one thing was made,</q> points out the activity exerted by the Son. As David says, <q>This is the day which the Lord has made; let us be glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it;</q>  that is, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  imparted by Him, let us celebrate the divine festival; for the Word that throws light on things hidden, and by whom each created thing came into life and being, is called day.</p>

<p>And, in fine, the Decalogue, by the letter <em>Iota</em>,  signifies the blessed name, presenting Jesus, who is the Word.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Commandment.</h3>

<p>Now the fifth in order is the command on the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of father and mother. And it clearly announces God as Father and Lord. Wherefore also it calls those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him sons and gods. The Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is their Lord and Father; and the mother is not, as some say, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from which we sprang, nor, as others teach, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom, as Solomon says, when he terms wisdom <q>the mother of the just,</q> and says that it is desirable for its own sake. And the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all, again, that is lovely and venerable, proceeds from God through the Son.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Commandment.</h3>

<p>Then follows the command about <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a sure destruction. He, then, that wishes to extirpate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, in order to introduce <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, alleging either that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is not under Providence, or that the world is uncreated, or affirming anything against <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, is most pernicious.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Commandment.</h3>

<p>This is followed by the command respecting <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, if one, abandoning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the persuasion respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, accedes to false and incongruous opinion, either by deifying any created object, or by making an idol of anything that exists not, so as to overstep, or rather step from, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> false opinion is foreign, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> belongs to him, and is allied with him. Wherefore the noble apostle calls one of the kinds of fornication, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>,  in following the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who says: <q>[My people] has committed fornication with stock and stone. They have said to the stock, You are my father; and to the stone, You have begotten me.</q> </p>
<h3>The Eighth Commandment.</h3>

<p>And after this is the command respecting theft. As, then, he that steals what is another's, doing great wrong, rightly incurs ills suitable to his deserts; so also does he, who arrogates to himself divine works by the art of the statuary or the painter, and pronounces himself to be the maker of animals and plants. Likewise those, too, who mimic the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are thieves. Whether one be a husbandman or the father of a child, he is an agent in depositing seeds. But it is God who, ministering the growth and perfection of all things, brings the things produced to what is in accordance with their nature. But the most, in common also with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, attribute growth and changes to the stars as the primary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, robbing the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as far as in them lies, of His tireless might.</p>

<p>The elements, however, and the stars&mdash; that is, the administrative powers&mdash; are ordained for the accomplishment of what is essential to the administration, and are influenced and moved by what is commanded to them, in the way in which the Word of the Lord leads, since it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the divine power to work all things secretly. He, accordingly, who alleges that he has conceived or made anything which pertains to creation, will suffer the punishment of his impious audacity.</p>
<h3>The Tenth Commandment. </h3>

<p>And the tenth is the command respecting all <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. As, then, he who entertains unbecoming desires is called to account; in the same way he is not allowed to desire things false, or to suppose that, of created objects, those that are animate have power of themselves, and that inanimate things can at all save or hurt. And should one say that an antidote cannot heal or hemlock kill, he is unwittingly deceived. For none of these operates except one makes use of the plant and the drug; just as the axe does not without one to cut with it, or a saw without one sawing with it. And as they do not work by themselves, but have certain physical qualities which accomplish their proper work by the exertion of the artisan; so also, by the universal <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through the medium of secondary causes, the operative power is propagated in succession to individual objects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Philosophy Conveys Only an Imperfect Knowledge of God</h2>

<p>But, as appears, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Greeks, while naming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. But their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations, according to Empedocles, <q>as passing over the tongue of the multitude, are poured out of mouths that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> little of the whole.</q> For as art changes the light of the sun into fire by passing it through a glass vessel full of water, so also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, catching a spark from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, is visible in a few. Also, as all animals breathe the same air, some in one way, others in another, and to a different purpose; so also a considerable number of people occupy themselves with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or rather with discourse concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For they do not say anything respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but expound Him by attributing their own affections to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they spend life in seeking the probable, not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not taught by imitation, but by instruction. For it is not that we may seem good  that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it is not alone for the purpose of being seen, while in the sun, that we pass into the sun. But in the one case for the purpose of being warmed; and in the other, we are compelled to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in order to be excellent and good. For the kingdom belongs pre-eminently to the violent,  who, from investigation, and study, and discipline, reap this fruit, that they become kings.</p>

<p>He, then, who imitates opinion shows also preconception. When then one, having got an inkling of the subject, kindles it within in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by desire and study, he sets everything in motion afterwards in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. For that which one does not apprehend, neither does he desire it, nor does he embrace the advantage flowing from it. Subsequently, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> at last imitates the Lord, as far as allowed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, having received a sort of quality akin to the Lord Himself, in order to assimilation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But those who are not proficient in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by rule. It is not therefore possible to share in the gnostic contemplations, unless we empty ourselves of our previous notions. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in regard to every object of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and of sense is thus simply universally declared. For instance, we may distinguish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of painting from that which is vulgar, and decorous music from licentious. There is, then, also a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as distinct from the other philosophies, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beauty as distinct from the spurious. It is not then the partial truths, of which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is predicated, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, that we are to investigate, not seeking to learn names. For what is to be investigated respecting God is not one thing, but ten thousand. There is a difference between declaring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and declaring things about God. And to speak generally, in everything the accidents are to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.</p>

<p>Suffice it for me to say, that the Lord of all is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I say the Lord of all absolutely, nothing being left by way of exception.</p>

<p>Since, then, the forms of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are two&mdash; the names and the things&mdash; some discourse of names, occupying themselves with the beauties of words: such are the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks. But we who are Barbarians have the things. Now it was not in vain that the Lord chose to make use of a mean form of body; so that no one praising the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and admiring the beauty might turn his back on what was said, and attending to what ought to be abandoned, might be cut off from what is intellectual. We must therefore occupy ourselves not with the expression, but the meaning.</p>

<p>To those, then, who are not gifted  with the power of apprehension, and are not inclined to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the word is not entrusted; since also the ravens imitate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voices, having no understanding of the thing which they say. And intellectual apprehension depends on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thus also Homer said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and gods,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not who the Father is, or how He is Father.</p>

<p>And as to him who has hands it is natural to grasp, and to him who has sound eyes to see the light; so it is the natural prerogative of him who has received <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to apprehend <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if he desires, on <q>the foundation</q> laid, to work, and build up <q>gold, silver, precious stones.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023478"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> </p>

<p>Accordingly he does not profess to wish to participate, but begins to do so. Nor does it belong to him to <em>intend</em>, but to <em>be </em>regal, and illuminated, and gnostic. Nor does it appertain to him to wish to grasp things in name, but in fact.</p>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being good, on account of the principal part of the whole creation, seeing He wishes to save it, was induced to make the rest also; conferring on them at the beginning this first boon, that of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For that to be is far better than not to be, will be admitted by every one. Then, according to the capabilities of their nature, each one was and is made, advancing to that which is better.</p>

<p>So there is no absurdity in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> having been given by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> as a preparatory discipline for the perfection which is by Christ; unless <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is ashamed at learning from Barbarian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> how to advance to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  But if <q>the very hairs are numbered, and the most insignificant motions,</q> how shall not <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> be taken into account? For to Samson power was given in his hair, in order that he might perceive that the worthless arts that refer to the things in this life, which lie and remain on the ground after the departure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, were not given without divine power.</p>

<p>But it is said Providence, from above, from what is of prime importance, as from the head, reaches to all, <q>as the ointment,</q> it is said, <q>which descends to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> beard, and to the skirt of his garment</q>  (that is, of the great High Priest, <q>by whom all things were made, and without whom not even one thing was made</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023481"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span>); not to the ornament of the body; for Philosophy is outside of the People, like raiment.  The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, therefore, who, trained to their own peculiar power of perception by the spirit of perception, when they investigate, not a part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> absolutely, testify to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a truth-loving and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> spirit; if in the case of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things said by those even who are of different sentiments they advance to understanding, through the divine administration, and the ineffable Goodness, which always, as far as possible, leads the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of existences to that which is better. Then, by cultivating the acquaintance not of Greeks alone, but also of Barbarians, from the exercise common to their proper intelligence, they are conducted to Faith. And when they have embraced the foundation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they receive in addition the power of advancing further to investigation. And thence they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to be learners, and aspiring after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, haste to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>Thus <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, that <q>the spirit of perception</q> was given to the artificers from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note023483"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;28:3</a></span> And this is nothing else than Understanding, a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, capable of studying existences,&mdash; of distinguishing and comparing what succeeds as like and unlike&mdash;of enjoining and forbidding, and of conjecturing the future. And it extends not to the arts alone, but even to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself.</p>

<p>Why, then, is the serpent called wise? Because even in its wiles there may be found a connection, and distinction, and combination, and conjecturing of the future. And so very many crimes are concealed; because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> arrange for themselves so as by all means to escape punishment.</p>

<p>And Wisdom being manifold, pervading the whole world, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, varies its appellation in each case. When it applies itself to first causes, it is called Understanding (<span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>). When, however, it confirms this by demonstrative reasoning, it is termed Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Science. When it is occupied in what pertains to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and receives without speculation the primal Word  in consequence of the maintenance of the operation in it, it is called Faith. In the sphere of things of sense, establishing that which appears as being truest, it is Right Opinion. In operations, again, performed by skill of hand, it is Art. But when, on the other hand, without the study of primary causes, by the observation of similarities, and by transposition, it makes any attempt or combination, it is called Experiment. But belonging to it, and supreme and essential, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which above all he who, in consequence of [divine] guidance, has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, receives after strong <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Philosophy, then, partaking of a more exquisite perception, as has been shown from the above statements, participates in Wisdom.</p>

<p>Logical discussion, then, of intellectual subjects, with selection and assent, is called Dialectics; which establishes, by demonstration, allegations respecting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and demolishes the doubts brought forward.</p>

<p>Those, then, who assert that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> did not come hither from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all but say that God does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each particular thing, and that He is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; if, indeed, each of these belongs to the class of individual things. But nothing that exists could have subsisted at all, had God not willed. And if He willed, then <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He having willed it to be such as it is, for the sake of those who not otherwise than by its means would abstain from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things&mdash; not those only which exist, but those also which shall be&mdash; and how each thing shall be. And foreseeing the particular movements, <q>He surveys all things, and hears all things,</q> seeing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> naked within; and possesses from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the idea of each thing individually. And what applies to theatres, and to the parts of each object, in looking at, looking round, and taking in the whole in one view, applies also to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in one glance He views all things together, and each thing by itself; but not all things, by way of primary intent.</p>

<p>Now, then, many things in life take their rise in some exercise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason, having received the kindling spark from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For instance, health by medicine, and soundness of body through gymnastics, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> by trade, have their origin and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in consequence of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> indeed, but in consequence, too, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> co-operation. Understanding also is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is especially <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of good men. Since many advantages are common to good and bad men: yet they are nevertheless advantageous only to men of goodness and probity, for whose sake God created them. For it was for the use of good men that the influence which is in God's gifts was originated. Besides, the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men are produced through the inspiration  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being disposed in the way it is, and the divine will being conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, particular divine ministers contributing to such services. For regiments of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distributed over the nations and cities.  And, perchance, some are assigned to individuals. </p>

<p>The Shepherd, then, cares for each of his sheep; and his closest inspection is given to those who are excellent in their natures, and are capable of being most useful. Such are those fit to lead and teach, in whom the action of Providence is conspicuously seen; whenever either by instruction, or government, or administration, God wishes to benefit. But He wishes at all times. Wherefore He moves those who are adapted to useful exertion in the things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and peace, and beneficence. But all that is characterized by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and leads back to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And it is given either in order that men may become good, or that those who are so may make use of their natural advantages. For it co-operates both in what is general and what is particular. How absurd, then, is it, to those who attribute disorder and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to make him the bestower of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> thing! For he is thus all but made more benignant to the Greeks, in respect of making men good, than the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> and mind.</p>

<p>Again, I reckon it is the part of law and of right reason to assign to each one what is appropriate to him, and belongs to him, and falls to him. For as the lyre is only for the harper, and the flute for the flute-player; so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are the possessions of good men. As the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the beneficent is to do good, as it is of the fire to warm, and the light to give light, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man will not do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or light produce darkness, or fire cold; so, again, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> cannot do anything <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. For its activity is to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as that of darkness to dim the eyes.</p>

<p>Philosophy is not, then, the product of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, since it makes men <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; it follows, then, that it is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose work it is solely to do good. And all things given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are given and received well.</p>

<p>Further, if the practice of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but was accorded to the best of the Greeks, it is clear also from what source it was bestowed&mdash; manifestly from Providence, which assigns to each what is befitting in accordance with his deserts. </p>

<p>Rightly, then, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> belonged the Law, and to the Greeks Philosophy, until the Advent; and after that came the universal calling to be a peculiar people of righteousness, through the teaching which flows from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, brought together by one Lord, the only God of both Greeks and Barbarians, or rather of the whole race of men. We have often called by the name <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that portion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> attained through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, although but partial. </p>

<p>Now, too what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the arts as arts,  have their beginning from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as the doing of anything artistically is embraced in the rules of art, so also acting sagaciously is classed under the head of sagacity (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>). Now sagacity is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and it is its function to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> other things, but much more especially what belongs to itself. And Wisdom (<span class="greek">&#x03A3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) being power, is nothing but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.</p>

<p>But <q>the earth is God's, and the fullness thereof,</q>  says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, teaching that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things come from God to men; it being through divine power and might that the distribution of them comes to the help of man.</p>

<p>Now the modes of all help and communication from one to another are three. One is, by attending to another, as the master of gymnastics, in training the boy. The second is, by assimilation, as in the case of one who exhorts another to benevolence by practising it before. The one co-operates with the learner, and the other benefits him who receives. The third mode is that by command, when the gymnastic master, no longer training the learner, nor showing in his own person the exercise for the boy to imitate, prescribes the exercise by name to him, as already proficient in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, accordingly, having received from God the power to be of service, benefits some by disciplining them, by bestowing attention on them; others, by exhorting them, by assimilation; and others, by training and teaching them, by command. And certainly he himself is equally benefited by the Lord. Thus, then, the benefit that comes from God to men becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the same time lending encouragement.  For by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whether seen or not, the divine power bestows <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Such was the mode adopted in the advent of the Lord. And sometimes also the power <q>breathes</q> in men's thoughts and reasonings, and <q>puts in</q> their hearts <q>strength</q> and a keener perception, and furnishes <q>prowess</q> and <q>boldness of alacrity</q>  both for researches and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>But exposed for imitation and assimilation are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> admirable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> examples of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the actions put on record. Further, the department of action is most conspicuous both in the testaments of the Lord, and in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in force among the Greeks, and also in the precepts of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>And to speak comprehensively, all benefit appertaining to life, in its highest reason, proceeding from the Sovereign <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father who is over all, is consummated by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who also on this account <q>is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>but especially of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023494"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:10</a></span> But in respect of its immediate reason, it is from those next to each, in accordance with the command and injunction of Him who is nearest the First Cause, that is, the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Use of Philosophy to the Gnostic</h2>

<h3>Greek philosophy the recreation of the Gnostic.</h3>

<p>Now our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> always occupies himself with the things of highest importance. But if at any time he has leisure and time for relaxation from what is of prime consequence, he applies himself to Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in preference to other recreation, feasting on it as a kind of dessert at supper.  Not that he neglects what is superior; but that he takes this in addition, as long as proper, for the reasons I mentioned above. But those who give their mind to the unnecessary and superfluous points of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and addict themselves to wrangling sophisms alone, abandon what is necessary and most essential, pursuing plainly the shadows of words.</p>

<p>It is well indeed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all. But the man whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is destitute of the ability to reach to acquaintance with many subjects of study, will select the principal and better subjects alone. For real science (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;</span>, which we affirm the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone possesses) is a sure comprehension (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C8;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>), leading up through <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sure reasons to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And he, who is acquainted with what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> respecting any one subject, becomes of course acquainted with what is false respecting it.</p>
<h3>Philosophy necessary.</h3>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it appears to me to be a proper point for discussion, Whether we ought to philosophize: for its terms are consistent.</p>

<p>But if we are not to philosophize, what then? (For no one can condemn a thing without first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it): the consequence, even in that case, is that we must philosophize. </p> 
<h3>First of all, idols are to be rejected.</h3>

<p>Such, then, being the case, the Greeks ought by the Law and the Prophets to learn to worship one God only, the only Sovereign; then to be taught by the apostle, <q>but to us an idol is nothing in the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023497"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:4</a></span> since nothing among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things can be a likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and further, to be taught that none of those images which they worship can be similitudes: for the race of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is not in form such as the Greeks fashion their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are invisible; not only those that are rational, but those also of the other animals. And their bodies never become parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> themselves, but organs&mdash; partly as seats, partly as vehicles&mdash; and in other cases possessions in various ways. But it is not possible to copy accurately even the likenesses of the organs; since, were it so, one might model the sun, as it is seen, and take the likeness of the rainbow in colours.</p>

<p>After abandoning <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, then, they will hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>Unless your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note023498"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a>; <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse8">James&nbsp;2:8</a></span> (who justified themselves in the way of abstinence from what was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>)&mdash;so as, along with such perfection as they evinced, and <q>the loving of your neighbour,</q> to be able also to do good, you shall not <q>be kingly.</q> </p>

<p>For intensification of the righteousness which is according to the law shows the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. So one who is placed in the head, which is that which rules its own body&mdash; and who advances to the summit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) itself, for which all the organs of perception exist&mdash; will likewise obtain the highest inheritance.</p>

<p>The primacy of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the apostle shows to those capable of reflection, in writing to those Greeks of Corinth, in the following terms: <q>But having hope, when your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is increased, that we shall be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly, to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> beyond you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023500"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:15-16</a></span> He does not mean the extension of his preaching locally: for he says also that in Achaia <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> abounded; and it is related also in the Acts of the Apostles that he preached the word in Athens. <span class="stiki" id="note023501"><a href="../bible/act017.htm">Acts&nbsp;17</a></span> But he teaches that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), which is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, goes beyond <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction, in accordance with the magnitude of the Lord's teaching and the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  Wherefore also he proceeds to add, <q>And if I am rude in speech, yet I am not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023503"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:6</a></span> </p>
<h3>Whence is the knowledge of truth?</h3>

<p>But let those who boast on account of having apprehended the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> tell us from whom they boast of having heard it. They will not say from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but will admit that it was from men. And if so, it is either from themselves that they have learned it lately, as some of them arrogantly boast, or from others like them. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teachers, speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not reliable, as men. For he that is man cannot speak worthily the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning God: the feeble and mortal [cannot speak worthily] of the Unoriginated and Incorruptible&mdash; the work, of the Workman. Then he who is incapable of speaking what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> respecting himself, is he not much less reliable in what concerns God? For just as far as man is inferior to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in power, so much feebler is man's speech than Him; although he do not declare <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only speak about God and the divine word. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech is by nature feeble, and incapable of uttering God. I do not say His name. For to name it is common, not to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> only, but also to poets. Nor [do I say] His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; for this is impossible, but the power and the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Those even who claim God as their teacher, with difficulty attain to a conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> aiding them to the attainment of their modicum of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; accustomed as they are to contemplate the will [of God] by the will, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <q>For the Spirit searches the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit.</q> </p>

<p>The only wisdom, therefore, is the God-taught wisdom we possess; on which depend all the sources of wisdom, which make conjectures at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>
<h3>Intimations of the Teacher's advent</h3>

<p>Assuredly of the coming of the Lord, who has taught us, to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there were a myriad indicators, heralds, preparers, precursors, from the beginning, from the foundation of the world, intimating beforehand by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, prophesying that He would come, and where, and how, what should be the signs. From afar certainly Law and Prophecy kept Him in view beforehand. And then the precursor pointed Him out as present. After whom the heralds point out by their teaching the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His manifestation.</p>
<h3>Universal diffusion of the Gospel a contrast to philosophy.</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, however, chose to [teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>] to the Greeks alone,  and not even to all of them; but Socrates to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to Xenocrates, Aristotle to Theophrastus, and Zeno to Cleanthes, who persuaded their own followers alone.</p>

<p>But the word of our Teacher remained not in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> alone, as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> did in Greece; but was diffused over the whole world, over every nation, and village, and town, bringing already over to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whole houses, and each individual of those who heard it by him himself, and not a few of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves.</p>

<p>And if any one ruler whatever prohibit the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, it vanishes immediately.  But our doctrine on its very first proclamation was prohibited by kings and tyrants together, as well as particular rulers and governors, with all their mercenaries, and in addition by innumerable men, warring against us, and endeavouring as far as they could to exterminate it. But it flourishes the more. For it dies not, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> doctrine dies, nor fades as a fragile gift. For no gift of God is fragile. But it remains unchecked, though prophesied as destined to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> to the end. Thus <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> writes of poetry: <q>A poet is a light and a sacred thing, and cannot write poetry till he be inspired and lose his senses.</q> And Democritus similarly: <q>Whatever things a poet writes with divine afflatus, and with a sacred spirit, are very beautiful.</q> And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what sort of things poets say. And shall no one be amazed at the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of God Almighty becoming the organs of the divine voice?</p>

<p>Having then moulded, as it were, a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, we have now shown who he is; indicating in outline, as it were, both the greatness and beauty of his character. What he is as to the study of physical phenomena shall be shown afterwards, when we begin to treat of the creation of the world.</p>
