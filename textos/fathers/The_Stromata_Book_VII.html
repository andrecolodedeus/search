<h1>The Stromata (Book VII)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Gnostic a True Worshipper of God, and Unjustly Calumniated by Unbelievers as an Atheist</h2>

<p>It is now time to show the Greeks that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>; so that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, learning of what description the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is, may condemn their own stupidity in rashly and inconsiderately <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the [<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>] name, and without reason calling those impious who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And clearer arguments must be employed, I reckon, with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, so that they may be able, from the exercise they have already had through their own training, to understand, although they have not yet shown themselves worthy to partake of the power of believing.</p>

<p>The prophetic sayings we shall not at present advert to, as we are to avail ourselves of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> subsequently at the proper places. But we shall point out summarily the points indicated by them, in our delineation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, so that by taking the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> at once (especially as they do not yet comprehend their utterances), we may not interrupt the continuity of the discourse. But after pointing out the things indicated, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> shall be shown in abundance to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>But if the assertions made by us appear to certain of the multitude to be different from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Lord, let it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that it is from that source that they have breath and life; and taking their rise from them, they profess to adduce the sense only, not the words. For further treatment, not being seasonable, will rightly appear superfluous. Thus, not to look at what is urgent would be excessively indolent and defective; and <q>blessed, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are they who, investigating the testimonies of the Lord, shall seek Him with their whole heart.</q>  And the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is, then, our purpose to prove that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and worships the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in a manner worthy of Him; and that worship meet for God is followed by loving and being loved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He accordingly judges all excellence to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> according to its worth; and judges that among the objects perceived by our senses, we are to esteem rulers, and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and every one advanced in years; and among subjects of instruction, the most ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and primeval <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and among intellectual ideas, what is oldest in origin, the timeless and unoriginated First Principle, and Beginning of existences&mdash; the Son&mdash; from whom we are to learn the remoter Cause, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the most ancient and the most beneficent of all; not capable of expression by the voice, but to be reverenced with reverence, and silence, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> wonder, and supremely venerated; declared by the Lord, as far as those who learned were capable of comprehending, and understood by those chosen by the Lord to acknowledge; <q>whose senses,</q> says the apostle, <q>were exercised.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023508"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span> </p>

<p>The service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, is his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> continual study  and occupation, bestowed on the Deity in ceaseless <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For of the service bestowed on men, one kind is that whose aim is improvement, the other ministerial. The improvement of the body is the object of the medical art, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Ministerial service is rendered to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> by children, to rulers by subjects.</p>

<p>Similarly, also, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the elders attend to the department which has improvement for its object; and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to the ministerial. In both these ministries the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the management of earthly affairs; and the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> himself ministers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and exhibits to men the scheme of improvement, in the way in which he has been appointed to discipline men for their amendment. For he is alone <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> that serves God rightly and unblameably in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. For as that treatment of plants is best through which their fruits are produced and gathered in, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and skill in husbandry, affording men the benefit accruing from them; so the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, taking to itself the fruits of the men who by his means have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, when not a few attain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and are saved by it, achieves by his skill the best harvest. And as Godliness (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>) is the habit which preserves what is becoming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the godly man is the only lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and such will he be who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is becoming, both in respect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of the life which must be lived by him, who is destined to be divine (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1FF7;</span>), and is already being assimilated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So then he is in the first place a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as he who honours his father is a lover of his father, so he who honours God is a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Thus also it appears to me that there are three effects of gnostic power: the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things; second, the performance of whatever the Word suggests; and the third, the capability of delivering, in a way suitable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the secrets veiled in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>He, then, who is persuaded that God is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, and has learned the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> from His only-begotten Son, how can he be an atheist (<span class="greek">&#x1F04;&#x03B8;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>)? Foa he is an atheist who thinks that God does not exist. And he is superstitious who dreads the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; who deifies all things, both wood and stone; and reduces to bondage spirit, and man who possesses the life of reason. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Son the Ruler and Saviour of All</h2>

<p>To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>  God is, then, the first step of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; then, through confidence in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, to consider the doing of wrong in any way as not suitable to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>So the best thing on earth is the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man; and the best thing in heaven, the nearer in place and purer, is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, the partaker of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and blessed life. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which is nearest to Him who is alone the Almighty One, is the most perfect, and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and most potent, and most princely, and most kingly, and most beneficent. This is the highest excellence, which orders all things in accordance with the Father's will, and holds the helm of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in the best way, with unwearied and tireless power, working all things in which it operates, keeping in view its hidden designs. For from His own point of view the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is never displaced; not being divided, not severed, not passing from place to place; being always everywhere, and being contained nowhere; complete <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the complete paternal light; all eyes, seeing all things, hearing all things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, by His power scrutinizing the powers. To Him is placed in subjection all the host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and gods; He, the paternal Word, exhibiting  a the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> administration for Him who put [all] in subjection to Him.</p>

<p>Wherefore also all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are His; some through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and others not yet so; and some as friends, some as faithful servants, some as servants merely. This is the Teacher, who trains the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> by <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and the believer by good hopes, and the hard of heart by corrective discipline through sensible operation. Thence His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is in private, in public, and everywhere.</p>

<p>And that He whom we call Saviour and Lord is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the prophetic Scriptures explicitly prove. So the Lord of all, of Greeks and of Barbarians, persuades those who are willing. For He does not compel him  who (through choosing and fulfilling, from Him, what pertains to laying hold of it the hope) is able to receive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from Him.</p>

<p>It is He who also gave <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to the Greeks by means of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For by an ancient and divine order the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distributed among the nations.  But the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is <q>the Lord's portion.</q> For either the Lord does not care for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and this is the case either because He is unable (which is not to be thought, for it would be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of weakness), or because He is unwilling, which is not the attribute of a good being. And He who for our sakes assumed flesh capable of suffering, is far from being luxuriously indolent. Or He does care for all, which is befitting for Him who has become Lord of all. For He is Saviour; not [the Saviour] of some, and of others not. But in proportion to the adaptation possessed by each, He has dispensed His beneficence both to Greeks and Barbarians, even to those of them that were <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, and in due time called, the faithful and elect. Nor can He who called all equally, and assigned special honours to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in a specially excellent way, ever <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> any. Nor can He who is the Lord of all, and serves above all the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the good and almighty Father, ever be hindered by another. But neither does <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> touch the Lord, who without beginning was impassible; nor are the things of men such as to be envied by the Lord. But it is another, he whom passion has touched, who envies. And it cannot be said that it is from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that the Lord is not willing to save humanity, because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how each one is to be cared for. For <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> applies not to the God who, before the foundation of the world, was the counsellor of the Father. For He was the Wisdom <q>in which</q> the Sovereign God <q>delighted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023516"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse30">Proverbs&nbsp;8:30</a></span> For the Son is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being the Father's most ancient Word before the production of all things, and His Wisdom. He is then properly called the Teacher of the beings formed by Him. Nor does He ever abandon care for men, by being drawn aside from pleasure, who, having assumed flesh, which by nature is susceptible of suffering, trained it to the condition of impassibility.</p>

<p>And how is He Saviour and Lord, if not the Saviour and Lord of all? But He is the Saviour of those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, because of their wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and the Lord of those who have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, till, being enabled to confess him, they obtain the peculiar and appropriate boon which comes by Him.</p>

<p>Now the energy of the Lord has a reference to the Almighty; and the Son is, so to speak, an energy of the Father. Therefore, a hater of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Saviour can never be; who, for His exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, despising not its susceptibility to suffering, but investing Himself with it, came for the common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men; for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who have chosen it, is common. Nay more, He will never neglect His own work, because man alone of all the other living creatures was in his creation endowed with a conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor can there be any other better and more suitable government for men than that which is appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>It is then always proper for the one who is superior by nature to be over the inferior, and for him who is capable of managing anything well to have the management of it assigned to him. Now that which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rules and presides is the Divine Word and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which inspects all things, and despises the care of nothing belonging to it.</p>

<p>Those, then, who choose to belong to Him, are those who are perfected through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Almighty Father, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, being the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of motion&mdash; a power incapable of being apprehended by sensation. For what He was, was not seen by those who, through the weakness of the flesh, were incapable of taking in [the reality]. But, having assumed sensitive flesh, He came to show man what was possible through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the commandments. Being, then, the Father's power, He easily prevails in what He wishes, leaving not even the minutest point of His administration unattended to. For otherwise the whole would not have been well executed by Him.</p>

<p>But, as I think, characteristic of the highest power is the accurate scrutiny of all the parts, reaching even to the minutest, terminating in the first Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, who by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father directs the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all; some overlooking, who are set under others, who are set over them, till you come to the great High Priest. For on one original first Principle, which acts according to the [Father's] will, the first and the second and the third depend. Then at the highest extremity of the visible world is the blessed band of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;  and down to ourselves there are ranged, some under others, those who, from One and by One, both are saved and save.</p>

<p>As, then, the minutest particle of steel is moved by the spirit of the Heraclean stone,  when diffused  over many steel rings; so also, attracted by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are added by affinity to the first abode, and the others in succession down to the last. But those who are bad from infirmity, having fallen from vicious insatiableness into a depraved state, neither controlling nor controlled, rush round and round, whirled about by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and fall down to the ground.</p>

<p>For this was the law from the first, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be the object of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> choice. Wherefore also the commandments, according to the Law, and before the Law, not given to the upright (for the law is not appointed for a righteous man <span class="stiki" id="note023520"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span>), ordained that he should receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and the blessed prize, who chose them.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, they allowed him who had been delighted with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to consort with the objects of his choice; and, on the other hand, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is ever improving in the acquisition  of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the increase of righteousness, should obtain a better place in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as tending in each step of advancement towards the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of impassibility, till <q>it come to a perfect man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023522"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> to the excellence at once of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of inheritance.</p>

<p>These salutary revolutions, in accordance with the order of change, are distinguished both by times, and places, and honours, and cognitions, and heritages, and ministries, according to the particular order of each change, up to the transcendent and continual <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the Lord in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>Now that which is lovable leads, to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of itself, each one who, from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, applies himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Wherefore also the Lord, drawing the commandments, both the first which He gave, and the second, from one fountain, neither allowed those who were before the law to be without law, nor permitted those who were unacquainted with the principles of the Barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to be without restraint. For, having furnished the one with the commandments, and the other with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, He shut up unbelief to the Advent. Whence  every one who believes not is without excuse. For by a different process of advancement, both Greek and Barbarian, He leads to the perfection which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<p>And if any one of the Greeks, passing over the preliminary training of the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, proceeds directly to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teaching, he distances others, though an unlettered man, by choosing  the compendious process of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to perfection.</p>

<p>Everything, then, which did not hinder a man's choice from being free, He made and rendered auxiliary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in order that there might be revealed somehow or other, even to those capable of seeing but dimly, the one only almighty, good God&mdash; from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> saving by His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>And, on the other hand, He is in no respect whatever the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For all things are arranged with a view to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, both generally and particularly. It is then the function of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to improve everything as far as practicable. For even minor matters are arranged with a view to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of that which is better, and for an abode suitable for people's character. Now everything that is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> changes for the better; having as the proper  <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of change the free choice of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has in its own power. But necessary corrections, through the goodness of the great overseeing Judge, both by the attendant <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and by various acts of anticipative judgment, and by the perfect judgment, compel egregious sinners to repent.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Gnostic Aims at the Nearest Likeness Possible to God and His Son</h2>

<p>Now I pass over other things in silence, glorifying the Lord. But I affirm that gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that surpass in the grandeur of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> the mode of life of each of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ranks, among whom the blessed abodes of the gods are allotted by distribution, reckoned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, transferred entire from among the entire, reaching places better than the better places, embracing the divine vision not in mirrors or by means of mirrors, but in the transcendently clear and absolutely pure insatiable vision which is the privilege of intensely loving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, holding festival through endless ages, remain honoured with the indentity of all excellence. Such is the vision attainable by <q>the pure in heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023527"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> This is the function of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who has been perfected, to have converse with God through the great High Priest, being made like the Lord, up to the measure of his capacity, in the whole service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which tends to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, through care of the beneficence which has us for its object; and on the other side through worship, through teaching and through beneficence in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> even forms and creates himself; and besides also, he, like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adorns those who hear him; assimilating as far as possible the moderation which, arising from practice, tends to impassibility, to Him who by nature possesses impassibility; and especially having uninterrupted converse and fellowship with the Lord. Mildness, I think, and philanthropy, and eminent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, are the rules of gnostic assimilation. I affirm that these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <q>are a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> acceptable in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023528"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> Scripture alleging that <q>the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart with right <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the holocaust of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  each man who is admitted to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> being illuminated in order to indissoluble union.</p>

<p>For <q>to bring themselves into captivity,</q> and to slay themselves, putting to death <q>the old man, who is through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> corrupt,</q> and raising the new man from death, <q>from the old conversation,</q> by abandoning the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and becoming free of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the apostle enjoin. </p>

<p>It was this, consequently, which the Law intimated, by ordering the sinner to be cut off, and translated from death to life, to the impassibility that is the result of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; which the teachers of the Law, not comprehending, inasmuch as they regarded the law as contentious, they have given a handle to those who attempt idly to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the Law. And for this reason we rightly do not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, needing nothing, supplies all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with all things; but we glorify Him who gave Himself in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for us, we also <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> ourselves; from that which needs nothing to that which needs nothing, and to that which is impassible from that which is impassible. For in our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> alone God delights. We do not therefore, and with reason too, offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him who is not overcome by pleasures, inasmuch as the fumes of the smoke stop far beneath, and do not even reach the thickest clouds; but those they reach are far from them. The Deity neither is, then, in want of anything, nor loves pleasure, or gain, or money, being full, and supplying all things to everything that has received being and has wants. And neither by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> nor offerings, nor on the other hand by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, is the Deity won over; nor is He influenced by any such things; but He appears only to excellent and good men, who will never betray <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for threatened <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor by the promise of considerable gifts.</p>

<p>But those who have not seen the self-determination of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and its incapability of being treated as a slave in what respects the choice of life, being disgusted at what is done through rude <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, do not think that there is a God. On a par with these in opinion, are they who, falling into licentiousness in pleasures, and grievous pains, and unlooked-for accidents, and bidding defiance to events, say that there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that, though existing, He does not oversee all things. And others there are, who are persuaded that those they reckon gods are capable of being prevailed upon by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and gifts, favouring, so to speak, their profligacies; and will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who exists in the invariableness of righteous goodness.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, who cares first for himself, then for his neighbours, that they may become very good. For the son gratifies a good father, by showing himself good and like his father; and in like manner the subject, the governor. For believing and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> are in our own power.</p>

<p>But should any one suppose the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to be the weakness of matter, and the involuntary impulses of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and (in his stupidity) irrational necessities; he who has become a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> has through instruction superiority over these, as if they were wild beasts; and in imitation of the divine plan, he does good to such as are willing, as far as he can. And if ever placed in authority, like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he will rule for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the governed; and will tame wildness and faithlessness, by recording <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for the most excellent, and punishment for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in accordance with reason for the sake of discipline.</p>

<p>For pre-eminently a divine image, resembling <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a righteous man; in which, through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the commands, as in a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> spot, is enclosed and enshrined the Leader of mortals and of immortals, King and Parent of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> law, and right, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Word, being the one Saviour individually to each, and in common to all.</p>

<p>He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Only-begotten, the express image of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the universal King and Almighty Father, who impresses on the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> the seal of the perfect <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, according to His own image; so that there is now a third divine image, made as far as possible like the Second Cause, the Essential Life, through which we live the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life; the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as we regard him, being described as moving amid things sure and wholly immutable.</p>

<p>Ruling, then, over himself and what belongs to him, and possessing a sure grasp, of divine science, he makes a genuine approach to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and apprehension of intellectual objects must necessarily be called certain scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whose function in reference to divine things is to consider what is the First Cause, and what that <q>by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023531"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and what things, on the other hand, are as pervasive, and what is comprehensive; what conjoined, what disjoined; and what is the position which each one of them holds, and what power and what service each contributes. And again, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, what man himself is, and what he has naturally or preternaturally; and how, again, it becomes him to do or to suffer; and what are his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and what his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; and about things good, bad, and indifferent; also about <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and self-restraint, and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is in all respects complete, namely, righteousness.</p>

<p>Further, he employs <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and righteousness in the acquisition of wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, not only in the endurance of circumstances, but also in restraining  pleasure and desire, grief and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and, in general, to withstand  everything which either by any force or fraud entices us. For it is not necessary to endure <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but it is to be persuaded to bear things that inspire <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, pain is found beneficial in the healing art, and in discipline, and in punishment; and by it men's manners are corrected to their advantage. Forms of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are endurance, magnanimity, high spirit, liberality, and grandeur. And for this reason he neither meets with the blame or the bad opinion of the multitude; nor is he subjected to opinions or flatteries. But in the indurance of toils and at the same time  in the discharge of any duty, and in his manly superiority to all circumstances, he appears <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a man (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C1;</span>) among the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings. And, on the other hand, maintaining <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, he exercises moderation in the calmness of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; receptive of what is commanded, as of what belongs to him, entertaining aversion to what is base, as alien to him; become decorous and supramundane,  he does everything with decorum and in order, and transgresses in no respect, and in nothing. Rich he is in the highest degree in desiring nothing, as having few wants; and being in the midst of abundance of all good through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the good. For it is the first effect of his righteousness, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to spend his time and associate with those of his own race both in earth and heaven. So also he is liberal of what he possesses. And being a lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he is a hater of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, entertaining a perfect aversion to all villany. He must consequently learn to be faithful both to himself and his neighbours, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the commandments. For he is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of God who spontaneously subjects himself to His commands. And he who already, not through the commandments, but through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself, is pure in heart, is the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For neither are we born by nature possessing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor after we are born does it grow naturally, as certain parts of the body; since then it would neither be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> nor praiseworthy. Nor is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, like speech, perfected by the practice that results from everyday occurrences (for this is very much the way in which <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> originates). For it is not by any art, either those of acquisition, or those which relate to the care of the body, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is attained. No more is it from the curriculum of instruction. For that is satisfied if it can only prepare and sharpen the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the state are perchance able to restrain bad actions; but persuasive words, which but touch the surface, cannot produce a scientific permanence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Now the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, as it were, purges the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and prepares it beforehand for the reception of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on which the Truth builds up the edifice of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> athlete&mdash; he who in the great stadium, the fair world, is crowned for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> victory over all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For He who prescribes the contest is the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He who awards the prize is the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Angels and gods are spectators; and the contest, embracing all the varied exercises, is <q>not against flesh and blood,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023536"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> but against the spiritual powers of inordinate <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that work through the flesh. He who obtains the mastery in these struggles, and overthrows the tempter, menacing, as it were, with certain contests, wins <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in most righteous judgment is infallible. The spectators  are summoned to the contest, and the athletes contend in the stadium; the one, who has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the directions of the trainer, wins the day. For to all, all rewards proposed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are equal; and He Himself is unimpeachable. And he who has power receives mercy, and he that has exercised will is mighty.</p>

<p>So also we have received <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we do. And the maxim <q>Know yourself</q> means here to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for what we are born. And we are born to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandments, if we choose to be willing to be saved. Such is the Nemesis,  through which there is no escaping from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Man's duty, then, is <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has proclaimed <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> manifold by the commandments. And confession is thanksgiving. For the beneficent first begins to do good. And he who on fitting considerations readily receives and keeps the commandments, is faithful (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>); and he who by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> requites benefits as far as he is able, is already a friend. One recompense on the part of men is of paramount importance&mdash; the doing of what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As being His own production, and a result akin to Himself, the Teacher and Saviour receives acts of assistance and of improvement on the part of men as a personal favour and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; as also He regards the injuries inflicted on those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as ingratitude and dishonour to Himself. For what other dishonour can touch God? Wherefore it is impossible to render a recompense at all equivalent to the boon received from the Lord.</p>

<p>And as those who maltreat property insult the owners, and those who maltreat soldiers insult the commander, so also the ill-usage of His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ones is contempt for the Lord.</p>

<p>For, just as the sun not only illumines heaven and the whole world, shining over land and sea, but also through windows and small chinks sends his beams into the innermost recesses of houses, so the Word diffused everywhere casts His eye-glance on the minutest circumstances of the actions of life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Heathens Made Gods Like Themselves, Whence Springs All Superstition</h2>

<p>Now, as the Greeks represent the gods as possessing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> forms, so also do they as possessing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. And as each of them depict their forms similar to themselves, as Xenophanes says, <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> as black and apes, the Thracians ruddy and tawny;</q> so also they assimilate their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to those who form them: the Barbarians, for instance, who make them savage and wild; and the Greeks, who make them more civilized, yet subject to passion.</p>

<p>Wherefore it stands to reason, that the ideas entertained of God by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men must be bad, and those by good men most excellent. And therefore he who is in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> kingly and gnostic, being likewise <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and free from <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, is persuaded that He who alone is God is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, venerable, august, beneficent, the doer of good, the author of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And respecting the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> we have, as I think, shown enough in the book entitled by us <em>The Exhortation</em>, availing ourselves abundantly of the history bearing on the point. There is no need, then, again to make a long story of what has already been clearly stated. But in as far as necessity requires to be pointed out on coming to the topic, suffice it to adduce a few out of many considerations in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the impiety of those who make the Divinity resemble the worst men. For either those Gods of theirs are injured by men, and are shown to be inferior to men on being injured by us; or, if not so, how is it that they are incensed at those by whom they are not injured, like a testy old wife roused to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?</p>

<p>As they say that Artemis was enraged at the &AElig;tolians on account of &OElig;neus.  For how, being a goddess, did she not consider that he had neglected to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, not through contempt, but out of inadvertence, or under the idea that he had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>?</p>

<p>And Latona,  arguing her case with Athene, on account of the latter being incensed at her for having brought forth in the temple, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Man-slaying spoils <br>Torn from the dead you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to see. And these <br>To you are not unclean. But you regard <br>My parturition here a horrid thing, <br>Though other creatures in the temple do <br>No harm by bringing forth their young.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>It is natural, then, that having a superstitious dread of those irascible [gods], they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that all events are signs and causes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. If a mouse bore through an altar built of clay, and for want of something else gnaw through an oil flask; if a cock that is being fattened crow in the evening, they determine this to be a sign of something.</p>

<p>Of such a one Menander gives a comic description in <em>The Superstitious Man:</em>&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q> <em>A.</em> Good luck be mine, you honoured gods! <br>Tying my, right shoe's string, <br>I broke it.</q> <br><q> <em>B.</em> Most likely, silly fool, <br>For it was rotten, and you, niggard, you <br>Would not buy new ones.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>It was a clever remark of Antiphon, who (when one regarded it as an ill omen that the sow had eaten her pigs), on seeing her emaciated through the niggardliness of the person that kept her, said, Congratulate yourself on the omen that, being so hungry, she did not eat your own children.</p>

<p><q>And what wonder is it,</q> says Bion, <q>if the mouse, finding nothing to eat, gnaws the bag?</q> For it were wonderful if (as Arcesilaus argued in fun) <q>the bag had eaten the mouse.</q></p>

<p>Diogenes accordingly remarked well to one who wondered at finding a serpent coiled round a pestle: <q>Don't wonder; for it would have been more surprising if you had seen the pestle coiled round the serpent, and the serpent straight.</q></p>

<p>For the irrational creatures must run, and scamper, and fight, and breed, and die; and these things being natural to them, can never be unnatural to us.</p> <blockquote><p><q>And many birds beneath the sunbeams walk.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the comic poet Philemon treats such points in comedy:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>When I see one who watches who has sneezed, <br>Or who has spoke; or looking, who goes on, <br>I straightway in the market sell him off. <br>Each one of us walks, talks, and sneezes too, <br>For his own self, not for the citizens: <br>According to their nature things turn out.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then by the practice of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> men seek health: and by cramming themselves, and wallowing in potations at feasts, they attract diseases.</p>

<p>There are many, too, that dread inscriptions set up. Very cleverly Diogenes, on finding in the house of a bad man the inscription, <q>Hercules, for victory famed, dwells here; let nothing bad enter,</q> remarked, <q>And how shall the master of the house go in?</q></p>

<p>The same people, who worship every stick and greasy stone, as the saying is, dreads tufts of tawny wool, and lumps of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and torches, and squills, and sulphur, bewitched by sorcerers, in certain impure <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of expiation. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, recognises as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> only the character of the righteous man&mdash;as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, wrong and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>You may see the eggs,  taken from those who have been purified, hatched if subjected to the necessary warmth. But this could not take place if they had had transferred to them the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the man that had undergone purification. Accordingly the comic poet Diphilus facetiously writes, in comedy, of sorcerers, in the following words:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Purifying Pr&oelig;tus' daughters, and their father <br>Pr&oelig;tus Abantades, and fifth, an old wife to boot, <br>So many people's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with one torch, one squill, <br>With sulphur and asphalt of the loud-sounding sea, <br>From the placid-flowing, deep-flowing ocean. <br>But blest air through the clouds send Anticyra <br>That I may make this bug into a drone.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For well Menander remarks: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Had you, O Phidias, any real ill, <br>You needs must seek for it a real cure; <br>Now 'tis not so. And for the unreal ill <br>I've found an unreal cure. Believe that it <br>Will do you good. Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in a ring <br>Wipe you, and from three fountains water bring. <br>Add <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> and lentils; sprinkle then yourself. <br>Each one is pure, who's conscious of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For instance, the tragedy says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p> <em>Menelaus</em>. <q>What disease, Orestes, is destroying you?</q> <br> <em>Orestes</em>. <q>Conscience. For horrid <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I've done.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>For in reality there is no other purity but abstinence from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Excellently then Epicharmus says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If a pure mind you have, <br>In your whole body you are pure.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Now also we say that it is requisite to purify the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from corrupt and bad doctrines by right reason; and so thereafter to the recollection of the principal heads of doctrine. Since also before the communication of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> they think it right to apply certain purifications to those who are to be initiated; so it is requisite for men to abandon impious opinion, and thus turn to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tradition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Holy Soul a More Excellent Temple Than Any Edifice Built by Man</h2>

<p>For is it not the case that rightly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> we do not circumscribe in any place that which cannot be circumscribed; nor do we shut up in temples made with hands that which contains all things? What work of builders, and stonecutters, and mechanical art can be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? Superior to these are not they who think that the air, and the enclosing space, or rather the whole world and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, are meet for the excellency of God?</p>

<p>It were indeed ridiculous, as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves say, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the plaything  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the plaything  of art; since what is made is similar and the same to that of which it is made, as that which is made of ivory is ivory, and that which is made of gold golden. Now the images and temples constructed by mechanics are made of inert matter; so that they too are inert, and material, and profane; and if you perfect the art, they partake of mechanical coarseness. Works of art cannot then be sacred and divine.</p>

<p>And what can be localized, there being nothing that is not localized? Since all things are in a place. And that which is localized having been formerly not localized, is localized by something. If, then, God is localized by men, He was once not localized, and did not exist at all. For the non-existent is what is not localized; since whatever does not exist is not localized. And what exists cannot be localized by what does not exist; nor by another entity. For it is also an entity. It follows that it must be by itself. And how shall anything generate itself? Or how shall that which exists place itself as to being? Whether, being formerly not localized, has it localized itself? But it was not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; since what exists not is not localized. And its localization being supposed, how can it afterwards make itself what it previously was?</p>

<p>But how can He, to whom the things that are belong, need anything? But were God possessed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, He would need, equally with man, food, and shelter, and house, and the attendant incidents. Those who are like in form and affections will require similar sustenance. And if sacred (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03BF; &#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>) has a twofold application, designating both God Himself and the structure raised to His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>,  how shall we not with propriety call the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, made for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sacred (<span class="greek">&#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>) to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of great value, and not constructed by mechanical art, nor embellished by the hand of an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God fashioned into a temple? For it is not now the place, but the assemblage of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>,  that I call the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This temple is better for the reception of the greatness of the dignity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the living creature which is of high value, is made sacred by that which is worth all, or rather which has no equivalent, in virtue of the exceeding <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the latter. Now this is the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who is of great value, who is honoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom God is enshrined, that is, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> respecting God is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Here, too, we shall find the divine likeness and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> image in the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in being purified and performing blessed <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Here also we shall find that which is localized, and that which is being localized,&mdash; the former in the case of those who are already <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and the latter in the case of those capable of becoming so, although not yet worthy of receiving the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For every being destined to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is already faithful in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and set up for His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, an image, endowed with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Prayers and Praise from a Pure Mind, Ceaselessly Offered, Far Better Than Sacrifices</h2>

<p>As, then, God is not circumscribed by place, neither is ever represented by the form of a living creature; so neither has He similar <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, nor has He wants like the creatures, so as to desire <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, from hunger, by way of food. Those creatures which are affected by passion are all mortal. And it is useless to bring food to one who is not nourished.</p>

<p>And that comic poet Pherecrates, in <em>The Fugitives</em>, facetiously represents the gods themselves as finding fault with men on the score of their sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>When to the gods you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <br>Selecting what our portion is, <br>'Tis shame to tell, do not take, <br>And both the thighs, clean to the groins, <br>The loins quite bare, the backbone, too, <br>Clean scrape as with a file, <br>Them swallow, and the remnant give <br>To us as if to dogs? And then, <br>As if of one another 'shamed, <br>With heaps of salted barley hide.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And Eubulus, also a comic poet, thus writes respecting <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But to the gods the tail alone <br>And thigh, as if to pederasts you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And introducing Dionysus in Semele, he represents him disputing:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>First if they offer anything to me, there are <br>Who offer blood, the bladder, not the heart <br>Or caul. For I no flesh do ever eat <br>That's sweeter than the thigh.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And Menander writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The end of the loin, <br>The bile, the bones uneatable, they set <br>Before the gods; the rest themselves consume.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>For is not the savour of the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> avoided by the beasts? And if in reality the savour is the reward of the gods of the Greeks, should they not first deify the cooks, who are dignified with equal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and worship the chimney itself, which is closer still to the much-prized savour?</p>

<p>And Hesiod says that Zeus, cheated in a division of flesh by Prometheus, received the white bones of an ox, concealed with cunning art, in shining fat:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Whence to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods the tribes of men <br>The victim's white bones on the altars burn.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But they will by no means say that the Deity, enfeebled through the desire that springs from want, is nourished. Accordingly, they will represent Him as nourished without desire like a plant, and like beasts that burrow. They say that these grow innoxiously, nourished either by the density in the air, or from the exhalations proceeding from their own body. Though if the Deity, though needing nothing, is according to them nourished, what necessity has He for food, wanting nothing? But if, by nature needing nothing, He delights to be honoured, it is not without reason that we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and thus the best and holiest <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with righteousness we bring, presenting it as an offering to the most righteous Word, by whom we receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by Him for what  we have learned.</p>

<p>The altar, then, that is with us here, the terrestrial one, is the congregation of those who devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, having as it were one common voice and one mind.</p>

<p>Now, if nourishing substances taken in by the nostrils are diviner than those taken in by the mouth, yet they infer respiration. What, then, do they say of God? Whether does He exhale like the tribe of oaks?  Or does He only inhale, like the aquatic animals, by the dilatation of their gills? Or does He breathe all round, like the insects, by the compression of the section by means of their wings? But no one, if he is in his senses, will liken God to any of these.</p>

<p>And the creatures that breathe by the expansion of the lung towards the thorax draw in the air. Then if they assign to God viscera, and arteries, and veins, and nerves, and parts, they will make Him in nothing different from man.</p>

<p>Now breathing together (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>)  is properly said of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the word breathing as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>  from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and the whole mind being at the same time unveiled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the very ancient altar in Delos they celebrated as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; which alone, being undefiled by slaughter and death, they say Pythagoras approached. And will they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us when we say that the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred altar, and that <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> arising from it is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? But I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were invented by men to be a pretext for eating flesh.  But without such <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> he who wished might have partaken of flesh.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the Law express figuratively the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which we practice, as the turtle-dove and the pigeon offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> point out that the cleansing of the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one of the righteous does not burden his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the eating of flesh, he has the advantage of a rational reason, not as Pythagoras and his followers dream of the transmigration of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Now Xenocrates, treating by himself of <q>the food derived from animals,</q> and Polemon in his work <em>On Life according to Nature</em>, seem clearly to say that animal food is unwholesome, inasmuch as it has already been elaborated and assimilated to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the irrational creatures.</p>

<p>So also, in particular, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> abstain from swine's flesh on the ground of this animal being unclean; since more than the other animals it roots up, and destroys the productions of the ground. But if they say that the animals were assigned to men&mdash; and we agree with them&mdash; yet it was not entirely for food. Nor was it all animals, but such as do not work. Wherefore the comic poet <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says not badly in the drama of <em>The Feasts:</em> &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For of the quadrupeds we should not slay <br>In future anything but swine. For these have flesh <br>Most toothsome; and about the pig is nought <br>For us, excepting bristles, mud, and noise.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Whence &AElig;sop said not badly, that <q>swine squeaked out very loudly, because, when they were dragged, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were good for nothing but for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q></p>

<p>Wherefore also Cleanthes says, <q>that they have <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  instead of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>,</q> that their flesh may not putrefy. Some, then, eat them as useless, others as destructive of fruits. And others do not eat them, because the animal has a strong sensual propensity.</p>

<p>So, then, the law <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not the goat, except in the sole case of the banishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;  since pleasure is the metropolis of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. It is to the point also that it is said that the eating of goat's flesh contributes to epilepsy. And they say that the greatest increase is produced by swine's flesh. Wherefore it is beneficial to those who exercise the body; but to those who devote themselves to the development of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it is not so, on account of the hebetude that results from the eating of flesh. Perchance also some <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will abstain from the eating of flesh for the sake of training, and in order that the flesh may not grow wanton in amorousness. <q>For wine,</q> says Androcydes, <q>and gluttonous feeds of flesh make the body strong, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more sluggish.</q> Accordingly such food, in order to clear understanding, is to be rejected.</p>

<p>Wherefore also the Egyptians, in the purifications practiced among them, do not allow the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to feed on flesh; but they use chickens, as lightest; and they do not touch fish, on account of certain fables, but especially on account of such food making the flesh flabby. But now terrestrial animals and birds breathe the same air as our vital spirits, being possessed of a vital principle cognate with the air. But it is said that fishes do not breathe this air, but that which was mixed with the water at the instant of its first creation, as well as with the rest of the elements, which is also a sign of the permanence of matter. </p>

<p>Wherefore we ought to offer to God <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not costly, but such as He loves. And that compounded <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> which is mentioned in the Law, is that which consists of many tongues and voices in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  or rather of different nations and natures, prepared by the gift vouchsafed in the dispensation for <q>the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> and brought together in praises, with a pure <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and just and right conduct, from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> works and righteous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For in the elegant language of poetry&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Who is so great a fool, and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <br>So very easy of belief, as thinks <br>The gods, with fraud of fleshless bones and bile <br>All burnt, not fit for hungry dogs to eat, <br>Delighted are, and take this as their prize, <br>And favour show to those who treat them thus,</q></p></blockquote>

<p>though they happen to be tyrants and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>?</p>

<p>But we say that the fire sanctifies  not flesh, but sinful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; meaning not the all-devouring vulgar fire  but that of wisdom, which pervades the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> passing through the fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. What Sort of Prayer the Gnostic Employs, and How It is Heard by God</h2>

<p>Now we are commanded to reverence and to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the same one, being persuaded that He is Word, Saviour, and Leader, and by Him, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not on special days, as some others, but doing this continually in our whole life, and in every way. Certainly the elect race justified by the precept says, <q>Seven times a day have I praised You.</q>  Whence not in a specified place,  or selected temple, or at certain festivals and on appointed days, but during his whole life, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> in every place, even if he be alone by himself, and wherever he has any of those who have exercised the like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, honours <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, acknowledges his gratitude for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the way to live.</p>

<p>And if the presence of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, through the respect and reverence which he inspires, always improves him with whom he associates, with much more reason does not he who always holds uninterrupted converse with God by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, life, and thanksgiving, grow at every step superior to himself in all respects&mdash; in conduct, in words, in disposition? Such an one is persuaded that God is ever beside him, and does not suppose that He is confined in certain limited places; so that under the idea that at times he is without Him, he may indulge in excesses night and day.</p>

<p>Holding festival, then, in our whole life, persuaded that God is altogether on every side present, we cultivate our fields, praising; we sail the sea, hymning; in all the rest of our conversation we conduct ourselves according to rule.  The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, is very closely allied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being at once grave and cheerful in all things&mdash;grave on account of the bent of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards the Divinity, and cheerful on account of his consideration of the blessings of humanity which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given us.</p>

<p>Now the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is evidently presented by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> when he says, <q>Benignity, and instruction, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> teach me,</q>  magnifying the supremacy of perfection by a climax.</p>

<p>He is, then, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> kingly man; he is the sacred <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is even now observed among the most sagacious of the Barbarians, in advancing the sacerdotal caste to the royal power. He, therefore, never surrenders himself to the rabble that rules supreme over the theatres, and gives no admittance even in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> to the things which are spoken, done, and seen for the sake of alluring pleasures; neither, therefore, to the pleasures of sight, nor the various pleasures which are found in other enjoyments, as costly <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and odours, which bewitch the nostrils, or preparations of meats, and indulgences in different wines, which ensnare the palate, or fragrant bouquets of many flowers, which through the senses effeminate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But always tracing up to God the grave enjoyment of all things, he offers the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of food, and drink, and ointments to the Giver of all, acknowledging his thanks in the gift and in the use of them by the Word given to him. He rarely goes to convivial banquets of all and sundry, unless the announcement to him of the friendly and harmonious character of the entertainment induce him to go. For he is convinced that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and perceives all things&mdash; not the words only, but also the thought; since even our sense of hearing, which acts through the passages of the body, has the apprehension [belonging to it] not through corporeal power, but through a psychical perception, and the intelligence which distinguishes significant sounds. God is not, then, possessed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, so as to hear; nor needs He senses, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> have decided, <q>especially hearing and sight; for He could never otherwise apprehend.</q> But the susceptibility of the air, and the intensely keen perception of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  and the power which reaches the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> consciousness, by ineffable power and without sensible hearing, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things at the moment of thought. And should any one say that the voice does not reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is rolled downwards in the air, yet the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cleave not the air only, but the whole world. And the divine power, with the speed of light, sees through the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Well! Do not also volitions speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, uttering their voice? And are they not conveyed by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? And what voice shall He wait for, who, according to His purpose, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the elect already, even before his birth, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is to be as already existent? Does not the light of power shine down to the very bottom of the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <q>the lamp of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, searching <q>the recesses</q>? God is all ear and all eye, if we may be permitted to use these expressions.</p>

<p>In general, then, an unworthy opinion of God preserves no <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, either in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or discourses, or writings, or <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, but diverts to grovelling and unseemly ideas and notions. Whence the commendation of the multitude differs nothing from censure, in consequence of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The objects, then, of desires and aspirations, and, in a word, of the mind's impulses, are the subjects of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Wherefore, no man desires a draught, but to drink what is drinkable; and no man desires an inheritance, but to inherit. And in like manner no man desires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; or a right government, but to take part in the government. The subjects of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, then, are the subjects of our requests, and the subjects of requests are the objects of desires. Prayer, then, and desire, follow in order, with the view of possessing the blessings and advantages offered.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, who is such by possession, makes his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and request for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which appertain to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, he himself also contributing his efforts to attain to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of goodness, so as no longer to have the things that are good as certain lessons belonging to him, but to be good.</p>

<p>Wherefore also it is most incumbent on such to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> as they do the Divinity rightly, and having the moral excellence suitable to him; who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what things are really good, and what are to be asked, and when and how in each individual case. It is the extremest stupidity to ask of them who are no gods, as if they were gods; or to ask those things which are not beneficial, begging <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for themselves under the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</p>

<p>Whence, as is right, there being only one good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things be given from Him alone, and that some remain, we and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But not similarly. For it is not the same thing to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the gift remain, and to endeavour to obtain it for the first time.</p>

<p>The averting of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> is a species of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; but such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is never to be used for the injury of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, except that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, in devoting attention to righteousness, may make use of this petition in the case of those who are past feeling.</p>

<p>Prayer is, then, to speak more boldly, converse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Though whispering, consequently, and not opening the lips, we speak in silence, yet we cry inwardly.  For God hears continually all the inward converse. So also we raise the head and lift the hands to heaven, and set the feet in motion  at the closing utterance of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, following the eagerness of the spirit directed towards the intellectual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and endeavouring to abstract the body from the earth, along with the discourse, raising the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> aloft, winged with longing for better things, we compel it to advance to the region of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, magnanimously despising the chain of the flesh. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> right well, that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> willingly passes over the whole world, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> certainly did over <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, showing clearly, above all, that he will be as near as possible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if some assign definite hours for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>&mdash; as, for example, the third, and sixth, and ninth&mdash; yet the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> throughout his whole life, endeavouring by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to have fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And, briefly, having reached to this, he leaves behind him all that is of no service, as having now received the perfection of the man that acts by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But the distribution of the hours into a threefold division, honoured with as many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, those are acquainted with, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the blessed triad of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> abodes. </p>

<p>Having got to this point, I recollect the doctrines about there being no necessity to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, introduced by certain of the heterodox, that is, the followers of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Prodicus. That they may not then be inflated with conceit about this godless wisdom of theirs, as if it were strange, let them learn that it was embraced before by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> called Cyrenaics.  Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) of those <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called [<a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>] shall meet with confutation at a fitting time; so that the assault on them, by no means brief, may not, by being introduced into the commentary, break the discourse in hand, in which we are showing that the only really <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man is he who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom alone the petition made in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is granted,  on asking and on thinking. For as God can do all that He wishes, so the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> receives all that he asks. For, universally, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those who are and those who are not worthy of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; whence He gives to each what is suitable. Wherefore to those that are unworthy, though they ask often, He will not give; but He will give to those who are worthy.</p>

<p>Nor is petition superfluous, though <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are given without claim.</p>

<p>Now thanksgiving and request for the conversion of our neighbours is the function of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>; as also the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, giving thanks for the accomplishment of His ministry, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that as many as possible might attain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; that in the saved, by <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, God might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and He who is alone good and alone Saviour might be acknowledged through the Son from age to age. But also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that one will receive, is a species of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> gnostically laid up in store.</p>

<p>But if any occasion of converse with God becomes <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, no opportunity of access to God ought to be omitted. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, in union with [God's] blessed Providence, exhibits in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> confession the perfect beneficence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, and the reciprocal benevolence of the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are a kind of corresponding movement of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. For neither is God involuntarily good, as the fire is warming; but in Him the imparting of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, even if He receive the request previously. Nor shall he who is saved be saved against his will, for he is not inanimate; but he will above all voluntarily and of free choice speed to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore also man received the commandments in order that he might be self-impelled, to whatever he wished of things to be chosen and to be avoided. Wherefore God does not do good by necessity, but from His free choice benefits those who spontaneously turn. For the Providence which extends to us from God is not ministerial, as that service which proceeds from inferiors to superiors. But in pity for our weakness, the continual dispensations of Providence work, as the care of shepherds towards the sheep, and of a king towards his subjects; we ourselves also conducting ourselves obediently towards our superiors, who take the management of us, as appointed, in accordance with the commission from God with which they are invested.</p>

<p>Consequently those who render the most free and kingly service, which is the result of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mind and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, are servants and attendants of the Divinity. Each place, then, and time, in which we entertain the idea of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is in reality sacred.</p>

<p>When, then, the man who chooses what is right, and is at the same time of thankful heart, makes his request in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he contributes to the obtaining of it, gladly taking hold in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the thing desired. For when the Giver of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things perceives the susceptibility on our part, all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things follow at once the conception of them. Certainly in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the character is sifted, how it stands with respect to duty.</p>

<p>But if voice and expression are given us, for the sake of understanding, how can God not hear the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, since assuredly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hears <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, mind? Whence God does not wait for loquacious tongues, as interpreters among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> absolutely the thoughts of all; and what the voice intimates to us, that our thought, which even before the creation He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would come into our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Prayer, then, may be uttered without the voice, by concentrating the whole spiritual nature within on expression by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in un-distracted turning towards God.</p>

<p>And since the dawn is an image of the day of birth, and from that point the light which has shone forth at first from the darkness increases, there has also dawned on those involved in darkness a day of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In correspondence with the manner of the sun's rising, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are made looking towards the sunrise in the east. Whence also the most ancient temples looked towards the west, that people might be taught to turn to the east when facing the images.  <q>Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be directed before You as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, the uplifting of my hands as the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q>  say the Psalms.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is most injurious, not to others alone, but to themselves also. If, then, they should ask and receive what they call pieces of good fortune, these injure them after they receive them, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how to use them. For they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to possess what they have not, and they ask things which seem, but are not, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.  But the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will ask the permanence of the things he possesses, adaptation for what is to take place, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of those things which he shall receive. And the things which are really good, the things which concern the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that they may belong to him, and remain with him. And so he desires not anything that is absent, being content with what is present. For he is not deficient in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are proper to him; being already sufficient for himself, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But having become sufficient in himself, he stands in no want of other things. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the sovereign will, and possessing as soon as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, being brought into close contact with the almighty power, and earnestly desiring to be spiritual, through boundless <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he is united to the Spirit.</p>

<p>Thus he, being magnanimous, possessing, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, what is the most precious of all, the best of all, being quick in applying himself to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, retains in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the permanent energy of the objects of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, that is the perspicacious keenness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And this power he strives to his utmost to acquire, by obtaining command of all the influences which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the mind; and by applying himself without intermission to speculation, by exercising himself in the training of abstinence from pleasures, and of right conduct in what he does; and besides, furnished with great experience both in study and in life, he has freedom of speech, not the power of a babbling tongue, but a power which employs plain language, and which neither for favour nor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> conceals anything of the things which may be worthily said at the fitting time, in which it is highly necessary to say them. He, then, having received the things respecting God from the mystic <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, employs language which urges the magnitude of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in accordance with its worth; and shows its results with an inspired elevation of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, being associated gnostically, as far as possible, with intellectual and spiritual objects.</p>

<p>Whence he is always mild and meek, accessible, affable, long-suffering, grateful, endued with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Such a man is rigid, not alone so as not to be corrupted, but so as not to be tempted. For he never exposes his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to submission, or capture at the hands of Pleasure and Pain. If the Word, who is Judge, call; he, having grown inflexible, and not indulging a whit the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, walks unswervingly where <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> advises him to go; being very well persuaded that all things are managed consummately well, and that progress to what is better goes on in the case of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have chosen <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, till they come to the Good itself, to the Father's vestibule, so to speak, close to the great High Priest. Such is our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, faithful, persuaded that the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> are managed in the best way. Particularly, he is well pleased with all that happens. In accordance with reason, then, he asks for none of those things in life required for necessary use; being persuaded that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, supplies the good with whatever is for their benefit, even though they do not ask.</p>

<p>For my view is, that as all things are supplied to the man of art according to the rules of art, and to the Gentile in a Gentile way, so also to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> all things are supplied gnostically. And the man who turns from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> will ask for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while he that ascends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> will ask for the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who has reached the summit, will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> may grow and abide, as the common man will for continual good health.</p>

<p>Nay, he will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may never fall from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; giving his most strenuous co-operation in order that he may become infallible. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that some of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, through carelessness, were hurled to the earth, not having yet quite reached that state of oneness, by extricating themselves from the propensity to that of duality.</p>

<p>But him, who from this has trained himself to the summit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the elevated height of the perfect man, all things relating to time and place help on, now that he has made it his choice to live infallibly, and subjects himself to training in order to the attainment of the stability of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on each side. But in the case of those in whom there is still a heavy corner, leaning downwards, even that part which has been elevated by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is dragged down. In him, then, who by gnostic training has acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which cannot be lost, habit becomes nature. And just as weight in a stone, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such an one is incapable of being lost. Not without, but through the exercise of will, and by the force of reason, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and Providence, is it brought to become incapable of being lost. Through care it becomes incapable of being lost. He will employ caution so as to avoid sinning, and consideration to prevent the loss of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> appears to produce consideration, by teaching to perceive the things that are capable of contributing to the permanence of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The highest thing is, then, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore also by it <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is so preserved as to be incapable of being lost. And he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> has consequently been demonstrated by us to be the only <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man.</p>

<p>He rejoices in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things present, and is glad on account of those promised, as if they were already present. For they do not elude his notice, as if they were still absent, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by anticipation what sort they are. Being then persuaded by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> how each future thing shall be, he possesses it. For want and defect are measured with reference to what appertains to one. If, then, he possesses wisdom, and wisdom is a divine thing, he who partakes of what has no want will himself have no want. For the imparting of wisdom does not take place by activity and receptivity moving and stopping each other, or by anything being abstracted or becoming defective. Activity is therefore shown to be undiminished in the act of communication. So, then, our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> possesses all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as far as possible; but not likewise in number; since otherwise he would be incapable of changing his place through the due inspired stages of advancement and acts of administration.</p>

<p>Him God helps, by honouring him with closer oversight. For were not all things made for the sake of good men, for their possession and advantage, or rather <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? He will not then deprive, of the things which exist for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, those for whose sake they were created. For, evidently in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their excellent nature and their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> choice, he inspires those who have made choice of a good life with strength for the rest of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; exhorting some, and helping others, who of themselves have become worthy. For all good is capable of being produced in the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>; if indeed it is his aim to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and do everything intelligently. And as the physician ministers health to those who co-operate with him in order to health, so also God ministers <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who co-operate for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and good conduct; and since what the commandments enjoin are in our own power, along with the performance of them, the promise is accomplished.</p>

<p>And what follows seems to me to be excellently said by the Greeks. An athlete of no mean <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> among those of old, having for a long time subjected his body to thorough training in order to the attainment of manly strength, on going up to the Olympic games, cast his eye on the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Pis&aelig;an Zeus, and said: <q>O Zeus, if all the requisite preparations for the contest have been made by me, come, give me the victory, as is right.</q> For so, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who has unblameably and with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> fulfilled all that depends on him, in the direction of learning, and training, and well-doing, and pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the whole contributes to carry <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on to perfection. From us, then, are demanded the things which are in our own power, and of the things which pertain to us, both present and absent, the choice, and desire, and possession, and use, and permanence.</p>

<p>Wherefore also he who holds converse with God must have his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> immaculate and stainlessly pure, it being essential to have made himself perfectly good.</p>

<p>But also it becomes him to make all his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> gently with the good. For it is a dangerous thing to take part in others' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> along with those who have more recently <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, for those things in respect of which it is their duty to act together. And his whole life is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> festival.  His <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and praises, and readings in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> before meals, and psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> during meals and before bed, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> also again during night. By these he unites himself to the divine <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, from continual recollection, engaged in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> which has everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>And what? Does he not also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the other kind of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, which consists in the giving both of doctrines and of money to those who need? Assuredly. But he does not use wordy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by his mouth; having learned to ask of the Lord what is requisite. In every place, therefore, but not ostensibly and visibly to the multitude, he will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But while engaged in walking, in conversation, while in silence, while engaged in reading and in works according to reason, he in every mood <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>.  If he but form the thought in the secret chamber of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and call on the Father <q>with unspoken groanings,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023578"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span> He is near, and is at his side, while yet speaking. Inasmuch as there are but three ends of all action, he does everything for its excellence and utility; but doing anything for the sake of pleasure,  he leaves to those who pursue the common life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Gnostic So Addicted to Truth as Not to Need to Use an Oath</h2>

<p>The man of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> character in such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is far from being apt to lie and to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is a decisive affirmation, with the taking of the divine name. For how can he, that is once faithful, show himself unfaithful, so as to require an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; and so that his life may not be a sure and decisive <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>? He lives, and walks, and shows the trustworthiness of his affirmation in an unwavering and sure life and speech. And if the wrong lies in the judgment of one who does and says [something], and not in the suffering of one who has been wronged,  he will neither lie nor commit <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> so as to wrong the Deity, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it by nature is incapable of being harmed. Nor yet will he lie or commit any transgression, for the sake of the neighbour whom he has learned to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, though he be not on terms of intimacy. Much more, consequently, will he not lie or <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjure</a> himself on his own account, since he never with his will can be found doing wrong to himself.</p>

<p>But he does not even <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, preferring to make averment, in affirmation by <q>yea,</q> and in denial by <q>nay.</q> For it is an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, or to produce  anything from the mind in the way of confirmation in the shape of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. It suffices, then, with him, to add to an affirmation or denial the expression <q>I say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> for confirmation to those who do not perceive the certainty of his answer. For he ought, I think, to maintain a life calculated to inspire confidence towards those without, so that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> may not even be asked; and towards himself and those with whom he associates  good feeling, which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> righteousness.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> swears <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but is not apt to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, having rarely recourse to an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, just as we have said. And his speaking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> arises from his accord with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This speaking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, then, is found to be the result of correctness in duties. Where, then, is the necessity for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to him who lives in accordance with the extreme of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?  He, then, that does not even <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> will be far from <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuring</a> himself. And he who does not transgress in what is ratified by compacts, will never <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>; since the ratification of the violation and of the fulfilment is by actions; as certainly lying and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> in affirming and swearing are contrary to duty. But he who lives <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, transgressing in none of his duties, when the judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is scrutinized, swears <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by his acts. Accordingly, testimony by the tongue is in his case superfluous.</p>

<p>Therefore, persuaded always that God is everywhere, and fearing not to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is unworthy of him to lie, he is satisfied with the divine consciousness and his own alone  And so he lies not, nor does anything contrary to his compacts. And so he swears not even when asked for his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; nor does he ever deny, so as to speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, though he should die by tortures.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Those Who Teach Others, Ought to Excel in Virtues</h2>

<p>The gnostic dignity is augmented and increased by him who has undertaken the first place in the teaching of others, and received the dispensation by word and deed of the greatest good on earth, by which he mediates contact and fellowship with the Divinity. And as those who worship terrestrial things <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to them as if they heard, confirming compacts before them; so, in men who are living images, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> majesty of the Word is received by the trustworthy teacher; and the beneficence exerted towards them is carried up to the Lord, after whose image he who is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man by instruction creates and harmonizes, renewing to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the man who receives instruction. For as the Greeks called steel <em>Ares</em>, and wine <em>Dionysus</em>, on account of a certain relation; so the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> considering the benefit of his neighbours as his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may be called a living image of the Lord, not as respects the peculiarity of form, but the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of power and similarity of preaching.</p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, he has in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he bears on his tongue, to those who are worthy to hear, speaking as well as living from assent and inclination. For he both thinks and speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; unless at any time, medicinally, as a physician for the safety of the sick, he may deceive or tell an untruth, according to the Sophists. </p>

<p>To illustrate: the noble apostle <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, though loudly declaring and writing that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> made with hands profits nothing.  But that he might not, by dragging all at once away from the law to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> those of the Hebrews who were reluctant listeners, compel them to break away from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, he, <q>accommodating himself to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, became a Jew that he might gain all.</q>  He, then, who submits to accommodate himself merely for the benefit of his neighbours, for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those for whose sake he accommodates himself, not partaking in any dissimulation through the peril impending over the just from those who <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> them, such an one by no means acts with compulsion.  But for the benefit of his neighbours alone, he will do things which would not have been done by him primarily, if he did not do them on their account. Such an one gives himself for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> whom he has begotten in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for an example to those who are capable of receiving the supreme economy of the philanthropic and God-loving Instructor, for confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his words, for the exercise of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Such an one is unenslaved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in word, enduring in labour, never willing to lie by uttered word, and in it always securing sinlessness; since <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, being spoken with a certain deceit, is not an inert word, but operates to mischief.</p>

<p>On every hand, then, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone testifies to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in deed and word. For he always does rightly in all things, both in word and action, and in thought itself.</p>

<p>Such, then, to speak cursorily, is the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. If, then, he does these things according to duty and right reason, he does them piously and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. And if such be the case, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> alone is really both <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and just, and God-fearing.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is not impious. For this was the point incumbent on us to demonstrate to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; so that he will never in any way do anything bad or base (which is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>). Consequently, therefore, he is not impious; but he alone fears <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, holily and dutifully worshipping the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the universal Ruler, and King, and Sovereign, with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Steps to Perfection</h2>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), to speak generally, a perfecting of man as man, is consummated by acquaintance with divine things, in character, life, and word, accordant and conformable to itself and to the divine Word. For by it <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is perfected, inasmuch as it is solely by it that the believer becomes perfect. Faith is an internal good, and without searching for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, confesses His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and glorifies Him as existent. Whence by starting from this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and being developed by it, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> respecting Him is to be acquired as far as possible.</p>

<p>Now we assert that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>) differs from the wisdom (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>), which is the result of teaching. For as far as anything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so far is it certainly wisdom; but in as far as anything is wisdom, it is not certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the term wisdom appears only in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the uttered word.</p>

<p>But it is not doubting in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but believing, that is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But Christ is both the foundation and the superstructure, by whom are both the beginning and the ends. And the extreme points, the beginning and the end&mdash; I mean <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash; are not taught. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, conveyed from communication through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God as a deposit, is entrusted to those who show themselves worthy of it; and from it the worth of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> beams forth from light to light. For it is said, <q>To him that has shall be given:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023589"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;19:26</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the inheritance.</p>

<p>And this takes place, whenever one hangs on the Lord by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and ascends along with Him to where the God and guard of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is. Whence at last (on account of the necessity for very great preparation and previous training in order both to hear what is said, and for the composure of life, and for advancing intelligently to a point beyond the righteousness of the law) it is that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is committed to those fit and selected for it. It leads us to the endless and perfect end, teaching us beforehand the future life that we shall lead, according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with gods; after we are freed from all punishment and penalty which we undergo, in consequence of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for salutary discipline. After which redemption the reward and the honours are assigned to those who have become perfect; when they have got done with purification, and ceased from all service, though it be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> service, and among <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Then become pure in heart, and near to the Lord, there awaits them restoration to everlasting <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; and they are called by the appellation of gods, being destined to sit on thrones with the other gods that have been first put in their places by the Saviour.</p>

<p>Knowledge is therefore quick in purifying, and fit for that acceptable transformation to the better. Whence also with ease it removes [the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>] to what is akin to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, divine and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and by its own light conveys man through the mystic stages of advancement; till it restores the pure in heart to the crowning place of rest; teaching to gaze on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, face to face, with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and comprehension. For in this consists the perfection of the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in its being with the Lord, where it is in immediate subjection to Him, after rising above all purification and service.</p>

<p>Faith is then, so to speak, a comprehensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the essentials;  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the strong and sure demonstration of what is received by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, built upon <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the Lord's teaching, conveying [the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>] on to infallibility, science, and comprehension. And, in my view, the first saving change is that from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as I said before; and the second, that from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And the latter terminating in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, thereafter gives the loving to the loved, that which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And, perchance, such an one has already attained the condition of <q>being equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023591"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;20:36</a></span> Accordingly, after the highest excellence in the flesh, changing always duly to the better, he urges his flight to the ancestral hall, through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> septenniad [of heavenly abodes] to the Lord's own mansion; to be a light, steady, and continuing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, entirely and in every part immutable.</p>

<p>The first mode of the Lord's operation mentioned by us is an exhibition of the recompense resulting from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Of the very great number of testimonies that there are, I shall adduce one, thus summarily expressed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David: <q>Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place? He who is guiltless in his hands, and pure in his heart; who has not lifted up his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to vanity, or <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> deceitfully to his neighbour. He shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has, in my opinion, concisely indicated the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. David, as appears, has cursorily demonstrated the Saviour to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by calling Him <q>the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob,</q> who preached and taught concerning the Spirit. Wherefore also the apostle designates as <q>the express image (<span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;</span>) of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023593"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and expressed the fact that the Almighty is the one and only God and Father, <q>whom no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023594"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> That God is one is intimated by those <q>who seek the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob;</q> whom being the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our Saviour and God characterizes as the Good Father. And <q>the generation of those that seek Him</q> is the elect race, devoted to inquiry after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore also the apostle says, <q>I shall profit you nothing, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or by doctrine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023595"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:6</a></span> </p>

<p>Although even by those who are not <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> some things are done rightly, yet not according to reason; as in the case of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For some who are naturally high-spirited, and have afterwards without reason fostered this disposition, rush to many things, and act like brave men, so as sometimes to succeed in achieving the same things; just as endurance is easy for mechanics. But it is not from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or with the same object; not were they to give their whole body. <q>For they have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> according to the apostle. <span class="stiki" id="note023596"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> </p> 

<p>All the action, then, of a man possessed of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is right action; and that done by a man not possessed of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is wrong action, though he observe a plan; since it is not from reflection that he acts bravely, nor does he direct his action in those things which proceed from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to any useful purpose.</p>

<p>The same holds also with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. So too the analogy is preserved in religion. Our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, not only is such in reference to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; but corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are the commands respecting the rest of the conduct of life. For it is our purpose at present to describe the life of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>,  not to present the system of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, which we shall afterwards explain at the fitting time, preserving the order of topics.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Description of the Gnostic's Life</h2>

<p>Respecting the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, he conceives <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and grandly in virtue of his reception of divine teaching. Beginning, then, with admiration of the Creation, and affording of himself a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his capability for receiving <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he becomes a ready pupil of the Lord. Directly on hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Providence, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in consequence of the admiration he entertained. Through the power of impulse thence derived he devotes his energies in every way to learning, doing all those things by means of which he shall be able to acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what he desires. And desire blended with inquiry arises as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> advances. And this is to become worthy of speculation, of such a character, and such importance. So shall the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> taste of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is not his ears, but his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that he yields up to the things signified by what is spoken. Accordingly, apprehending essences and things through the words, he brings his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is fit, to what is essential; apprehending (e.g.) in the peculiar way in which they are spoken to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, the commands, <q>Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,</q> <q>Do not kill;</q> and not as they are understood by other people.  Training himself, then, in scientific speculation, he proceeds to exercise himself in larger generalizations and grander propositions; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> right well that <q>He that teaches man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, is the Lord, the Lord acting by man's mouth. So also He assumed flesh.</p>

<p>As is right, then, he never prefers the pleasant to the useful; not even if a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were to entice him, when overtaken by circumstances, by wantonly urging him: since Joseph's master's wife was not able to seduce him from his steadfastness; but as she violently held his coat, divested himself of it&mdash;becoming bare of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but clothed with seemliness of character. For if the eyes of the master&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, I mean&mdash; saw not Joseph, yet those of the Almighty looked on. For we hear the voice, and see the bodily forms; but God scrutinizes the thing itself, from which the speaking and the looking proceed.</p>

<p>Consequently, therefore, though disease, and accident, and what is most terrible of all, death, come upon the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, he remains inflexible in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that all such things are a necessity of creation, and that, also by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they become the medicine of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, benefiting by discipline those who are difficult to reform; allotted according to desert, by Providence, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good.</p>

<p>Using the creatures, then, when the Word prescribes, and to the extent it prescribes, in the exercise of thankfulness to the Creator, he becomes master of the enjoyment of them.</p>

<p>He never cherishes resentment or harbours a grudge against any one, though deserving of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for his conduct. For he worships the Maker, and loves him, who shares life, pitying and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for him on account of his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. He indeed partakes of the affections of the body, to which, susceptible as it is of suffering by nature, he is bound. But in sensation he is not the primary subject of it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, then, in involuntary circumstances, by withdrawing himself from troubles to the things which really belong to him, he is not carried away with what is foreign to him. And it is only to things that are necessary for him that he accommodates himself, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is preserved unharmed. For it is not in supposition or seeming that he wishes to be faithful; but in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that is, in sure deed and effectual word.  Wherefore he not only praises what is noble, but endeavours himself to be noble; changing by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from a good and faithful servant into a friend, through the perfection of habit, which he has acquired in purity from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> instruction and great discipline.</p>

<p>Striving, then, to attain to the summit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>); decorous in character; composed in mien; possessing all those advantages which belong to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>; fixing his eye on fair models, on the many patriarchs who have lived rightly, and on very many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> reckoned without number, and above all, on the Lord, who taught and showed it to be possible for him to attain that highest life of all&mdash;he therefore loves not all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the world, which are within his grasp, that he may not remain on the ground, but the things hoped for, or rather already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, being hoped for so as to be apprehended.</p>

<p>So then he undergoes toils, and trials, and afflictions, not as those among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who are endowed with manliness, in the hope of present troubles ceasing, and of sharing again in what is pleasant; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has inspired him with the firmest persuasion of receiving the hopes of the future. Wherefore he contemns not alone the pains of this world, but all its pleasures.</p>

<p>They say, accordingly, that the blessed Peter, on seeing his wife led to death, rejoiced on account of her call and conveyance home, and called very encouragingly and comfortingly, addressing her by name, <q>Remember the Lord.</q> Such was the marriage of the blessed and their perfect disposition towards those dearest to them. </p>

<p>Thus also the apostle says, <q>that he who marries should be as though he married not,</q>  and deem his marriage free of inordinate affection, and inseparable from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Lord; to which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> husband exhorted his wife to cling on her departure out of this life to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p>Was not then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the hope after death conspicuous in the case of those who gave thanks to God even in the very extremities of their punishments? For firm, in my opinion, was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they possessed, which was followed by works of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>In all circumstances, then, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> strong, in a condition of extreme health and strength, like the body of an athlete.</p>

<p>For he is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, in judging what ought to be done by the just man; having obtained the principles from God from above, and having acquired, in order to the divine resemblance, moderation in bodily pains and pleasures. And he struggles against fears boldly, trusting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Certainly, then, the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, adorned with perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is the earthly image of the divine power; its development being the joint result of nature, of training, of reason, all together. This beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> becomes a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when it acquires a disposition in the whole of life corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Such an one consequently withstands all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of everything terrible, not only of death, but also poverty and disease, and ignominy, and things akin to these; being unconquered by pleasure, and lord over irrational desires. For he well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is and what is not to be done; being perfectly aware what things are really to be dreaded, and what not. Whence he bears intelligently what the Word intimates to him to be requisite and necessary; intelligently discriminating what is really safe (that is, good), from what appears so; and things to be dreaded from what seems so, such as death, disease, and poverty; which are rather so in opinion than in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>This is the really <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, who is without <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; having, through the habit or disposition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> endued with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, transcended the whole life of passion. He has everything dependent on himself for the attainment of the end. For those accidents which are called terrible are not formidable to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, because they are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And those which are really to be dreaded are foreign to the gnostic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, being diametrically opposed to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and it is impossible for contraries to meet in the same person at the same time. He, then, who faultlessly acts the drama of life which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given him to play, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both what is to be done and what is to be endured.</p>

<p>Is it not then from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what is and what is not to be dreaded that cowardice arises? Consequently the only man of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both present and future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; along with these, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as I have said, also the things which are in reality not to be dreaded. Because, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> alone to be hateful, and destructive of what contributes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, protected by the armour of the Lord, he makes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against it.</p>

<p>For if anything is caused through folly, and the operation or rather co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, this thing is not straightway the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or folly. For no action is wisdom. For wisdom is a habit. And no action is a habit. The action, then, that arises from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, is not already <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For neither perturbations of mind nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, though proceeding from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.</p>

<p>No one, then, who is irrationally brave is a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>;  since one might call children brave, who, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what is to be dreaded, undergo things that are frightful. So they touch fire even. And the wild beasts that rush close on the points of spears, having a brute <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, might be called valiant. And such people might perhaps call jugglers valiant, who tumble on swords with a certain dexterity, practising a mischievous art for sorry gain. But he who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> brave, with the peril arising from the bad feeling of the multitude before his eyes, courageously awaits whatever comes. In this way he is distinguished from others that are called <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, inasmuch as some furnish occasions for themselves, and rush into the heart of dangers, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how (for it is right to use mild language); while they, in accordance with right reason, protect themselves; then, on God really calling them, promptly surrender themselves, and confirm the call, from being conscious of no precipitancy, and present the man to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> rational <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Neither, then, enduring lesser dangers from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of greater, like other people, nor dreading censure at the hands of their equals, and those of like sentiments, do they continue in the confession of their calling; but from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God they willingly <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the call, with no other aim in view than pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not for the sake of the reward of their toils.</p>

<p>For some suffer from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and others from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of some other sharper punishment, and others for the sake of pleasures and delights after death, being children in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; blessed indeed, but not yet become men in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is. For there are, as in the gymnastic contests, so also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, crowns for men and for children. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is to be chosen for itself, and for nothing else. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, along with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is developed from the discipline of life, he having always studied to acquire mastery over the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> makes its own athlete fearless and dauntless, and confident in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, anointing and training him; as righteousness secures for him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> in his whole life.  For it was a compendium of righteousness to say, <q>Let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay.</q> </p>

<p>And the same holds with self-control. For it is neither for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, as the athletes for the sake of crowns and fame; nor on the other hand, for <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, as some pretend to exercise self-control, pursuing what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with terrible suffering. Nor is it from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the body for the sake of health. Nor any more is any man who is temperate from rusticity, who has not tasted pleasures, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a man of self-control. Certainly those who have led a laborious life, on tasting pleasures, immediately break down the inflexibility of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> into pleasures. Such are they who are restrained by law and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For on finding a favourable opportunity they defraud the law, by giving what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the slip. But self-control, desirable for its own sake, perfected through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, abiding ever, makes the man lord and master of himself; so that the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is temperate and passionless, incapable of being dissolved by pleasures and pains, as they say adamant is by fire.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these, then, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of all science the most sacred and most sovereign.</p>

<p>For by the service of what is best and most exalted, which is characterized by unity, it renders the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> at once friend and son, having in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> grown <q>a perfect man, up to the measure of full stature.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023605"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<p>Further, agreement in the same thing is consent. But what is the same is one. And friendship is consummated in likeness; the community lying in oneness. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, consequently, in virtue of being a lover of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the really perfect man and friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is placed in the rank of son. For these are names of nobility and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and perfection in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which crowning step of advancement the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives, when it has become quite pure, reckoned worthy to behold everlastingly God Almighty, <q>face,</q> it is said, <q>to face.</q> For having become wholly spiritual, and having in the spiritual Church gone to what is of kindred nature, it abides in the rest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The True Gnostic is Beneficent, Continent, and Despises Worldly Things</h2>

<p>Let these things, then, be so. And such being the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> towards the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; towards his neighbours, whether it be a domestic, or a lawful enemy, or whosoever&mdash; he is found equal and like. For he does not <q>despise his brother,</q> who, according to the divine law, is of the same father and mother. Certainly he relieves the afflicted, helping him with consolations, encouragements, and the necessaries of life; giving to all that need, though not similarly, but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, according to desert; furthermore, to him who persecutes and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, even if he need it; caring little for those who say to him that he has given out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, if it is not out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that he does so, but to give help. For how much more are those, who towards their enemies are devoid of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, and are haters of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, animated with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to those who belong to them?</p>

<p>Such an one from this proceeds to the accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of whom he ought chiefly to give to, and how much, and when, and how.</p>

<p>And who could with any reason become the enemy of a man who gives no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for enmity in any way? And is it not just as in the case of God? We say that God is the adversary of no one, and the enemy of no one (for He is the Creator of all, and nothing that exists is what He wills it not to be; but we assert that the disobedient, and those who walk not according to His commandments, are enemies to Him, as being those who are hostile to His covenant). We shall find the very same to be the case with the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, for he can never in any way become an enemy to any one; but those may be regarded enemies to him who turn to the contrary path.</p>

<p>In particular, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of liberality  which prevails among us is called <q>righteousness;</q> but the power of discriminating according to desert, as to greater and less, with reference to those who am proper subjects of it, is a form of the very highest righteousness.</p>

<p>There are things practiced in a vulgar style by some people, such as control over pleasures. For as, among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, there are those who, from the impossibility of obtaining what one sees,  and from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and also for the sake of greater pleasures, abstain from the delights that are before them; so also, in the case of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, some practice self-restraint, either out of regard to the promise or from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Well, such self-restraint is the basis of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and an approach to something better, and an effort after perfection. For <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord,</q> it is said, <q>is the beginning of wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023608"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;1:7</a></span> But the perfect man, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <q>bears all things, endures all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023609"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> <q>as not pleasing man, but God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023610"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> Although praise follows him as a consequence, it is not for his own advantage, but for the imitation and benefit of those who praise him.</p>

<p>According to another view, it is not he who merely controls his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that is called a continent man, but he who has also achieved the mastery over <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and has acquired surely the great accomplishments of science, from which he produces as fruits the activities of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is never, on the occurrence of an emergency, dislodged from the habit peculiar to him. For the scientific possession of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is firm and unchangeable, being the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Knowledge, then, never becomes <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> nor does good change into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore also he eats, and drinks, and marries, not as principal ends of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but as necessary. I name marriage even, if the Word prescribe, and as is suitable. For having become perfect, he  has the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for examples; and one is not really shown to be a man in the choice of single life; but he surpasses men, who, disciplined by marriage, procreation of children, and care for the house, without pleasure or pain, in his solicitude for the house has been inseparable from God's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and withstood all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> arising through children, and wife, and domestics, and possessions. But he that has no <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is in a great degree free of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Caring, then, for himself alone, he is surpassed by him who is inferior, as far as his own personal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is concerned, but who is superior in the conduct of life, preserving certainly, in his care for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a minute image.</p>

<p>But we must as much as possible subject the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to varied preparatory exercise, that it may become susceptible to the reception of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Do you not see how wax is softened and copper purified, in order to receive the stamp applied to it? Just as death is the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, so is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as it were the rational death urging the spirit away, and separating it from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and leading it on to the life of well-doing, that it may then say with confidence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I live as You wish.</q> For he who makes it his purpose to please men cannot please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the multitude choose not what is profitable, but what is pleasant. But in pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one as a consequence gets the favour of the good among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. How, then, can what relates to meat, and drink, and amorous pleasure, be agreeable to such an one? Since he views with suspicion even a word that produces pleasure, and a pleasant movement and act of the mind. <q>For no one can serve two masters, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023612"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;16:13</a></span> it is said; meaning not simply money, but the resources arising from money bestowed on various pleasures. In reality, it is not possible for him who magnanimously and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to serve antagonistic pleasures.</p>

<p>There is one alone, then, who from the beginning was free of concupiscence&mdash; the philanthropic Lord, who for us became man. And whosoever endeavour to be assimilated to the impress given by Him, strive, from exercise, to become free of concupiscence. For he who has exercised concupiscence and then restrained himself, is like a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who becomes again a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> by continence. Such is the reward of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, rendered to the Saviour and Teacher, which He Himself asked for&mdash;abstinence from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, activity in doing good, by which <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is acquired.</p>

<p>As, then, those who have learned the arts procure their living by what they have been taught, so also is the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> saved, procuring life by what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. For he who has not formed the wish to extirpate the passion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, kills himself. But, as seems, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the starvation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> its sustenance.</p>

<p>Such are the gnostic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> likened to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who wait for the Lord. For they are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, in respect of their abstaining from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And in respect of their waiting out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Lord and kindling their light for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of things, they are wise <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, saying, <q>Lord, for long we have desired to receive You; we have lived according to what You have enjoined, transgressing none of Your commandments. Wherefore also we claim the promises. And we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for what is beneficial, since it is not requisite to ask of You what is most excellent. And we shall take everything for good; even though the exercises that meet us, which Your arrangement brings to us for the discipline of our steadfastness, appear to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, from his exceeding <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, is better prepared to fail when he asks, than to get when he does not ask.</p>

<p>His whole life is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and converse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And if he be pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he will by all means obtain what he wishes. For God says to the righteous man, <q>Ask, and I will give you; think, and I will do.</q> If beneficial, he will receive it at once; and if injurious, he will never ask it, and therefore he will not receive it. So it shall be as he wishes.</p>

<p>But if one say to us, that some sinners even obtain according to their requests, [we should say] that this rarely takes place, by reason of the righteous goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And it is granted to those who are capable of doing others good. Whence the gift is not made for the sake of him that asked it; but the divine dispensation, foreseeing that one would be saved by his means, renders the boon again righteous. And to those who are worthy, things which are really good are given, even without their asking.</p>

<p>Whenever, then, one is righteous, not from necessity or out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or hope, but from free choice, this is called the royal road, which the royal race travel. But the byways are slippery and precipitous. If, then, one take away <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if the illustrious among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who use such freedom of speech, will any longer endure afflictions.</p>

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called <q>briars and thorns.</q> Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> labours in the Lord's vineyard, planting, pruning, watering; being the divine husbandman of what is planted in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Those, then, who have not done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, think it right to receive the wages of ease. But he who has done good out of free choice, demands the recompense as a good workman. He certainly shall receive double wages&mdash; both for what he has not done, and for what good he has done.</p>

<p>Such a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is tempted by no one except with God's permission, and that for the benefit of those who are with him; and he strengthens them for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, encouraging them by manly endurance. And assuredly it was for this end, for the establishment and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, that the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were brought into trial and to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, then, hearing a voice ringing in his ear, which says, <q>Whom I shall strike, pity,</q> beseeches that those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him may repent. For the punishment of malefactors, to be consummated in the highways, is for children to behold;  for there is no possibility of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who has from choice trained himself to be excellent and good, ever being instructed or delighted with such spectacles.  And so, having become incapable of being softened by pleasures, and never falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he is not corrected by the examples of other men's sufferings. And far from being pleased with earthly pleasures and spectacles is he who has shown a noble contempt for the prospects held out in this world, although they are divine.</p>

<p><q>Not every one,</q> therefore, <q>that says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023616"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;7:21</a></span> Such is the gnostic labourer, who has the mastery of worldly desires even while still in the flesh; and who, in regard to things future and still invisible, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, has a sure persuasion, so that he regards them as more present than the things within reach. This able workman rejoices in what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but is cramped on account of his being involved in the necessities of life; not yet deemed worthy of the active participation in what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. So he uses this life as if it belonged to another&mdash;so far, that is, as is necessary.</p>

<p>He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also the enigmas of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of those days &mdash; I mean the Fourth and the Preparation. For the one has its name from Hermes, and the other from Aphrodite. He <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> in his life, in respect of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and voluptuousness, from which all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> grow. For we have already often above shown the three varieties of fornication, according to the apostle&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of pleasure, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. He <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, then, according to the Law, abstaining from bad <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and, according to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts. Temptations are applied to him, not for his purification, but, as we have said, for the good of his neighbours, if, making trial of toils and pains, he has despised and passed them by.</p>

<p>The same holds of pleasure. For it is the highest achievement for one who has had trial of it, afterwards to abstain. For what great thing is it, if a man restrains himself in what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not? He, in fulfilment of the precept, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, keeps the Lord's day,  when he abandons an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, and assumes that of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, glorifying the Lord's resurrection in himself. Further, also, when he has received the comprehension of scientific speculation, he deems that he sees the Lord, directing his eyes towards things invisible, although he seems to look on what he does not wish to look on; chastising the faculty of vision, when he perceives himself pleasurably affected by the application of his eyes; since he wishes to see and hear that alone which concerns him.</p>

<p>In the act of contemplating the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the brethren, he beholds the beauty of the flesh also, with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, which has become habituated to look solely upon that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, without carnal pleasure. And they are really brethren; inasmuch as, by reason of their elect creation, and their oneness of character, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, they do, and think, and speak the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good works, in accordance with the sentiments with which the Lord wished them as elect to be inspired.</p>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shows itself in their making choice of the same things; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in learning and thinking the same things; and hope, in desiring  the same things.</p>

<p>And if, through the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of life, he spend a small portion of time about his sustenance, he thinks himself defrauded, being diverted by business.  Thus not even in dreams does he look on anything that is unsuitable to an elect man. For thoroughly  a stranger and sojourner in the whole of life is every such one, who, inhabiting the city, despises the things in the city which are admired by others, and lives in the city as in a desert, so that the place may not compel him, but his mode of life show him to be just.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, to speak compendiously, makes up for the absence of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by the rectitude of his life, the accuracy of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by benefiting his relations, by <q>removing the mountains</q> of his neighbours, and putting away the irregularities of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Although each of us is his  own vineyard and labourer.</p>

<p>He, too, while doing the most excellent things, wishes to elude the notice of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, persuading the Lord along with himself that he is living in accordance with the  commandments, preferring these things from believing them to exist. <q>For where any one's mind is, there also is his treasure.</q> </p>

<p>He impoverishes himself, in order that he may never overlook a brother who has been brought into affliction, through the perfection that is in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, especially if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will bear want himself easier than his brother. He considers, accordingly, the other's pain his own grief; and if, by contributing from his own indigence in order to do good, he suffer any hardship, he does not fret at this, but augments his beneficence still more. For he possesses in its sincerity the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is exercised in reference to the affairs of life, and praises the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in practice and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he wins his praise <q>not from men, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023625"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> by the performance of what the Lord has taught.</p>

<p>He, attracted by his own hope, tastes not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are in the world, entertaining a noble contempt for all things here; pitying those that are chastised after death, who through punishment unwillingly make confession; having a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with reference to his departure, and being always ready, as <q>a stranger and pilgrim,</q> with regard to the inheritances here; mindful only of those that are his own, and regarding all things here as not his own; not only admiring the Lord's commandments, but, so to speak, being by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself partaker of the divine will; a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> chosen intimate of the Lord and His commands in virtue of being righteous; and princely and kingly as being a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>; despising all the gold on earth and under the earth, and dominion from shore to shore of ocean, so that he may cling to the sole service of the Lord. Wherefore also, in eating, and drinking, and marrying (if the Word enjoin), and even in seeing dreams,  he does and thinks what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</p>

<p>So is he always pure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. He also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in the society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as being already of angelic rank, and he is never out of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> keeping; and though he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> alone, he has the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>  standing with him.</p>

<p>He recognises a twofold [element in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>], both the activity of him who believes, and the excellence of that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> according to its worth; since also righteousness is twofold, that which is out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and that from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Accordingly it is said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is pure, remaining for ever and ever.</q>  For those that from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> turn to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness, remain for ever. Now <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> works abstinence from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> exhorts to the doing of good, by building up to the point of spontaneousness; that one may hear from the Lord, <q>I call you no longer servants, but friends,</q> and may now with confidence apply himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>And the form of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is thanksgiving for the past, for the present, and for the future as already through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> present. This is preceded by the reception of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And he asks to live the allotted life in the flesh as a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as free from the flesh, and to attain to the best things, and flee from the worse. He asks, too, relief in those things in which we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and conversion to the acknowledgment of them. <span class="stiki" id="note023629"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;18:18</a></span> </p>

<p>He follows, on his departure, Him who calls, as quickly, so to speak, as He who goes before calls, hasting by reason of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to give thanks; and having got there with Christ shows himself worthy, through his purity, to possess, by a process of blending, the power of God communicated by Christ. For he does not wish to be warm by participation in heat, or luminous by participation in flame, but to be wholly light.</p>

<p>He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> accurately the declaration, <q>Unless you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> father and mother, and besides your own life, and unless you bear the sign [of the cross].</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023630"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;14:26-27</a></span> For he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the inordinate affections of the flesh, which possess the powerful spell of pleasure; and entertains a noble contempt for all that belongs to the creation and nutriment of the flesh. He also withstands the corporeal  <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, putting a bridle-bit on the restive irrational spirit: <q>For the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023632"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> And <q>to bear the sign of [the cross]</q> is to bear about death, by taking farewell of all things while still alive; since there is not equal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <q>having sown the flesh,</q>  and in having formed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>He having acquired the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing good, exercises beneficence well, quicker than speaking; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that he may get a share in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his brethren, in order to confession and conversion on the part of his kindred; and eager to give a share to those dearest to him of his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. And so these are to him, friends. Promoting, then, the growth of the seeds deposited in him, according to the husbandry enjoined by the Lord, he continues free of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and becomes continent, and lives in spirit with those who are like him, among the choirs of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, though still detained on earth.</p>

<p>He, all day and night, speaking and doing the Lord's commands, rejoices exceedingly, not only on rising in the morning and at noon, but also when walking about, when asleep, when dressing and undressing;  and he teaches his son, if he has a son. He is inseparable from the commandment and from hope, and is ever giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like the living creatures figuratively spoken of by Esaias, and submissive in every trial, he says, <q>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023635"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> For such also was Job; who after the spoiling of his effects, along with the health of his body, resigned all through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For <q>he was,</q> it is said, <q>just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and kept apart from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023636"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Now the word <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q> points out all duties toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the entire course of life. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> which, he was a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. For we must neither cling too much to such things, even if they are good, seeing they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, nor on the other hand detest them, if they are bad; but we must be above both [good and bad], trampling the latter under foot, and passing on the former to those who need them. But the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is cautious in accommodation, lest he be not perceived, or lest the accommodation become disposition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Description of the Gnostic Continued</h2>

<p>He never remembers those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against him, but forgives them. Wherefore also he righteously <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, saying, <q>Forgive us; for we also forgive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023637"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;11:4</a></span> For this also is one of the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes, to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> nothing, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> no one. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are the work of one will. And is it not the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who wishes the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> to be perfect as <q>the heavenly Father,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023638"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;5:48</a></span> that is, Himself, who says, <q>Come, you children, hear from me the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord?</q>  He wishes him no longer to stand in need of help by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but to receive it from Himself, having become worthy, and to have protection from Himself by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>.</p>

<p>Such an one demands from the Lord, and does not merely ask. And in the case of his brethren in want, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will not ask himself for abundance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to bestow, but will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the supply of what they need may be furnished to them. For so the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> gives his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to those who are in need, and by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> they are supplied, without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and without vanity.</p>

<p>Penury and disease, and such trials, are often sent for admonition, for the correction of the past, and for care for the future. Such an one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for relief from them, in virtue of possessing the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not out of vainglory; but from the very fact of his being a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, he works beneficence, having become the instrument of the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>They say in the traditions  that Matthew the apostle constantly said, that <q>if the neighbour of an elect man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the elect man has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For had he conducted himself as the Word prescribes, his neighbour also would have been filled with such reverence for the life he led as not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p>

<p>What, then, shall we say of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> himself? <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>that you are the temple of God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023641"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> is consequently divine, and already <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, God-bearing, and God-borne. Now the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, showing that sinning is foreign to him, sells those who have fallen away to strangers, saying, <q>Look not on a strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q>  plainly pronounces <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> foreign and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the temple is great, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and it is small, as the man who preserves the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. He, therefore, who has God resting in him will not desire anything else. At once leaving all hindrances, and despising all matter which distracts him, he cleaves the heaven by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And passing through the spiritual Essences, and all rule and authority, he touches the highest thrones, hasting to that alone for the sake of which alone he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>.</p>

<p>Mixing, then, <q>the serpent with the dove,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023643"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> he lives at once perfectly and with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, mingling <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with hope, in order to the expectation of the future. For he is conscious of the boon he has received, having become worthy of obtaining it; and is translated from slavery to adoption, as the consequence of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rather <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Him, for the end, he puts forth energies corresponding to the worth of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For works follow <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as the shadow the body.</p>

<p>Rightly, then, he is not disturbed by anything which happens; nor does he suspect those things, which, through divine arrangement, take place for good. Nor is he ashamed to die, having a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and being fit to be seen by the Powers. Cleansed, so to speak, from all the stains of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> right well that it will be better with him after his departure.</p>

<p>Whence he never prefers pleasure and profit to the divine arrangement, since he trains himself by the commands, that in all things he may be well pleasing to the Lord, and praiseworthy in the sight of the world, since all things depend on the one Sovereign God. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it is said, came to His own, and His own received Him not. Wherefore also in the use of the things of the world he not only gives thanks and praises the creation, but also, while using them as is right, is praised; since the end he has in view terminates in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by gnostic activity in accordance with the commandments.</p>

<p>Thence now, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> collecting materials to be the food of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, having embraced nobly the magnitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he advances to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> recompense of translation hence. For he has heard the Psalm which says: <q>Encircle Zion, and encompass it, tell upon its towers.</q>  For it intimates, I think, those who have sublimely embraced the Word, so as to become lofty towers, and to stand firmly in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>Let these statements concerning the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, containing the germs of the matter in as brief terms as possible, be made to the Greeks. But let it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that if the [mere] believer do rightly one or a second of these things, yet he will not do so in all nor with the highest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Description of the Gnostic Furnished by an Exposition of 1 Cor. vi. 1, Etc</h2>

<p>Now, of what I may call the passionlessness which we attribute to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> (in which the perfection of the believer, <q>advancing by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, comes to a perfect man, to the measure of full stature,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023645"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> by being assimilated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by becoming <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> angelic), many other testimonies from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, occur to me to adduce. But I think it better, on account of the length of the discourse, that such an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> should be devolved on those who wish to take pains, and leave it to them to elaborate the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> by the selection of Scriptures.</p>

<p>One passage, accordingly, I shall in the briefest terms advert to, so as not to leave the topic unexplained.</p>

<p>For in the first Epistle to the Corinthians the divine apostle says: <q>Dare any of you, having a matter against the other, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall judge the world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023646"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:1-2</a></span> and so on.</p>

<p>The section being very long, we shall exhibit the meaning of the apostle's utterance by employing such of the apostolic expressions as are most pertinent, and in the briefest language, and in a sort of cursory way, interpreting the discourse in which he describes the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. For he does not merely instance the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> as characterized by suffering wrong rather than do wrong; but he teaches that he is not mindful of injuries, and does not allow him even to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against the man who has done him wrong. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the Lord expressly enjoined <q>to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for enemies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023647"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> </p>

<p>To say, then, that the man who has been injured goes to law before the unrighteous, is nothing else than to say that he shows a wish to retaliate, and a desire to injure the second in return, which is also to do wrong likewise himself.</p>

<p>And his saying, that he wishes <q>some to go to law before the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>,</q> points out those who ask by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that those who have done wrong should suffer retaliation for their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and intimates that the second are better than the former; but they are not yet <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>,  if they do not, having become entirely free of resentment, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for their enemies.</p>

<p>It is well, then, for them to receive right dispositions from repentance, which results in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to get enemies who entertain bad feeling, yet it is not hostile to any one. <q>For God makes His sun to shine on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023649"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and sent the Lord Himself to the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. And he that earnestly strives to be assimilated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the exercise of great absence of resentment, forgives seventy times seven times, as it were all his life through, and in all his course in this world (that being indicated by the enumeration of sevens) shows clemency to each and any one; if any during the whole time of his life in the flesh do the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> wrong. For he not only deems it right that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man should resign his property alone to others, being of the number of those who have done him wrong; but also wishes that the righteous man should ask of those judges forgiveness for the offenses of those who have done him wrong. And with reason, if indeed it is only in that which is external and concerns the body, though it go to the extent of death even, that those who attempt to wrong him take advantage of him; none of which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>.</p>

<p>And how shall one <q>judge</q> the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> who has become himself an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from that forgetfulness of injuries, which is according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? <q>Why do you not rather suffer wrong?</q> he says; <q>why are you not rather defrauded? Yea, you do wrong and defraud,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023650"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7-8</a></span> manifestly by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> against those who transgress in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and deprive of the philanthropy and goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as in you lies, those against whom you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <q>and these your brethren,</q>&mdash; not meaning those in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only, but also the proselytes. For whether he who now is hostile shall afterwards <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not as yet. From which the conclusion follows clearly, if all are not yet brethren to us, they ought to be regarded in that light. And now it is only the man of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> who recognises all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be the work of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and invested with one image in one nature, although some may be more turbid than others; and in the creatures he recognises the operation, by which again he adores the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023651"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9</a></span> He acts unrighteously who retaliates, whether by deed or word, or by the conception of a wish, which, after the training of the Law, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> rejects.</p>

<p><q>And such were some of you</q>&mdash; such manifestly as those still are whom you do not forgive; <q>but you are washed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023652"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> not simply as the rest, but with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; you have cast off the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in order to become assimilated, as far as possible, to the goodness of God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> by long-suffering, and by forgiveness <q>towards the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>,</q> casting on them the gleam of benignity in word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as the sun.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> will achieve this either by greatness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or by imitation of what is better. And that is a third <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <q>Forgive, and it shall be forgiven you;</q> the commandment, as it were, compelling to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through superabundance of goodness.</p>

<p><q>But you are sanctified.</q> For he who has come to this state is in a condition to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, falling into none of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in any way, but as it were already disembodied and already grown <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> without  this earth.</p>

<p><q>Wherefore,</q> he says, <q>you are justified in the name of the Lord.</q> You are made, so to speak, by Him to be righteous as He is, and are blended as far as possible with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For <q>are not all things lawful to me? Yet I will not be brought under the power of any,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023654"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> so as to do, or think, or speak anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall destroy,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023655"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span> &mdash; that is, such as think and live as if they were made for eating, and do not eat that they may live as a consequence, and apply to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as the primary end. And does he not say that these are, as it were, the fleshy parts of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body? As a body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord, the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, is symbolized.  Whence those, who are merely called, but do not live in accordance with the word, are the fleshy parts. <q>Now</q> this spiritual <q>body,</q> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, <q>is not for fornication.</q> Nor are those things which belong to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> life to be adopted by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For he who conducts himself heathenishly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whether in deed, or word, or even in thought, commits fornication with reference to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and his own body. He who in this way <q>is joined to the harlot,</q> that is, to conduct contrary to the Covenant becomes another <q>body,</q> not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <q>and one flesh,</q> and has a heathenish life and another hope. <q>But he that is joined to the Lord in spirit</q> becomes a spiritual body by a different kind of conjunction.</p>

<p>Such an one is wholly a son, an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, passionless, gnostic, perfect, formed by the teaching of the Lord; in order that in deed, in word, and in spirit itself, being brought close to the Lord, he may receive the mansion that is due to him who has reached manhood thus.</p>

<p>Let the specimen suffice to those who have ears. For it is not required to unfold the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, but only to indicate what is sufficient for those who are partakers in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to bring it to mind; who also will comprehend how it was said by the Lord, <q>Be perfect as your father, perfectly,</q>  by forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and forgetting injuries, and living in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of passionlessness. For as we call a physician perfect, and a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> perfect, so also, in my view, do we call a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> perfect. But not one of those points, although of the greatest importance, is assumed in order to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we do not say, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> do most impiously, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same. Ought we not then to be perfect, as the Father wills? For it is utterly impossible for any one to become perfect as God is. Now the Father wishes us to be perfect by living blamelessly, according to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>If, then, the statement being elliptical, we understand what is wanting, in order to complete the section for those who are incapable of understanding what is left out, we shall both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall walk at once piously and magnanimously, as befits the dignity of the commandment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Objection to Join the Church on Account of the Diversity of Heresies Answered</h2>

<p>Since it comes next to reply to the objections alleged against us by Greeks and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and since, in some of the questions previously discussed, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> also who adhere to other teaching give, their help, it will be well first to clear away the obstacles before us, and then, prepared thus for the solution of the difficulties, to advance to the succeeding Miscellany.</p>

<p>First, then, they make this objection to us, saying, that they ought not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in account of the discord of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is warped when some teach one set of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, others another.</p>

<p>To whom we say, that among you who are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and among the most famous of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among the Greeks, very many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have sprung up. And yet you do not say that one ought to hesitate to philosophize or <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaize</a>, because of the want of agreement of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> among you between themselves. And then, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> should be sown among the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as <q>tares among the wheat,</q> was foretold by the Lord; and what was predicted to take place could not but happen.  And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this is, that everything that is fair is followed by a foul blot. If one, then, violate his engagements, and go aside from the confession which he makes before us, are we not to stick to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> because he has belied his profession? But as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man must not prove false or fail to ratify what he has promised, although others violate their engagements; so also are we bound in no way to transgress the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And especially do we keep our profession in the most important points, while they traverse it.</p>

<p>Those, then, are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, who hold firmly to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And we may broadly make use of this reply, and say to them, that physicians holding opposite opinions according to their own schools, yet equally in point of fact treat patients. Does one, then, who is ill in body and needing treatment, not have recourse to a physician, on account of the different schools in medicine? No more, then, may he who in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sick and full of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, make a pretext of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, in reference to the recovery of health and conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Further, it is said that it is on account of <q>those that are approved that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> exist.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023660"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> [The apostle] calls <q>approved,</q> either those who in reaching <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> apply to the teaching of the Lord with some discrimination (as those are called skilful  money-changers, who distinguish the spurious coin from the genuine by the false stamp), or those who have already become approved both in life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>For this reason, then, we require greater attention and consideration in order to investigate how precisely we ought to live, and what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For it is plain that, from the very reason that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is difficult and arduous of attainment, questions arise from which spring the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, savouring of self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and vanity, of those who have not learned or apprehended <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, but only caught up a mere conceit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. With the greater care, therefore, are we to examine the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which alone has for its object the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And the toil is followed by sweet discovery and reminiscence.</p>

<p>On account of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, therefore, the toil of discovery must be undertaken; but we must not at all abandon [the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>]. For, on fruit being set before us, some real and ripe, and some made of wax, as like the real as possible, we are not to abstain from both on account of the resemblance. But by the exercise of the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and by reasoning of the most decisive character, we must distinguish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> from the seeming.</p>

<p>And as, while there is one royal highway, there are many others, some leading to a precipice, some to a rushing river or to a deep sea, no one will shrink from travelling by reason of the diversity, but will make use of the safe, and royal, and frequented way; so, though some say this, some that, concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we must not abandon it; but must seek out the most accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> respecting it. Since also among garden-grown vegetables weeds also spring up, are the husbandmen, then, to desist from gardening?</p>

<p>Having then from nature abundant means for examining the statements made, we ought to discover the sequence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore also we are rightly condemned, if we do not assent to what we ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and do not distinguish what is hostile, and unseemly, and unnatural, and false, from what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, consistent, and seemly, and according to nature. And these means must be employed in order to attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>This pretext is then, in the case of the Greeks, futile; for those who are willing may find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But in the case of those who adduce unreasonable excuses, their condemnation is unanswerable. For whether do they deny or admit that there is such a thing as demonstration? I am of opinion that all will make the admission, except those who take away the senses. There being demonstration, then, it is necessary to condescend to questions, and to ascertain by way of demonstration by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves how the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> failed, and how in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone and in the ancient Church is both the exactest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> best set of principles (<span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x1F34;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>). </p>

<p>Now, of those who diverge from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, some attempt to deceive themselves alone, and some also their neighbours. Those, then, who are called (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BE;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>) wise in their own opinions, who think that they have found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but have no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> demonstration, deceive themselves in thinking that they have reached a resting place. And of whom there is no inconsiderable multitude, who avoid investigations for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of refutations, and shun instructions for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of condemnation. But those who deceive those who seek access to them are very astute; who, aware that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, yet darken the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with plausible arguments.</p>

<p>But, in my opinion, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of plausible arguments is of one character, and that of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> arguments of another. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is necessary that the appellation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> should be expressed in contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; from which the Sophists, drawing certain things for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and burying them in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arts invented by themselves, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> rather in being at the head of a School than presiding over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Scripture the Criterion by Which Truth and Heresy are Distinguished. </h2>

<p>But those who are ready to toil in the most excellent pursuits, will not desist from the search after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, till they get the demonstration from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves.</p>

<p>There are certain criteria common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as the senses; and others that belong to those who have employed their wills and energies in what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;the methods which are pursued by the mind and reason, to distinguish between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and false propositions.</p>

<p>Now, it is a very great thing to abandon opinion, by taking one's stand between accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the rash wisdom of opinion, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he who hopes for everlasting rest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also that the entrance to it is toilsome <q>and strait.</q> And let him who has once received the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, even in the very hour in which he has come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <q>not turn back, like <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife,</q> as is said; and let him not go back either to his former life, which adheres to the things of sense, or to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. For they form the character, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. <q>For he that loves father or mother more than Me,</q> the Father and Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who regenerates and creates anew, and nourishes the elect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <q>is not worthy of Me</q>&mdash; He means, to be a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time also to be a friend, and of kindred nature. <q>For no man who looks back, and puts his hand to the plough, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023665"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> </p>

<p>But, as appears, many even down to our own time regard Mary, on account of the birth of her child, as having been in the puerperal state, although she was not. For some say that, after she brought forth, she was found, when examined, to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. </p>

<p>Now such to us are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Lord, which gave birth to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and continue virgin, in the concealment of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>And she brought forth, and yet brought not forth,</q>  says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; as having conceived of herself, and not from conjunction. Wherefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have conceived to <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, not having learned them, dismissed them as not having conceived.</p>

<p>Now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, having the same judgment, some, following the Word speaking, frame for themselves <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>; while others, giving themselves up to pleasures, wrest Scripture, in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.  And the lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as I think, needs force of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For those who make the greatest attempts must fail in things of the highest importance; unless, receiving from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself the rule of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they cleave to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But such people, in consequence of falling away from the right path, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in most individual points; as you might expect from not having the faculty for judging of what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and false, strictly trained to select what is essential. For if they had, they would have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. </p>

<p>As, then, if a man should, similarly to those drugged by Circe, become a beast; so he, who has spurned the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, and darted off to the opinions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> men, has ceased to be a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to remain faithful to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. But he who has returned from this deception, on hearing the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and turned his life to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is, as it were, from being a man made a god.</p>

<p>For we have, as the source of teaching, the Lord, both by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <q>in various manners and at sundry times,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023670"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> leading from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the end. But if one should suppose that another origin  was required, then no longer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> could an origin be preserved.</p>

<p>He, then, who of himself believes the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and voice of the Lord, which by the Lord acts to the benefiting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is rightly [regarded] faithful. Certainly we use it as a criterion in the discovery of things.  What is subjected to criticism is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> till it is so subjected; so that what needs criticism cannot be a first principle. Therefore, as is reasonable, grasping by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the indemonstrable first principle, and receiving in abundance, from the first principle itself, demonstrations in reference to the first principle, we are by the voice of the Lord trained up to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>For we may not give our adhesion to men on a bare statement by them, who might equally state the opposite. But if it is not enough merely to state the opinion, but if what is stated must be confirmed, we do not wait for the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but we establish the matter that is in question by the voice of the Lord, which is the surest of all demonstrations, or rather is the only demonstration; in which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> those who have merely tasted the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; while those who, having advanced further, and become correct expounders of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. Since also, in what pertains to life, craftsmen are superior to ordinary people, and model what is beyond common notions; so, consequently, we also, giving a complete exhibition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> persuade by demonstration. </p>

<p>And if those also who follow <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> venture to avail themselves of the prophetic Scriptures; in the first place they will not make use of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and then they will not quote them entire, nor as the body and texture of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> prescribe. But, selecting ambiguous expressions, they wrest them to their own opinions, gathering a few expressions here and there; not looking to the sense, but making use of the mere words. For in almost all the quotations they make, you will find that they attend to the names alone, while they alter the meanings; neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as they affirm, nor using the quotations they adduce, according to their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature.</p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not found by changing the meanings (for so people subvert all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teaching), but in the consideration of what perfectly belongs to and becomes the Sovereign <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in establishing each one of the points demonstrated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> again from similar Scriptures. Neither, then, do they want to turn to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, being ashamed to abandon the claims of self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; nor are they able to manage their opinions, by doing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But having first promulgated false <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> to men; plainly fighting against almost the whole Scriptures, and constantly confuted by us who contradict them; for the rest, even now partly they hold out against admitting the prophetic Scriptures, and partly disparage us as of a different nature, and incapable of understanding what is peculiar to them. And sometimes even they deny their own <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, when these are confuted, being ashamed openly to own what in private they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in teaching. For this may be seen in all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, when you examine the iniquities of their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. For when they are overturned by our clearly showing that they are opposed to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,  one of two things may be seen to have been done by those who defend the dogma. For they either despise the consistency of their own <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, or despise the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> itself, or rather their own hope. And they invariably prefer what seems to them to be more evident to what has been spoken by the Lord through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and, besides, attested and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>Seeing, therefore, the danger that they are in (not in respect of one dogma, but in reference to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>) of not discovering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for while reading the books we have ready at hand, they despise them as useless, but in their eagerness to surpass common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they have diverged from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, in consequence of not learning the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not having capacity for the grandeur of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, too indolent to descend to the bottom of things, reading superficially, they have dismissed the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.  Elated, then, by vain opinion, they are incessantly wrangling, and plainly care more to <em>seem</em> than to <em>be </em><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Not laying as foundations the necessary first principles of things; and influenced by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinions, then making the end to suit them, by compulsion; on account of being confuted, they spar with those who are engaged in the prosecution of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and undergo everything, and, as they say, ply every oar, even going the length of impiety, by disbelieving the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,  rather than be removed from the honours of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the boasted first seat in their churches; on account of which also they eagerly embrace that convivial couch of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Agape, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among us from what is already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, produces <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in what is not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; which [<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>] is, so to speak, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of demonstration. But, as appears, no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has at all ears to hear what is useful, but opened only to what leads to pleasure. Since also, if one of them would only <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he would be healed.</p>

<p>Now the cure of self-conceit (as of every ailment) is threefold: the ascertaining of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the mode of its removal; and thirdly, the training of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the accustoming it to assume a right attitude to the judgments come to. For, just like a disordered eye, so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that has been darkened by unnatural <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> cannot perceive distinctly the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but even overlooks what is before it.</p>

<p>They say, then, that in muddy water eels are caught by being blinded. And just as knavish boys bar out the teacher, so do these shut out the prophecies from their Church, regarding them with suspicion by reason of rebuke and admonition. In fact, they stitch together a multitude of lies and figments, that they may appear acting in accordance with reason in not admitting the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. So, then, they are not <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, inasmuch as they are not pleased with the divine commands, that is, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And as those almonds are called empty in which the contents are worthless, not those in which there is nothing; so also we call those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> empty, who are destitute of the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the traditions of Christ; bitter, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, like the wild almond, their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> originating with themselves, with the exception of such truths as they could not, by reason of their evidence, discard and conceal.</p>

<p>As, then, in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the soldier must not leave the post which the commander has assigned him, so neither must we desert the post assigned by the Word, whom we have received as the guide of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of life. But the most have not even inquired, if there is one that we ought to follow, and who this is, and how he is to be followed. For as is the Word, such also must the believer's life be, so as to be able to follow <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brings all things to end from the beginning by the right course.</p>

<p>But when one has transgressed against the Word, and thereby against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if it is through becoming powerless in consequence of some impression being suddenly made, he ought to see to have the impressions of reasons at hand. And if it is that he has become <q>common,</q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>  says, in consequence of being overcome the habits which formerly had sway by over him, the habits must be entirely put a stop to, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> trained to oppose them. And if it appears that conflicting <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> draw some away, these must be taken out of the way, and recourse is to be had to those who reconcile <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, and subdue by the charm of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> such of the untutored as are timid, by explaining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the connection of the Testaments. </p>

<p>But, as appears, we incline to ideas founded on opinion, though they be contrary, rather than to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is austere and grave. Now, since there are three states of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, opinion, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>&mdash; those who are in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> are the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, those in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, and those in opinion, the Heretics. Nothing, then, can be more clearly seen than those, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, making affirmations about what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the others respecting what they hold on the strength of opinion, as far as respects affirmation without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<p>They accordingly despise and laugh at one another. And it happens that the same thought is held in the highest estimation by some, and by others condemned for insanity. And, indeed, we have learned that voluptuousness, which is to be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, is one thing; and wrangling, which is preferred among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, is another; and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is to be appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, another; and delight, which is to be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, another. And as, if one devote himself to Ischomachus, he will make him a farmer; and to Lampis, a mariner; and to Charidemus, a military commander; and to Simon, an equestrian; and to Perdices, a trader; and to Crobylus, a cook; and to Archelaus, a dancer; and to Homer, a poet; and to Pyrrho, a wrangler; and to Demosthenes, an orator; and to Chrysippus, a dialectician; and to Aristotle, a naturalist; and to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>: so he who listens to the Lord, and follows the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> given by Him, will be formed perfectly in the likeness of the teacher&mdash; made a god going about in flesh. </p>

<p>Accordingly, those fall from this eminence who follow not God whither He leads. And He leads us in the inspired Scriptures.</p>

<p>Though men's actions are ten thousand in number, the sources of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are but two, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and inability. And both depend on ourselves; inasmuch as we will not learn, nor, on the other hand, restrain <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. And of these, the one is that, in consequence of which people do not judge well, and the other that, in consequence of which they cannot comply with right judgments. For neither will one who is deluded in his mind be able to act rightly, though perfectly able to do what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; nor, though capable of judging what is requisite, will he keep himself free of blame, if destitute of power in action. Consequently, then, there are assigned two kinds of correction applicable to both kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for the one, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and clear demonstration from the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and for the other, the training according to the Word, which is regulated by the discipline of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And both develop into perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For the end of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> here is, in my judgment, twofold,&mdash; partly scientific <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, partly action.</p>

<p>Would, then, that these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would learn and be set right by these notes, and turn to the sovereign God! But if, like the deaf serpents, they listen not to the song called new, though very old, may they be chastised by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and undergo paternal admonitions previous to the Judgment, till they become ashamed and repent, but not rush through headlong unbelief, and precipitate themselves into judgment.</p>

<p>For there are partial corrections, which are called chastisements, which many of us who have been in transgression incur, by falling away from the Lord's people. But as children are chastised by their teacher, or their father, so are we by Providence. But God does not punish, for punishment is retaliation for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He chastises, however, for good to those who are chastised, collectively and individually.</p>

<p>I have adduced these things from a wish to avert those, who are eager to learn, from the liability to fall into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and out of a desire to stop them from superficial <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or stupidity, or bad disposition, or whatever it should be called. And in the attempt to persuade and lead to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> those who are not entirely incurable, I have made use of these words. For there are some who cannot bear at all to listen to those who exhort them to turn to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and they attempt to trifle, pouring out <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, claiming for themselves the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the greatest things in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, without having learned, or inquired, or laboured, or discovered the consecutive train of ideas,&mdash; whom one should pity rather than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> for such perversity.</p>

<p>But if one is curable, able to bear (like fire or steel) the outspokenness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which cuts away and burns their false opinions, let him lend the ears of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And this will be the case, unless, through the propensity to sloth, they push <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> away, or through the desire of fame, endeavour to invent novelties. For those are <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> who, having it in their power to provide themselves with proper <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, select only what contributes to their own pleasures. And those have a craving for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> who voluntarily evade, by arguments of a diverse sort, the things delivered by the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and teachers, which are wedded to inspired words; opposing the divine tradition by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teachings, in order to establish the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.  For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what remained to be said&mdash; in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> I mean&mdash; by such men, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, for example, or Prodicus, and such like, who did not walk in the right way? For they could not have surpassed their predecessors in wisdom, so as to discover anything in addition to what had been uttered by them; for they would have been satisfied had they been able to learn the things laid down before.</p>

<p>Our <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> then alone, having grown old in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and maintaining apostolic and ecclesiastic <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in doctrines, lives most correctly in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and discovers the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for which he may have made search (sent forth as he is by the Lord), from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For the life of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, in my view, is nothing but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words corresponding to the tradition of the Lord. But <q>all have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For I would not have you to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren,</q> says the apostle, <q>that all were under the cloud, and partook of spiritual meat and drink;</q>  clearly affirming that all who heard the word did not take in the magnitude of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in deed and word. Wherefore also he added: <q>But with all of them He was not well pleased.</q> Who is this? He who said, <q>Why do you call Me Lord, and do not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father?</q>  That is the Saviour's teaching, which to us is spiritual food, and drink that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no thirst, the water of gnostic life. Further it is said, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is said <q>to puff up.</q> To whom we say: Perchance seeming <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is said to puff up, if one  suppose the expression means <q>to be swollen up.</q> But if, as is rather the case, the expression of the apostle means, <q>to entertain great and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sentiments,</q> the difficulty is solved. Following, then, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let us establish what has been said: <q>Wisdom,</q> says Solomon, <q>has inflated her children.</q> For the Lord did not work conceit by the particulars of His teaching; but He produces trust in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and expansion of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is communicated by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and contempt for the things which drag into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the meaning of the expression <q>inflated.</q> It teaches the magnificence of the wisdom implanted in her children by instruction. Now the apostle says, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the speech of those that are puffed up, but the power;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023684"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:19</a></span> if you understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> magnanimously (which means <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; for nothing is greater than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>). For in that lies the power of the children of wisdom who are puffed up. He says, as it were, I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if you rightly entertain great thoughts respecting <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <q>For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> according to David, <q>is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,</q> that is, those that are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> is interpreted <q>Confession.</q> It is, then, rightly said by the apostle, <q>This <em>You, shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>, You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>;</em> and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in this word, <em>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023685"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;13:9</a></span> </p>

<p>For we must never, as do those who follow the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, adulterate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or steal the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by gratifying our own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and vanity, by defrauding our neighbours; whom above all it is our duty, in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to them, to teach to adhere to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is accordingly expressly said, <q>Declare among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> His statutes,</q> that they may not be judged, but that those who have previously given ear may be converted. But those who speak treacherously with their tongues have the penalties that are on record. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Tradition of the Church Prior to that of the Heresies</h2>

<p>Those, then, that adhere to impious words, and dictate them to others, inasmuch as they do not make a right but a perverse use of the divine words, neither themselves enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, nor permit those whom they have deluded to attain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But not having the key of entrance, but a false (and as the common phrase expresses it), a counterfeit key (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2;</span>), by which they do not enter in as we enter in, through the tradition of the Lord, by drawing aside the curtain; but bursting through the side-door, and digging clandestinely through the wall of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and stepping over the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they constitute themselves the Mystagogues  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the impious.</p>

<p>For that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assemblies which they held were posterior to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  requires not many words to show.</p>

<p>For the teaching of our Lord at His advent, beginning with Augustus and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, was completed in the middle of the times of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>. </p> 

<p>And that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, embracing the ministry of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, ends with <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. It was later, in the times of Adrian the king, that those who invented the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> arose; and they extended to the age of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus the elder</a>, as, for instance, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, though he claims (as they boast) for his master, Glaucias, the interpreter of Peter.</p>

<p>Likewise they allege that <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> was a hearer of Theudas.  And he was the pupil of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who arose in the same age with them, lived as an old man with the younger  [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>]. And after him Simon heard for a little the preaching of Peter.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it is evident, from the high antiquity and perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that these later <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and those yet subsequent to them in time, were new inventions falsified [from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>].</p>

<p>From what has been said, then, it is my opinion that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, that which is really ancient, is one, and that in it those who according to God's purpose are just, are enrolled.  For from the very reason that God is one, and the Lord one, that which is in the highest degree <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> is lauded in consequence of its singleness, being an imitation of the one first principle. In the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the One, then, is associated in a joint heritage the one Church, which they strive to cut asunder into many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore in substance and idea, in origin, in pre-eminence, we say that the ancient and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>  Church is alone, collecting as it does into the unity of the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; which results from the peculiar Testaments, or rather the one Testament in different times by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through one Lord&mdash; those already ordained, whom God <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> before the foundation of the world that they would be righteous.</p>

<p>But the pre-eminence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the principle of union, is, in its oneness, in this surpassing all things else, and having nothing like or equal to itself. But of this afterwards.</p>

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, some receive their appellation from a [person's] name, as that which is called after <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and that after <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and that after <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, although they boast of adducing the opinion of Matthew [without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>]; for as the teaching, so also the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was one. Some take their designation from a place, as the Peratici; some from a nation, as the [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>] of the Phrygians; some from an action, as that of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>; and some from peculiar <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, as that of the Docet&aelig;, and that of the H&aelig;rmatites; and some from suppositions, and from individuals they have honoured, as those called Cainists, and the Ophians; and some from nefarious practices and enormities, as those of the <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a> called Entychites.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Distinction Between Clean and Unclean Animals in the Law Symbolical of the Distinction Between the Church, and Jews, and Heretics</h2>

<p>After showing a little peep-hole to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to contemplate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the law of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> respecting clean and unclean animals (inasmuch as thus the common <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are distinguished <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> from the divine Church), let us bring the discourse to a close.</p>

<p>For such of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> as part the hoof, and ruminate, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> represents as clean and acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since the just obtain access to the Father and to the Son by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For this is the stability of those who part the hoof, those who study the oracles of God night and day, and ruminate them in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> receptacle for instructions; which gnostic exercise the Law expresses under the figure of the rumination of the clean animal. But such as have neither the one nor the other of those qualities it separates as unclean.</p>

<p>Now those that ruminate, but do not part the hoof, indicate the majority of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who have indeed the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the step which, resting on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, conveys to the Father by the Son. Whence also this kind of cattle are apt to slip, not having a division in the foot, and not resting on the twofold support of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <q>no man,</q> it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023694"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> </p>

<p>And again, those also are likewise unclean that part the hoof, but do not ruminate.  For these point out the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who indeed go upon the name of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but are incapable of triturating and grinding down the clear declaration of the oracles, and who, besides, perform the works of righteousness coarsely and not with precision, if they perform them at all. To such the Lord says, <q>Why will you call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note023696"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;6:46</a></span> </p>

<p>And those that neither part the hoof nor chew the cud are entirely unclean.</p> <blockquote><p><q>But you Megareans,</q> says Theognis, <q>are neither third, nor fourth, <br>Nor twelfth, neither in reckoning nor in number,</q></p></blockquote>

<p><q>but as chaff which the wind drives away from the face of the earth,</q>  and as a drop from a vessel. <span class="stiki" id="note023698"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> </p>

<p>These points, then, having been formerly thoroughly treated, and the department of ethics having been sketched summarily in a fragmentary way, as we promised; and having here and there interspersed the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> which are the germs  of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that the discovery of the sacred traditions may not be easy to any one of the uninitiated, let us proceed to what we promised.</p>

<p>Now the Miscellanies are not like parts laid out, planted in regular order for the delight of the eye, but rather like an umbrageous and shaggy hill, planted with laurel, and ivy, and apples, and olives, and figs; the planting being purposely a mixture of fruit-bearing and fruitless trees, since the composition aims at concealment, on account of those that have the daring to pilfer and steal the ripe fruits; from which, however, the husbandmen, transplanting shoots and plants, will adorn a beautiful park and a delightful grove.</p>

<p>The Miscellanies, then, study neither arrangement nor diction; since there are even cases in which the Greeks on purpose wish that ornate diction should be absent, and imperceptibly cast in the seed of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, not according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, rendering such as may read laborious and quick at discovery. For many and various are the baits for the various kinds of fishes.</p>

<p>And now, after this seventh Miscellany of ours, we shall give the account of what follows in order from another commencement. </p>
