<h1>The Teaching of Simon Cephas in Rome</h1>

<p> <em> The Teaching of Simon Cephas  in the City of Rome. </em></p>

<p>In the third  year of Claudius C&aelig;sar, Simon Cephas departed from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And as he passed on he preached in the <em>various</em> countries the word of our Lord. And, when he had nearly arrived there,  many had heard <em>of it</em> and went out to meet him, and the whole church received him with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And some of the princes of the city, wearers of the imperial headbands,  came to him, that they might see him and hear his word. And, when the whole city was gathered together about him, he stood up to speak to them, and to show them the preaching of his doctrine, of what sort it was. And he began to speak to them thus:&mdash; </p>

<p>Men, people of Rome, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, hear ye that which I say to you. This day I preach and proclaim Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who came down from heaven, and became man, and was with us as <em>one of</em> ourselves, and wrought marvellous mighty-works and signs and wonders before us, and before all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are in the land of Palestine. And you yourselves also heard of those things which He did: because they came to Him from other countries also, on account of the fame of His healing and the report of the marvellous help He gave;  and whosoever drew near to Him was healed by His word. And, inasmuch as He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the same time that He healed He also forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for His healing, which was open to view, bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of His hidden forgiveness, that it was real and trustworthy. For this Jesus did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announce in their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> sayings, as they were looking forward to see Him and to hear His word: Him who was with His Father from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and from everlasting; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was hidden in the height, and appeared in the depth; the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Son, who was from His Progenitor, and is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, together with His Father, and His divine Spirit, and the terrible power of His dominion. And He was crucified of His own will by the hands of sinners, and was taken up to His Father, even as I and my companions saw. And He is about to come again, in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and that of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even as we heard Him say to us. For we cannot say anything which was not heard by us from Him, neither do we write in the book of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> anything which He Himself did not say to us: because this word is spoken in order that the mouth of liars may be shut, in the day when men shall give an account of idle words at the place of judgment.</p>

<p>Moreover, because we were catchers of fish,  and not skilled in books, therefore did He also say to us: <q>I will send you the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the Paraclete, that He may teach you that which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not;</q> for it is by <em>His</em> gift that we speak those things which you hear. And, further, by it we bring aid to the sick, and healing to the diseased: that by the hearing of His word and by the aid of His power ye may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and may be delivered from the service of bondage, and may worship Him and His Father, and glorify His divine Spirit. For when we glorify the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we glorify the Son also with Him; and when we worship the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we worship the Father also with Him; and when we confess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, we confess the Father also and the Son: because in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, were we commanded to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that they may live for ever.</p>

<p>Flee therefore from the words of the wisdom of this world, in which there is no profit, and draw near to those which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful, and acceptable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whose reward also is laid up in store, and whose recompense stands <em>sure</em>. Now, too,  the light has arisen on the creation, and the world has obtained the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that every man may see and understand that it is not fit that creatures should be worshipped instead of the Creator, nor together with the Creator: because everything which is a creature is <em>made to be</em> a worshipper of its Maker, and is not to be worshipped like its Creator. But this <em>One</em> who came to us is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in His own nature, notwithstanding that He mingled  His Godhead with our manhood, in order that He might renew our manhood by the aid of His Godhead. And on this account it is right that we should worship Him, because He is to be worshipped together with His Father, and that we should not worship creatures, who were created for the worship of the Creator. For He is Himself the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and verity; He is Himself from before <em>all</em> worlds and creatures; He is Himself the veritable Son, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fruit  which is from the exalted Father.</p>

<p>But ye see the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> which accompany and follow these words. One would not credit it: the time lo! Is short since He ascended to His Father, and see how His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has winged its flight through the whole creation&mdash; that thereby it may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He Himself is the Creator of creatures, and that by His bidding creatures subsist. And, whereas ye saw the sun become darkened at His death, you yourselves also are witnesses. The earth, moreover, quaked when He was slain, and the veil was rent at His death. And concerning these things the governor <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> also was <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: for he himself sent and made them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to C&aelig;sar,  and these things, and more than these, were read before him, and before the princes of your city. And on this account C&aelig;sar was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> because he had <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> listened to the persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and for this reason he sent and took away from him the authority which he had given to him. And this same thing was published and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in all the dominion of the Romans. That, therefore, which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saw and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to C&aelig;sar and to your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> senate, the same do I preach and declare, as do also my fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> could not have written to the imperial government of that which did not take place and which he had not seen with his own eyes; but that which did take place and was actually done&mdash; this it was that he wrote and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Moreover, the watchers of the sepulchre also were witnesses of those things which took place there: they became as dead men; and, when those watchers were questioned before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, they confessed before him how large a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> the chief-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had given them, so that they might say that we His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had stolen the corpse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Lo! Then, you have heard many things; and moreover, if you be not willing to be persuaded by those things which you have heard, be at least persuaded by the mighty-works which you see, which are done by His name.</p>

<p>Let not Simon the sorcerer delude you by semblances which are not realities, which he exhibits to you, as to men who have no understanding, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to discern that which they see and hear. Send, therefore, and fetch him to where all your city is assembled together, and choose you some sign for us to do before you; and, whichever ye see do that same sign, it will be your part to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it.</p>

<p>And immediately they sent and fetched Simon the sorcerer;  and the men who were adherents of his opinion said to him: As a man concerning whom we have confidence that there is power in you to do anything whatsoever,  do some sign before us all, and let this Simon the Galil&aelig;an, who preaches Christ, see <em>it</em>. And, while they were thus speaking to him, there happened to be passing along a dead person, a son of one of those who were chiefs and men of note and renown among them. And all of them, as they were assembled together, said to him: Whichever of you shall restore to life this dead person, he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in and received, and we will all follow him in whatsoever he says to us. And they said to Simon the sorcerer: Because you were here before Simon the Galil&aelig;an, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you before him, exhibit first the power which accompanies you. </p>

<p>Then Simon reluctantly drew near to the dead person; and they set down the bier before him; and he looked to the right hand and to the left, and gazed up into heaven, saying many words: some of them he uttered aloud, and some of them secretly and not aloud. And he delayed a long while, and nothing took place, and nothing was done, and the dead person was lying upon his bier.</p>

<p>And immediately Simon Cephas drew near boldly towards the dead man, and cried aloud before all the assembly which was standing there: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> crucified at Jerusalem, and whom we preach, rise up thence. And as soon as the word of Simon was spoken the dead man came to life and rose up from the bier.</p>

<p>And all the people saw and marvelled; and they said to Simon: Christ, whom you preach, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And many cried out, and said: Let Simon the sorcerer and the deceiver of us all be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. But Simon, by reason that every one was running to see the dead man that had come to life, escaped from them from one street to another and from house to house, and fell not into their hands on that day.</p>

<p>But the whole city took hold of Simon Cephas, and they received him gladly and affectionately; and he ceased not from doing signs and wonders in the name of Christ; and many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him. Cuprinus,  moreover, the father of him that was restored to life, took Simon with him to his house, and entertained him in a suitable manner, while he and all his household <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He is the Son of the living God. And many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> became <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> there. And, when there was great rejoicing at his teaching, he built churches there, in Rome and in the cities round about, and in all the villages of the people of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and he served there <em>in</em> the rank of the Superintendence of Rulers twenty-five years. </p>

<p>And after these years <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> C&aelig;sar seized him and shut him up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would crucify him; so he called Ansus,  the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his stead in Rome. And these things did Simon himself speak; and moreover also the rest, the other things which he had <em>in charge</em>, he commanded Ansus to teach before the people, saying to him: Beside the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the Old let there not be read before the people  anything else:  which is not right.</p>

<p>And, when C&aelig;sar had commanded that Simon should be crucified with his head downwards, as he himself had requested of C&aelig;sar, and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> head should be taken off, there was great commotion among the people, and bitter distress in all the church, seeing that they were deprived of the sight of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And Isus the guide arose and took up their bodies by night, and buried them with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and there came to be a gathering-place there for many.</p>

<p>And at that very time, as if by a righteous judgment, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> abandoned his empire and fled, and there was a cessation for a little while from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> C&aelig;sar had raised against them. And many years after the great coronation  of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who had departed out of the world, while ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was proceeding both in all Rome and in all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, it happened then that there was a great famine in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </p>

<p>Here ends the teaching of Simon Cephas.</p>
