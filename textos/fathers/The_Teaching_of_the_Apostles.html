<h1>The Teaching of the Apostles</h1>


<p>At that time Christ was taken up to His Father; and how the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> received the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and the Ordinances and Laws of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and whither each one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> went; and from whence the countries in the territory of the Romans received the ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<p>In the year three hundred and  thirty-nine of the kingdom of the Greeks, in the month Heziran,  on the fourth  day of the same, which is the first day of the week, and the end of Pentecost &mdash; on the selfsame day came the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, where the conception of our Lord was announced, to the mount which is called that of the Place of Olives,  our Lord being with them, but not being visible to them. And at the time of early dawn our Lord lifted up His hands, and laid them upon the heads of the eleven <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and gave to them the gift of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. And suddenly a bright cloud received Him. And they saw Him as He was going up to heaven. And He sat down on the right hand of His Father. And they praised God because they saw His ascension according as He had told them; and they rejoiced because they had received the Right Hand conferring on them the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.</p>

<p>And from thence they went up <em>to the city</em>, and  proceeded to an upper room&mdash; that in which our Lord had observed the passover with them, and the place where the inquiries had been made: Who it was that should betray our Lord to the crucifiers? There also were <em>made</em> the inquiries:  How they should preach His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the world? And, as within the upper room the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the body and of the blood of our Lord began to prevail in the world, so also from thence did the teaching of His preaching begin to have authority in the world.</p>

<p>And, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were cast into this perplexity, how they should preach His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to <em>men of</em> strange tongues  which were unknown to them, and were speaking thus to one another: Although we are confident that Christ will perform by our hands mighty works and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the presence of strange peoples whose tongues we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, and who themselves also are unversed in our tongue, <em>yet</em> who shall teach them and make them understand that it is by the name of Christ who was crucified that these mighty works and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are done?&mdash; while, I say, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were occupied with these thoughts, Simon Cephas rose up, and said to them: My brethren, this matter, how we shall preach His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, pertains not to us, but to our Lord; for <em>He</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how it is possible for us to preach His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the world; and we rely on His care for us, which He promised us, saying: <q>When I am ascended to my Father I will send you the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the Paraclete, that <em>He</em> may teach you everything which it is meet for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q></p>

<p>And, while Simon Cephas was saying these things to his fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and putting them in remembrance, a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> voice was heard by them, and a sweet odour, which was strange to the world, breathed upon them;  and tongues of fire, between the voice and the odour, came down from heaven  towards them, and alighted and sat on every one of them; and, according to the tongue which every one of them had severally received, so did he prepare himself to go to the country in which that tongue was spoken and heard.</p>

<p>And, by the same gift of the Spirit which was given to them on that day, they appointed Ordinances and Laws&mdash; such as were in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of their preaching, and with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful doctrine of their teaching:&mdash; </p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> therefore appointed: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye towards the east:  because, <q>as the lightning which lightens from the east and is seen even to the west, so shall the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note083066"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;24:27</a></span> that by this we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and understand that He will appear from the east suddenly. </p>

<p>2. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: On the first <em>day</em> of the week let there be service, and the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and the oblation:  because on the first day of the week our Lord rose from the place of the dead and on the first day of the week He arose upon the world, and on the first day of the week He ascended up to heaven, and on the first day of the week He will appear at last with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven. </p>

<p>3. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: On the fourth  day of the week let there be service: because on that <em>day</em> our Lord made the disclosure to them about His trial,  and His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, and His crucifixion, and His death, and His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were on account of this in sorrow. </p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: On the eve <em>of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></em>,  at the ninth hour, let there be service: because that which had been spoken on the fourth day of the week about the suffering of the Saviour was brought to pass on the <em>same</em> eve; the worlds and creatures trembling, and the luminaries in the heavens being darkened.</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Let there be elders and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>;  and subdeacons,  like those who carried the vessels of the court of the sanctuary of the Lord; and an overseer,  who shall likewise be the Guide of all the people,  like <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, the head and chief of all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> of the whole city. </p>

<p>6. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Celebrate the day of the Epiphany  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, which is the chief of the festivals of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the sixth day of the latter Canun,  in the long number of the Greeks. </p>

<p>7. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Forty  days before the day of the passion of our Saviour fast ye, and then celebrate the day of the passion, and the day of the resurrection: because our Lord Himself also, the Lord of the festival, fasted forty days; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, who were endued with this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, likewise each fasted forty days, and then were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</p>

<p>8. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: At the conclusion of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <em>other</em> let the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> be read, as being the seal  of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and let the people listen to it standing upon their feet: because it is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the redemption of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>9. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: At the completion of fifty  days after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> make ye a commemoration of His ascension to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Father.</p>

<p>10. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> appointed: That, beside the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and the Prophets, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the Acts (of their exploits), nothing should be read on the pulpit in the church. </p>

<p>11. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Whosoever is unacquainted with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the ordinances and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which are appointed in it, let him not be a guide and ruler; and whosoever is acquainted with them and departs from them, let him not minister again: because, not being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in his ministry, he has lied.</p>

<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Whosoever swears, or  lies, or bears false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, or has recourse to magicians and soothsayers and Chaldeans, and puts confidence in fates and nativities, which they hold fast who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;let him also, as a man that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be dismissed from the ministry, and not minister <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>13. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: If there be any man that is divided <em>in mind</em> touching the ministry, and who follows it not with a steadfast will , let not this man minister again: because the Lord of the ministry is not served by him with a steadfast will; and he deceives man <em>only</em>, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>before whom crafty devices avail not.</q> </p>

<p>14. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Whosoever lends and receives <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>,  and is occupied in merchandise and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let not this man minister again, nor continue in the ministry.</p>

<p>15. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: That whosoever loves the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  like Iscariot, who was their friend, or the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, who worship creatures instead of the Creator,&mdash; should not enter in among them and minister; and moreover, that if he be <em>already</em> among them, they should not suffer him <em>to remain</em>, but that he should be separated from among them, and not minister with them again.</p>

<p>16. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: That, if any one from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> come and join himself with them, and if after he has joined himself with them he turn and go back again to the side on which he stood <em>before</em>, and if he again return and come to them a second time,&mdash; he should not be received again; but that, according to the side on which he was before, so those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him should look upon him.</p>

<p>17. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: That it should not be permitted to the Guide to transact the matters which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> apart from those who minister with him; but that he should issue commands with the counsel of them all, and that that <em>only</em> should be done which all of them should concur in and not disapprove. </p>

<p>18. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Whenever any shall depart out of this world with a good testimony to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with affliction <em>borne</em> for His name's sake, make ye a commemoration of them on the day on which they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. </p>

<p>19. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: In the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> repeat ye the praises of David day by day: because of this <em>saying</em>: <q>I will bless the Lord at all times, and at all times His praises <em>shall be</em> in my mouth;</q>  and <em>this:</em> <q>By day and by night will I meditate and speak, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> my voice to be heard before You.</q></p>

<p>20. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: If any divest themselves of <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> and run not after the gain of money, let these men be chosen and admitted to the ministry of the altar.</p>

<p>21. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Let any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who accidentally puts <em>another</em> in bonds  contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> receive the punishment that is right; and let him that has been bound receive the bonds as if he had been equitably bound.</p>

<p>22. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: If it be seen that those who are accustomed to hear causes show partiality, and pronounce the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent, let them never again hear another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: <em>thus</em> receiving the rebuke of their partiality, as it is fit. </p>

<p>23. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further ordained: Let not those that are high-minded and lifted up with the arrogance of boasting be admitted to the ministry: because of this <em>text:</em> <q>That which is exalted among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is abominable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and because concerning them it is said: <q>I will return a recompense upon those that vaunt themselves.</q></p>

<p>24. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Let there be a Ruler over the elders who are in the villages, and let him be recognised as head of them all, at whose hand all of them shall be required: for Samuel also thus made visits from place to place and ruled. </p>

<p>25. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: That those kings who shall hereafter <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ should be permitted to go up and stand before the altar along with the Guides of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: because David also, and those who were like him, went up and stood before the altar. </p>

<p>26. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Let no man dare to do anything by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which is not in accordance with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and equity, but in accordance with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and free from the blame of partiality, <em>let all things be done</em>.</p>

<p>27. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> further appointed: Let the bread of the Oblation be placed upon the altar on the day on which it is baked, and not some days after&mdash; a thing which is not permitted.</p>

<p>All these things did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> appoint, not for themselves, but for those who should come after them&mdash; for they were apprehensive that in time to come wolves would put on sheep's clothing: since for themselves the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the Paraclete, which was in them, was sufficient: that, even as He had appointed these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by their hands, <em>so</em> He would guide them lawfully. For they, who had received from our Lord power and authority, had no need that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> should be appointed for them by others. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, and Timothy,  while they were going from place to place in the country of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia, committed these same Commands and Laws of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders to those who were under the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, for the churches of the countries in which they were preaching and publishing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, moreover, after they had appointed these Ordinances and Laws, ceased not from the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or from the wonderful mighty-works which our Lord did by their hands. For much people was gathered about them every day, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ; and they came to them from other cities, and heard their words and received them. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> also, and <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, used to come to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in secret, agreeing with their teaching. Judas, moreover, and Levi, and Peri, and Joseph, and Justus, sons of Hananias, and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>  and Alexander the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>&mdash; they too used to come to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by night, confessing Christ that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but they were afraid of the people of their own nation, so that they did not disclose their mind toward the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> received them affectionately, saying to them: Do not, by reason of the shame and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, forfeit your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor have the blood of Christ required of you; even as your fathers, who took it upon them: for it is not acceptable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, while you are, <em>in secret</em>, with His worshippers, you should go and associate with the murderers of His adorable Son. How do ye expect that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be accepted with those that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, while you are with those that are false? But it becomes you, as men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to confess openly this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we preach. </p>

<p>And, when they heard these things from the Disciples, those sons of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, all of them alike, cried out before the whole company of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: We confess and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ who was crucified, and we confess that He is from everlasting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and those who dared to crucify Him do we renounce. For even the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the people in secret confess Christ; but, for the sake of the headship among the people which they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, they are not willing to confess openly; and they have forgotten that which is written:  <q>Of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is He the Lord, and before Him avail not crafty devices.</q></p>

<p>And, when their fathers heard these things from their sons, they became exceedingly hostile to them: not indeed because they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but because they had declared and spoken openly of the mind of their fathers before the sons of their people.</p>

<p>But those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> clove to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and departed not from them, because they saw that, whatsoever they taught the multitude, they themselves carried into practice before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and, when affliction and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose against the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, they rejoiced to be afflicted with them, and received with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> stripes and imprisonment for the confession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ; and all the days of their life they preached Christ before the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>.</p>

<p>And after the death of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> there were Guides and Rulers  in the churches; and, whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had committed to them and they had received from them, they continued to teach to the multitude through the whole space of their lives. They too, again, at their deaths committed and delivered to their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them whatsoever they had received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; also what James had written from Jerusalem, and Simon from the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and John from Ephesus, and Mark from <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> the Great, and Andrew from Phrygia, and Luke from Macedonia, and Judas Thomas from India:  that the epistles of an apostle  might be received and read in the churches that were in every place, just as the achievements of their Acts, which Luke wrote, are read; that hereby the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New;  that <em>so might be seen</em> one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was proclaimed in them all: that one Spirit spoke in them all, from one God whom they had all worshipped and had all preached. And the <em>various</em> countries received their teaching. Everything, therefore, which had been spoken by our Lord by means of the apostles,  and which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had delivered to their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and received in every country, by the operation  of our Lord, who said to them: <q>I am with you, even until the world shall end;</q> the Guides disputing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and contending also against the deluded <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> with the terrible mighty-works which they did in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For all the peoples, even those that dwell in other countries, quietly and silently received  the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ; and those who became confessors cried out under their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>: This our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> today shall plead  on our behalf, <em>lest we be punished</em>, for having been formerly persecutors <em>ourselves</em>. For there were some of them against whom death by the sword was ordered; and there were some of them from whom they took away whatsoever they possessed, and let them go.  And the more affliction arose against them, the richer and larger did their congregations become; and with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in their hearts did they receive death of every kind. And by ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves had received from our Lord, did their <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> wing its way rapidly into the four quarters of the world. And by mutual visitation they ministered to one another.</p>

<p>1. Jerusalem received the ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, as did all the country of Palestine, and the parts occupied by the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, and the parts occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and the country of the Arabians, and of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and the people of C&aelig;sarea, from James, who was ruler and guide in the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> which was built in Zion.</p>

<p>2. Alexandria the Great, and Thebais, and the whole of Inner <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and all the country of Pelusium,  and <em>extending</em> as far as the borders of the Indians, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Mark the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, who was ruler and guide there in the church which he had built, <em>in which</em>, he also ministered.</p>

<p>3. India,  and all the countries belonging to it and round about it, even to the farthest sea, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Judas Thomas, who was guide and ruler in the church which he had built there, <em>in which</em> he also ministered there.</p>

<p>4. <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Cilicia, and Galatia, even to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Simon Cephas, who himself laid the foundation of the church there,  and was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and ministered there up to the time when he went up from thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on account of Simon the sorcerer, who was deluding the people of Rome with his sorceries. </p>

<p>5. The city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and Britain, and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, together with all the rest of the countries round about them, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Simon Cephas, who went up from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; and he was ruler and guide there, in the church which he had built there, and in the places round about it. </p>

<p>6. Ephesus, and Thessalonica, and all Asia, and all the country of the Corinthians, and of all Achaia and the parts round about it, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, who had leaned upon the bosom of our Lord; who himself built a church there, and ministered in his office of Guide which <em>he held</em> there.</p>

<p>7. Nic&aelig;a, and <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and all the country of Bithynia, and of Inner Galatia,  and of the regions round about it, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Andrew, the brother of Simon Cephas, who was himself Guide and Ruler in the church which he had built there, and was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and ministered there.</p>

<p>8. Byzantium, and all the country of Thrace, and of the parts about it as far as the great river,  the boundary which separates from the barbarians, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Luke the apostle, who himself built a church there, and ministered there in his office of Ruler and Guide which <em>he held</em> there.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and all the countries round about it which were on all sides of it, and Zoba,  and Arabia, and all the north, and the regions round about it, and the south, and all the regions on the borders of Mesopotamia, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Add&aelig;us the apostle, one of the seventy-two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  who himself made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> there, and built a church there, and was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and ministered there in his office of Guide which <em>he held</em> there.</p>

<p>10. The whole of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and of the Armenians, and of the Medians, and of the countries round about <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, the Huzites and the Gel&aelig;, as far as the borders of the Indians, and as far as the land  of Gog and Magog, and moreover all the countries on all sides, received the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Agg&aelig;us, a maker of silks,  the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Add&aelig;us the apostle.</p>

<p>The other remaining companions of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, moreover went to the distant countries of the barbarians; and they made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from place to place and passed on; and there they ministered by their preaching; and there occurred their departure out of this world, their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them going on <em>with the work</em> down to the present day, nor was any change or addition made by them in their preaching.</p>

<p>Luke, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> had such diligence that he wrote the exploits of the Acts of the Apostles, and the ordinances and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the ministry of their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and whither each one of them went. By his diligence, I say, did Luke write these things, and more than these; and he placed them in the hand of Priscus  and Aquilus, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and they accompanied him up to the day of his death, just as Timothy and Erastus of Lystra, and Menaus,  the first <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, accompanied <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> until he was taken up to the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> because he had withstood Tertullus the orator. </p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> C&aelig;sar dispatched with the sword Simon Cephas in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </p>
