<h1>The Testament of Abraham</h1>

<h2>Version 1</h2>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> lived the measure of his life, nine hundred and ninety-five years, and having lived all the years of his life in quietness, gentleness, and righteousness, the righteous one was exceeding hospitable; for, pitching his tent in the cross-ways at the oak of Mamre, he received every one, both rich and poor, kings and rulers, the maimed and the helpless, friends and strangers, neighbors and travelers, all alike did the devout, all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, righteous, and hospitable <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> entertain. Even upon him, however, there came the common, inexorable, bitter lot of death, and the uncertain end of life. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, summoning his archangel Michael, said to him: Go down, chief-captain  Michael, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and speak to him concerning his death, that he may set his affairs in order, for I have blessed him as the stars of heaven, and as the sand by the sea-shore, and he is in abundance of long life and many possessions, and is becoming exceeding rich. Beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, moreover, he is righteous in every goodness, hospitable and loving to the end of his life; but go, archangel Michael, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, my beloved friend, and announce to him his death and assure him thus: You shall at this time depart from this vain world, and shall quit the body, and go to your own Lord among the good.</p>

<p>2. And the chief-captain departed from before the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and went down to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to the oak of Mamre, and found the righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the field close by, sitting beside yokes of oxen for ploughing, together with the sons of Masek and other servants, to the number of twelve. And behold the chief-captain came to him, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, seeing the chief-captain Michael coming from afar, like to a very comely warrior, arose and met him as was his custom, meeting and entertaining all strangers. And the chief-captain saluted him and said: Hail, most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> father, righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of the heavenly one. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the chief-captain: Hail, most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> warrior, bright as the sun and most beautiful above all the sons of men; you are welcome; therefore I beseech your presence, tell me whence the youth of your age has come; teach me, your suppliant, whence and from what army and from what journey your beauty has come hither. The chief-captain said: I, O righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, come from the great city. I have been sent by the great king to take the place of a good friend of his, for the king has summoned him. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Come, my Lord, go with me as far as my field. The chief-captain said: I come; and going into the field of the ploughing, they sat down beside the company. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to his servants, the sons of Masek: Go to the herd of horses, and bring two horses, quiet, and gentle and tame, so that I and this stranger may sit thereon. But the chief-captain said, Nay, my Lord, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, let them not bring horses, for I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. Is not my king rich in much merchandise, having power both over men and all kinds of cattle? But I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. Let us go, then, O righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, walking lightly until we reach your house. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, be it so.</p>

<p>3. And as they went on from the field toward his house, beside that way there stood a cypress tree, and by the command of the Lord the tree cried out with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, saying, Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is the Lord God that calls himself to those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him; but <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> hid the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, thinking that the chief-captain had not heard the voice of the tree. And coming near to the house they sat down in the court, and Isaac seeing the face of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Sarah his mother, My lady mother, behold, the man sitting with my father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is not a son of the race of those that dwell on the earth. And Isaac ran, and saluted him, and fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and the Incorporeal blessed him and said, The Lord God will grant you his promise that he made to your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed, and will also grant you the precious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of your father and your mother. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Isaac his son, My son Isaac, draw water from the well, and bring it me in the vessel, that we may wash the feet of this stranger, for he is tired, having come to us from off a long journey. And Isaac ran to the well and drew water in the vessel and brought it to them, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went up and washed the feet of the chief captain Michael, and the heart of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was moved, and he wept over the stranger. And Isaac, seeing his father weeping, wept also, and the chief captain, seeing them weeping, also wept with them, and the tears of the chief captain fell upon the vessel into the water of the basin and became precious stones. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seeing the marvel, and being astonished, took the stones secretly, and hid the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, keeping it by himself in his heart.</p>

<p>4. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Isaac his son: Go, my beloved son, into the inner chamber of the house and beautify it. Spread for us there two couches, one for me and one for this man that is guest with us this day. Prepare for us there a seat and a candlestick and a table with abundance of every good thing. Beautify the chamber, my son, and spread under us linen and purple and fine linen. Burn there every precious and excellent <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and bring sweet-smelling plants from the garden and fill our house with them. Kindle seven lamps full of oil, so that we may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, for this man that is our guest this day is more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than kings or rulers, and his appearance surpasses all the sons of men. And Isaac prepared all things well, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> taking the archangel Michael went into the chamber, and they both sat down upon the couches, and between them he placed a table with abundance of every good thing. Then the chief captain arose and went out, as if by constraint of his belly to make issue of water, and ascended to heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before the Lord, and said to him: Lord and Master, let your power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am unable to remind that righteous man of his death, for I have not seen upon the earth a man like him, pitiful, hospitable, righteous, truthful, devout, refraining from every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>. And now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Lord, that I cannot remind him of his death. And the Lord said: Go down, chief-captain Michael, to my friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and do whatever he says to you, and eat with him whatever he eats. And I will send my <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon his son Isaac, and will put the remembrance of his death into the heart of Isaac, so that even he in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> may see the death of his father, and Isaac will relate the dream, and you shall interpret it, and he himself will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his end. And the chief-captain said, Lord, all the heavenly spirits are incorporeal, and neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before me a table with abundance of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things earthly and corruptible. Now, Lord, what shall I do? How shall I escape him, sitting at one table with him? The Lord said: Go down to him, and take no thought for this, for when you sit down with him, I will send upon you a devouring spirit, and it will consume out of your hands and through your mouth all that is on the table. Rejoice together with him in everything, only you shall interpret well the things of the vision, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sickle of death and the uncertain end of life, and may make disposal of all his possessions, for I have blessed him above the sand of the sea and as the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>5. Then the chief captain went down to the house of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and sat down with him at the table, and Isaac served them. And when the supper was ended, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> after his custom, and the chief-captain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> together with him, and each lay down to sleep upon his couch. And Isaac said to his father, Father, I too would fain sleep with you in this chamber, that I also may hear your discourse, for I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to hear the excellence of the conversation of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Nay, my son, but go to your own chamber and sleep on your own couch, lest we be troublesome to this man. Then Isaac, having received the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from them, and having blessed them, went to his own chamber and lay down upon his couch. But the Lord cast the thought of death into the heart of Isaac as in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the night Isaac awoke and rose up from his couch, and came running to the chamber where his father was sleeping together with the archangel. Isaac, therefore, on reaching the door cried out, saying, My father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, arise and open to me quickly, that I may enter and hang upon your neck, and embrace you before they take you away from me. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> therefore arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his neck, and began to weep with a loud voice. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> therefore being moved at heart, also wept with a loud voice, and the chief-captain, seeing them weeping, wept also. Sarah being in her room, heard their weeping, and came running to them, and found them embracing and weeping. And Sarah said with weeping, My Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, what is this that you weep? Tell me, my Lord, has this brother that has been entertained by us this day brought you tidings of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, your brother's son, that he is dead? Is it for this that you grieve thus? The chief-captain answered and said to her, Nay, my sister Sarah, it is not as you say, but your son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, and came to us weeping, and we seeing him were moved in our hearts and wept.</p>

<p>6.  Then Sarah, hearing the excellence of the conversation of the chief-captain, straightway <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord that spoke. Sarah therefore signified to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to come out towards the door, and said to him, My Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, do you know who this man is? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Sarah said, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, my Lord, the three men from heaven that were entertained by us in our tent beside the oak of Mamre, when you killed the kid without blemish, and set a table before them. After the flesh had been eaten, the kid rose again, and sucked its mother with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, my Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that by promise they gave to us Isaac as the fruit of the womb? Of these three <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men this is one. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, O Sarah, in this you speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Glory and praise from our God and the Father. For late in the evening when I washed his feet in the basin I said in my heart, These are the feet of one of the three men that I washed then; and his tears that fell into the basin then became precious stones. And shaking them out from his lap he gave them to Sarah, saying, If you believe me not, look now at these. And Sarah receiving them bowed down and saluted and said, Glory be to God that shows us wonderful things. And now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, my Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that there is among us the revelation of some thing, whether it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or good!</p>

<p>7. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> left Sarah, and went into the chamber, and said to Isaac, Come hither, my beloved son, tell me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what it was you saw and what befell you that you came so hastily to us. And Isaac answering began to say, I saw, my Lord, in this night the sun and the moon above my head, surrounding me with its rays and giving me light. As I gazed at this and rejoiced, I saw the heaven opened, and a man bearing light descend from it, shining more than seven suns. And this man like the sun came and took away the sun from my head, and went up into the heavens from whence he came, but I was greatly grieved that he took away the sun from me. After a little, as I was still sorrowing and sore troubled, I saw this man come forth from heaven a second time, and he took away from me the moon also from off my head, and I wept greatly and called upon that man of light, and said, Do not, my Lord, take away my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from me; pity me and hear me, and if you take away the sun from me, then leave the moon to me. He said, Suffer them to be taken up to the king above, for he wishes them there. And he took them away from me, but he left the rays upon me. The chief-captain said, Hear, O righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; the sun which your son saw is you his father, and the moon likewise is Sarah his mother. The man bearing light who descended from heaven, this is the one sent from God who is to take your righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from you. And now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that at this time you shall leave this worldly life, and remove to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the chief captain O strangest of marvels! And now are you he that shall take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from me? The chief-captain said to him, I am the chief-captain Michael, that stands before the Lord, and I was sent to you to remind you of your death, and then I shall depart to him as I was commanded. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, and wast sent to take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but I will not go with you; but do whatever you are commanded.</p>

<p>8. The chief-captain hearing these words immediately vanished, and ascending into heaven stood before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and told all that he had seen in the house of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and the chief-captain said this also to his Lord, Thus says your friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, I will not go with you, but do whatever you are commanded; and now, O Lord Almighty, does your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> kingdom order anything? God said to the chief-captain Michael, Go to my friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> yet once again, and speak to him thus, Thus says the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he that brought you into the land of promise, that blessed you above the sand of the sea and above the stars of heaven, that opened the womb of barrenness of Sarah, and granted you Isaac as the fruit of the womb in old age, Verily I say unto you that blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed, and I will give you all that you shall ask from me, for I am the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and besides me there is no other. Tell me why you have rebelled against me, and why there is grief in you, and why you rebelled against my archangel Michael? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that all who have come from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> have died, and that none of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> has escaped death? None of those that rule as kings is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; none of your forefathers has escaped the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of death. They have all died, they have all departed into Hades, they are all gathered by the sickle of death. But upon you I have not sent death, I have not suffered any deadly disease to come upon you, I have not permitted the sickle of death to meet you, I have not allowed the nets of Hades to enfold you, I have never wished you to meet with any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But for good comfort I have sent my chief-captain Michael to you, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your departure from the world, and set your house in order, and all that belongs to you, and bless Isaac your beloved son. And now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have done this not wishing to grieve you. Wherefore then have you said to my chief-captain, I will not go with you? Wherefore have you spoken thus? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that if I give leave to death and he comes upon you, then I should see whether you would come or not?</p>

<p>9. And the chief-captain receiving the exhortations of the Lord went down to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and seeing him the righteous one fell upon his face to the ground as one dead, and the chief-captain told him all that he had heard from the Most High. Then the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rising with many tears fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and besought him, saying, I beseech you, chief-captain of the hosts above, since you have wholly deigned to come yourself to me a sinner and in all things your unworthy servant, I beseech you even now, O chief-captain, to carry my word yet again to the Most High, and you shall say to him, Thus says <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your servant, Lord, Lord, in every work and word which I have asked of you you have heard me, and hast fulfilled all my counsel. Now, Lord, I resist not your power, for I too <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> but mortal. Since therefore to your command all things yield, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and tremble at the face of your power, I also <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but I ask one request of you, and now, Lord and Master, hear my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for while still in this body I desire to see all the inhabited earth, and all the creations which you established by one word, and when I see these, then if I shall depart from life I shall be without sorrow. So the chief-captain went back again, and stood before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and told him all, saying, Thus says your friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, I desired to behold all the earth in my lifetime before I died. And the Most High hearing this, again commanded the chief-captain Michael, and said to him, Take a cloud of light, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that have power over the chariots, and go down, take the righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> upon a chariot of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and exalt him into the air of heaven that he may behold all the earth.</p>

<p>10. And the archangel Michael went down and took <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> upon a chariot of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and exalted him into the air of heaven, and led him upon the cloud together with sixty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> ascended upon the chariot over all the earth. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw the world as it was in that day, some ploughing, others driving wains, in one place men herding flocks, and in another watching them by night, and dancing and playing and harping, in another place men striving and contending at law, elsewhere men weeping and having the dead in remembrance. He saw also the newly-wedded received with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and in a word he saw all things that are done in the world, both good and bad. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> therefore passing over them saw men bearing swords, wielding in their hands sharpened swords, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> asked the chief-captain, Who are these? The chief-captain said, These are thieves, who intend to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and to steal and burn and destroy. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Lord, Lord, hear my voice, and command that wild beasts may come out of the wood and devour them. And even as he spoke there came wild beasts out of the wood and devoured them. And he saw in another place a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> committing fornication with each other, and said, Lord, Lord, command that the earth may open and swallow them, and straightway the earth was cleft and swallowed them. And he saw in another place men digging through a house, and carrying away other men's possessions, and he said, Lord, Lord, command that fire may come down from heaven and consume them. And even as he spoke, fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And straightway there came a voice from heaven to the chief-captain, saying thus, O chief-captain Michael, command the chariot to stop, and turn <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> away that he may not see all the earth, for if he behold all that live in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, he will destroy all creation. For behold, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and has no pity on sinners, but I have made the world, and desire not to destroy any one of them, but wait for the death of the sinner, till he be converted and live. But take <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> up to the first gate of heaven, that he may see there the judgments and recompenses, and repent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the sinners that he has destroyed.</p>

<p>11. So Michael turned the chariot and brought <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to the east, to the first gate of heaven; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw two ways, the one narrow and contracted, the other broad and spacious, and there he saw two gates, the one broad on the broad way, and the other narrow on the narrow way. And outside the two gates there he saw a man sitting upon a gilded throne, and the appearance of that man was terrible, as of the Lord.  And they saw many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> driven by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and led in through the broad gate, and other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, few in number, that were taken by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through the narrow gate. And when the wonderful one who sat upon the golden throne saw few entering through the narrow gate, and many entering through the broad one, straightway that wonderful one tore the hairs of his head and the sides of his beard, and threw himself on the ground from his throne, weeping and lamenting. But when he saw many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> entering through the narrow gate, then he arose from the ground and sat upon his throne in great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, rejoicing and exulting. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> asked the chief-captain, My Lord chief-captain, who is this most marvelous man, adorned with such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and sometimes he weeps and laments, and sometimes he rejoices and exults? The incorporeal one said: This is the first-created <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who is in such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and he looks upon the world because all are born from him, and when he sees many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> going through the narrow gate, then he arises and sits upon his throne rejoicing and exulting in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because this narrow gate is that of the just, that leads to life, and they that enter through it go into Paradise. For this, then, the first-created <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> rejoices, because he sees the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being saved. But when he sees many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> entering through the broad gate, then he pulls out the hairs of his head, and casts himself on the ground weeping and lamenting bitterly, for the broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to destruction and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. And for this the first-formed <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> falls from his throne weeping and lamenting for the destruction of sinners, for they are many that are lost, and they are few that are saved, for in seven thousand there is scarcely found one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> saved, being righteous and undefiled.</p>

<p>12. While he was yet saying these things to me, behold two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, fiery in aspect, and pitiless in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and severe in look, and they drove on thousands of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, pitilessly lashing them with fiery thongs. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> laid hold of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and they drove all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in at the broad gate to destruction. So we also went along with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and came within that broad gate, and between the two gates stood a throne terrible of aspect, of terrible crystal, gleaming as fire, and upon it sat a wondrous man bright as the sun, like to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Before him stood a table like crystal, all of gold and fine linen, and upon the table there was lying a book, the thickness of it six cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits, and on the right and left of it stood two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> holding paper and ink and pen. Before the table sat an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, holding in his hand a balance, and on his left sat an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> all fiery, pitiless, and severe, holding in his hand a trumpet, having within it all-consuming fire with which to try the sinners. The wondrous man who sat upon the throne himself judged and sentenced the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on the right and on the left wrote down, the one on the right the righteousness and the one on the left the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. The one before the table, who held the balance, weighed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the fiery <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who held the fire, tried the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> asked the chief-captain Michael, What is this that we behold? And the chief-captain said, These things that you see, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are the judgment and recompense. And behold the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> holding the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in his hand, and he brought it before the judge, and the judge said to one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that served him, Open me this book, and find me the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And opening the book he found its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and its righteousness equally balanced, and he neither gave it to the tormentors, nor to those that were saved, but set it in the midst.</p>

<p>13. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, My Lord chief-captain, who is this most wondrous judge? And who are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that write down? And who is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> like the sun, holding the balance? And who is the fiery <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> holding the fire? The chief-captain said, <q>Do you see, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the terrible man sitting upon the throne? This is the son of the first created Adam, who is called Abel, whom the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Cain killed, and he sits thus to judge all creation, and examines righteous men and sinners. For God has said, I shall not judge you, but every man born of man shall be judged. Therefore he has given to him judgment, to judge the world until his great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> coming, and then, O righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, is the perfect judgment and recompense, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable, which no one can alter. For every man has come from the first-created, and therefore they are first judged here by his son, and at the second coming they shall be judged by the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, every breath and every creature. But the third time they shall be judged by the Lord God of all, and then, indeed, the end of that judgment is near, and the sentence terrible, and there is none to deliver. And now by three tribunals the judgment of the world and the recompense is made, and for this reason a matter is not finally confirmed by one or two witnesses, but by three witnesses shall everything be established. The two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> on the right hand and on the left, these are they that write down the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the righteousness, the one on the right hand writes down the righteousness, and the one on the left the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> like the sun, holding the balance in his hand, is the archangel, Dokiel the just weigher, and he weighs the righteousnesses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The fiery and pitiless <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, holding the fire in his hand, is the archangel Puruel, who has power over fire, and tries the works of men through fire, and if the fire consume the work of any man, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of judgment immediately seizes him, and carries him away to the place of sinners, a most bitter place of punishment. But if the fire approves the work of anyone, and does not seize upon it, that man is justified, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of righteousness takes him and carries him up to be saved in the lot of the just. And thus, most righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, all things in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are tried by fire and the balance.</q></p>

<p>14. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the chief-captain, My Lord the chief-captain, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> held in his hand, why was it adjudged to be set in the midst? The chief-captain said, Listen, righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Because the judge found its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. and its righteousnesses equal, he neither committed it to judgment nor to be saved, until the judge of all shall come. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the chief-captain, And what yet is wanting for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be saved? The chief-captain said, If it obtains one righteousness above its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it enters into <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the chief-captain, Come hither, chief-captain Michael, let us make <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and see whether God will hear us. The chief-captain said, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, be it so; and they made <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and entreaty for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and God heard them, and when they rose up from their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> they did not see the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> standing there. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, Where is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that you held in the midst? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered, It has been saved by your righteous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light has taken it and carried it up into Paradise. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I glorify the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Most High, and his immeasurable mercy. And Abraham  said to the chief-captain, I beseech you, archangel, hearken to my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and let us yet call upon the Lord, and supplicate his compassion, and entreat his mercy for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the sinners whom I formerly, in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, cursed and destroyed, whom the earth devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces, and the fire consumed through my words. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before the Lord our God. Come then, O Michael, chief-captain of the hosts above, come, let us call upon God with tears that he may forgive me my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and grant them to me. And the chief-captain heard him, and they made entreaty before the Lord, and when they had called upon him for a long space, there came a voice from heaven saying, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, I have hearkened to your voice and your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and those whom you think that I destroyed I have called up and brought them into life by my exceeding kindness, because for a season I have requited them in judgment, and those whom I destroy living upon earth, I will not requite in death.</p>

<p>15. And the voice of the Lord said also to the chief-captain Michael, Michael, my servant, turn back <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to his house, for behold his end has come near, and the measure of his life is fulfilled, that he may set all things in order, and then take him and bring him to me. So the chief-captain, turning the chariot and the cloud, brought <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to his house, and going into his chamber he sat upon his couch. And Sarah his wife came and embraced the feet of the Incorporeal, and spoke humbly, saying, I give you thanks, my Lord, that you have brought my Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, for behold we thought he had been taken up from us. And his son Isaac also came and fell upon his neck, and in the same way all his men-slaves and women-slaves surrounded <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and embraced him, glorifying God. And the Incorporeal one said to them, Hearken, righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Behold your wife Sarah, behold also your beloved son Isaac, behold also all your men-servants and maid-servants round about you. Make disposition of all that you have, for the day has come near in which you shall depart from the body and go to the Lord once for all. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Has the Lord said it, or do you say this of yourself? The chief-captain answered, Hearken, righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. The Lord has commanded, and I tell it you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I will not go with you. The chief-captain, hearing these words, straightway went forth from the presence of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and went up into the heavens, and stood before God the Most High, and said, Lord Almighty, behold I have hearkened to Your friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in all he has said to You, and have fulfilled his requests. I have shown to him Your power, and all the earth and sea that is under heaven. I have shown to him judgment and recompense by means of cloud and chariots, and again he says, I will not go with you. And the Most High said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, Does my friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> say thus again, I will not go with you? The archangel said, Lord Almighty, he says thus, and I refrain from laying hands on him, because from the beginning he is Your friend, and has done all things pleasing in Your sight. There is no man like him on earth, not even Job the wondrous man, and therefore I refrain from laying hands on him. Command, therefore, Immortal King, what shall be done.</p>

<p>16. Then the Most High said, Call me hither Death that is called the shameless countenance and the pitiless look. And Michael the Incorporeal went and said to Death, Come hither; the Lord of creation, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> king, calls you. And Death, hearing this, shivered and trembled, being possessed with great terror, and coming with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it stood before the invisible father, shivering, groaning and trembling, awaiting the command of the Lord. Therefore the invisible God said to Death, Come hither, you bitter and fierce name of the world, hide your fierceness, cover your corruption, and cast away your bitterness from you, and put on your beauty and all your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and go down to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> my friend, and take him and bring him to me. But now also I tell you not to terrify him, but bring him with fair speech, for he is my own friend. Having heard this, Death went out from the presence of the Most High, and put on a robe of great brightness, and made his appearance like the sun, and became fair and beautiful above the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, assuming the form of an archangel, having his cheeks flaming with fire, and he departed to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Now the righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went out of his chamber, and sat under the trees of Mamre, holding his chin in his hand, and awaiting the coming of the archangel Michael. And behold, a smell of sweet odor came to him, and a flashing of light, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> turned and saw Death coming towards him in great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and beauty. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> arose and went to meet him, thinking that it was the chief-captain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Death beholding him saluted him, saying, Rejoice, precious <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and companion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, Hail you of appearance and form like the sun, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> helper, bringer of light, wondrous man, from whence does your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> come to us, and who are you, and whence do you come? Then Death said, Most righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, behold I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I am the bitter lot of death. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him, Nay, but you are the comeliness of the world, you are the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and beauty of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, you are fairer in form than every other, and do you say, I am the bitter lot of death, and not rather, I am fairer than every good thing. Death said, I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. What the Lord has named me, that also I tell you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, For what are you come hither? Death said, For your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> am I come. Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you mean, but I will not go with you; and Death was silent and answered him not a word.</p>

<p>17. Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> arose, and went into his house, and Death also accompanied him there. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went up into his chamber, and Death went up with him. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> lay down upon his couch, and Death came and sat by his feet. Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Depart, depart from me, for I desire to rest upon my couch. Death said, I will not depart until I take your spirit from you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him, By the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God I charge you to tell me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Are you death? Death said to him, I am Death. I am the destroyer of the world. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I beseech you, since you are Death, tell me if you come thus to all in such fairness and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and beauty? Death said, Nay, my Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, for your righteousnesses, and the boundless sea of your hospitality, and the greatness of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God has become a crown upon my head, and in beauty and great peace and gentleness I approach the righteous, but to sinners I come in great corruption and fierceness and the greatest bitterness and with fierce and pitiless look. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I beseech you, hearken to me, and show me your fierceness and all your corruption and bitterness. And Death said, You can not behold my fierceness, most righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Yes, I shall be able to behold all your fierceness by means of the name of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the might of my God that is in heaven is with me. Then Death put off all his comeliness and beauty, and all his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the form like the sun with which he was clothed, and put upon himself a tyrant's robe, and made his appearance gloomy and fiercer than all kind of wild beasts, and more unclean than all uncleanness. And he showed to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seven fiery heads of serpents and fourteen faces, (one) of flaming fire and of great fierceness, and a face of darkness, and a most gloomy face of a viper, and a face of a most terrible precipice, and a face fiercer than an asp, and a face of a terrible lion, and a face of a cerastes and basilisk. He showed him also a face of a fiery scimitar, and a sword-bearing face, and a face of lightning, lightening terribly, and a noise of dreadful thunder. He showed him also another face of a fierce stormy sea, and a fierce rushing river, and a terrible three-headed serpent, and a cup mingled with poisons, and in short he showed to him great fierceness and unendurable bitterness, and every mortal disease as of the odor of Death. And from the great bitterness and fierceness there died servants and maid-servants in number about seven thousand, and the righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> came into indifference of death so that his spirit failed him.</p>

<p>18. And the all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, seeing these things thus, said to Death, I beseech you, all-destroying Death, hide your fierceness, and put on your beauty and the shape which you had before. And straightway Death hid his fierceness, and put on his beauty which he had before. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, Why have you done this, that you have slain all my servants and maidservants? Has God sent you hither for this end this day? Death said, Nay, my Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, it is not as you say, but on your account was I sent hither. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, How then have these died? Has the Lord not spoken it? Death said, Believe, most righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that this also is wonderful, that you also were not taken away with them. Nevertheless I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for if the right hand of God had not been with you at that time, you also would have had to depart from this life. The righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have come into indifference of death, so that my spirit fails, but I beseech you, all-destroying Death, since my servants have died before their time, come let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord our God that he may hear us and raise up those who died by your fierceness before their time. And Death said, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, be it so. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> arose and fell upon the face of the ground in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and Death together with him, and the Lord sent a spirit of life upon those that were dead and they were made alive again. Then the righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>19. And going up into his chamber he lay down, and Death came and stood before him. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him, Depart from me, for I desire to rest, because my spirit is in indifference. Death said, I will not depart from you until I take your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> with an austere countenance and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> look said to Death, Who has ordered you to say this? You say these words of yourself boastfully, and I will not go with you until the chief-captain Michael come to me, and I shall go with him. But this also I tell you, if you desire that I shall accompany you, explain to me all your changes, the seven fiery heads of serpents and what the face of the precipice is, and what the sharp sword, and what the loud-roaring river, and what the tempestuous sea that rages so fiercely. Teach me also the unendurable thunder, and the terrible lightning, and the evil-smelling cup mingled with poisons. Teach me concerning all these. And Death answered, Listen, righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For seven ages I destroy the world and lead all down to Hades, kings and rulers, rich and poor, slaves and free men, I convoy to the bottom of Hades, and for this I showed you the seven heads of serpents. The face of fire I showed you because many die consumed by fire, and behold death through a face of fire. The face of the precipice I showed you, because many men die descending from the tops of trees or terrible precipices and losing their life, and see death in the shape of a terrible precipice. The face of the sword I showed you because many are slain in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> by the sword, and see death as a sword. The face of the great rushing river I showed you because many are drowned and perish snatched away by the crossing of many waters and carried off by great rivers, and see death before their time. The face of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> raging sea I showed you because many in the sea falling into great surges and becoming shipwrecked are swallowed up and behold death as the sea. The unendurable thunder and the terrible lightning I showed you because many men in the moment of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> meet with unendurable thunder and terrible lightning coming to seize upon men, and see death thus. I showed you also the poisonous wild beasts, asps and basilisks, leopards and lions and lions' cubs, bears and vipers, and in short the face of every wild beast I showed you, most righteous one, because many men are destroyed by wild beasts, and others by poisonous snakes, serpents and asps and cerastes and basilisks and vipers, breathe out their life and die. I showed you also the destroying cups mingled with poison, because many men being given poison to drink by other men straightway depart unexpectedly.</p>

<p>20.  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I beseech you, is there also an unexpected death? Tell me. Death said, Verily, verily, I tell you in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God that there are seventy-two deaths. One is the just death, buying its fixed time, and many men in one hour enter into death being given over to the grave. Behold, I have told you all that you have asked, now I tell you, most righteous <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to dismiss all counsel, and cease from asking anything once for all, and come, go with me, as the God and judge of all has commanded me. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, Depart from me yet a little, that I may rest on my couch, for I am very faint at heart, for since I have seen you with my eyes my strength has failed me, all the limbs of my flesh seem to me a weight as of lead, and my spirit is distressed exceedingly. Depart for a little; for I have said I cannot bear to see your shape. Then Isaac his son came and fell upon his breast weeping, and his wife Sarah came and embraced his feet, lamenting bitterly. There came also his men slaves and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> slaves and surrounded his couch, lamenting greatly. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> came into indifference of death, and Death said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Come, take my right hand, and may cheerfulness and life and strength come to you. For Death deceived <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and he took his right hand, and straightway his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> adhered to the hand of Death. And immediately the archangel Michael came with a multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and took up his precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in his hands in a divinely woven linen cloth, and they tended the body of the just <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> with divine ointments and perfumes until the third day after his death, and buried him in the land of promise, the oak of Mamre, but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> received his precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and ascended into heaven, singing the hymn of <q>thrice <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q> to the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, and they set it there to worship the God and Father. And after great praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> had been given to the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> bowed down to worship, there came the undefiled voice of the God and Father saying thus, Take therefore my friend <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> into Paradise, where are the tabernacles of my righteous ones, and the abodes of my <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> Isaac and Jacob in his bosom, where there is no trouble, nor grief, nor sighing, but peace and rejoicing and life unending. (And let us, too, my beloved brethren, imitate the hospitality of the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and attain to his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> way of life, that we may be thought worthy of the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, glorifying the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power forever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.).</p>

<h2>Version 2</h2>

<p>1. It came to pass, when the days of the death of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> drew near, that the Lord said to Michael: Arise and go to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, my servant, and say to him, You shall depart from life, for lo! The days of your temporal life are fulfilled: so that he may set his house in order before he die.</p>

<p>2. And Michael went and came to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and found him sitting before his oxen for ploughing, and he was exceeding old in appearance, and had his son in his arms. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, therefore, seeing the archangel Michael, rose from the ground and saluted him, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> who he was, and said to him: The Lord preserve you. May your journey be prosperous with you. And Michael answered him: You are kind, good father. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered and said to him: Come, draw near to me, brother, and sit down a little while, that I may order a beast to be brought that we may go to my house, and you may rest with me, for it is toward evening, and in the morning arise and go wherever you will, lest some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beast meet you and do you hurt. And Michael enquired of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, saying: Tell me your name, before I enter your house, lest I be burdensome to you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered and said, My <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> called me Abram, and the Lord named me <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, saying: Arise and depart from your house, and from your kindred, and go into the land which I shall show unto you. And when I went away into the land which the Lord showed me, he said to me: Your name shall no more be called Abram, but your name shall be <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Michael answered and said to him: Pardon me, my father, experienced man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for I am a stranger, and I have heard of you that you went forty furlongs and brought a goat and slew it, entertaining <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in your house, that they might rest there. Thus speaking together, they arose and went towards the house. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> called one of his servants, and said to him: Go, bring me a beast that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is wearied with his journey. And Michael said: Trouble not the youth, but let us go lightly until we reach the house, for I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your company.</p>

<p>3. And arising they went on, and as they drew near to the city, about three furlongs from it, they found a great tree having three hundred branches, like to a tamarisk tree. And they heard a voice from its branches singing, <q>Holy are you, because you have kept the purpose for which you were sent.</q> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> heard the voice, and hid the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in his heart, saying within himself, What is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that I have heard? As he came into the house, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to his servants, Arise, go out to the flocks, and bring three sheep, and slay them quickly, and make them ready that we may eat and drink, for this day is a feast for us. And the servants brought the sheep, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> called his son Isaac, and said to him, My son Isaac, arise and put water in the vessel that we may wash the feet of this stranger. And he brought it as he was commanded, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, I perceive, and so it shall be, that in this basin I shall never again wash the feet of any man coming to us as a guest. And Isaac hearing his father say this wept, and said to him, My father what is this that you say? This is my last time to wash the feet of a stranger? And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seeing his son weeping, also wept exceedingly,  and Michael seeing them weeping, wept also, and the tears of Michael fell upon the vessel and became a precious stone.</p>

<p>4. When Sarah, being inside in her house, heard their weeping, she came out and said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Lord, why is it that you thus weep? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered, and said to her, It is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Go into your house, and do your own work, lest we be troublesome to the man. And Sarah went away, being about to prepare the supper. And the sun came near to setting, and Michael went out of the house, and was taken up into the heavens to worship before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for at sunset all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> worship God and Michael himself is the first of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And they all worshipped him, and went each to his own place, but Michael spoke before the Lord and said, Lord, command me to be questioned before your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>! And the Lord said to Michael, Announce whatsoever you will! And the Archangel answered and said, Lord, you sent me to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to say to him, Depart from your body, and leave this world; the Lord calls you; and I dare not, Lord, reveal myself to him, for he is your friend, and a righteous man, and one that receives strangers. But I beseech you, Lord, command the remembrance of the death of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to enter into his own heart, and bid not me tell it him, for it is great abruptness to say, Leave the world, and especially to leave one's own body, for you created him from the beginning to have pity on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Then the Lord said to Michael, Arise and go to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and lodge with him, and whatever you see him eat, eat also, and wherever he shall sleep, sleep there also. For I will cast the thought of the death of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> into the heart of Isaac his son in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>.</p>

<p>5.  Then Michael went into the house of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> on that evening, and found them preparing the supper, and they ate and drank and were merry. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to his son Isaac, Arise, my son, and spread the man's couch that he may sleep, and set the lamp upon the stand. And Isaac did as his father commanded him, and Isaac said to his father, I too am coming to sleep beside you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered him, Nay, my son, lest we be troublesome to this man, but go to your own chamber and sleep. And Isaac not wishing to disobey his father's command, went away and slept in his own chamber.</p>

<p>6. And it happened about the seventh hour of the night Isaac awoke, and came to the door of his father's chamber, crying out and saying, Open, father, that I may touch you before they take you away from me. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his father's neck weeping, and kissed him with lamentations. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> wept together with his son, and Michael saw them weeping and wept likewise. And Sarah hearing them weeping called from her bed-chamber, saying, My Lord <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, why is this weeping? Has the stranger told you of your brother's son <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> that he is dead? Or has anything else befallen us? Michael answered and said to Sarah, Nay, Sarah, I have brought no tidings of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of all your kindness of heart, that therein you excel all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> upon earth, and the Lord has remembered you. Then Sarah said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, How dare you weep when the man of God has come in to you, and why have your eyes  shed tears for today there is great rejoicing? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to her, How do you know that this is a man of God? Sarah answered and said, Because I say and declare that this is one of the three men who were entertained by us at the oak of Mamre, when one of the servants went and brought a kid and you killed it, and said to me, Arise, make ready that we may eat with these men in our house. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered and said, You have perceived well, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for I too, when I washed his feet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in my heart that these were the feet which I had washed at the oak of Mamre, and when I began to enquire concerning his journey, he said to me, I go to preserve <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> your brother from the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and then I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>7. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Michael, Tell me, man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and show to me why you have come hither. And Michael said, Your son Isaac will show you. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to his son, My beloved son, tell me what you have seen in your dream today, and wast frightened. Relate it to me. Isaac answered his father, I saw in my dream the sun and the moon, and there was a crown upon my head, and there came from heaven a man of great size, and shining as the light that is called the father of light. He took the sun from my head, and yet left the rays behind with me. And I wept and said, I beseech you, my Lord, take not away the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of my head, and the light of my house, and all my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And the sun and the moon and the stars lamented, saying, Take not away the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of our power. And that shining man answered and said to me, Weep not that I take the light of your house, for it is taken up from troubles into rest, from a low estate to a high one; they lift him up from a narrow to a wide place; they raise him from darkness to light. And I said to him, I beseech you, Lord, take also the rays with it. He said to me, There are twelve hours of the day, and then I shall take all the rays. As the shining man said this, I saw the sun of my house ascending into heaven, but that crown I saw no more, and that sun was like you my father. And Michael said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Your son Isaac has spoken <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for you shall go, and be taken up into the heavens, but your body shall remain on earth, until seven thousand ages are fulfilled, for then all flesh shall arise. Now therefore, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, set your house in order, and your children, for you have heard fully what is decreed concerning you. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered and said to Michael, I beseech you, Lord, if I shall depart from my body, I have desired to be taken up in my body that I may see the creatures that the Lord my God has created in heaven and on earth. Michael answered and said, This is not for me to do, but I shall go and tell the Lord of this, and if I am commanded I shall show you all these things.</p>

<p>8. And Michael went up into heaven, and spoke before the Lord concerning <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the Lord answered Michael, Go and take up <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the body, and show him all things, and whatsoever he shall say to you do to him as to my friend. So Michael went forth and took up <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the body on a cloud, and brought him to the river of Ocean.</p>

<p>12.  And after <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had seen the place of judgment, the cloud took him down upon the firmament below, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, looking down upon the earth, saw a man committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with a wedded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> turning said to Michael, Do you see this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? But, Lord, send fire from heaven to consume them. And straightway there came down fire and consumed them, for the Lord had said to Michael, do whatever <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> shall ask you to do for him. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> looked again, and saw other men railing at their companions, and said, Let the earth open and swallow them, and as he spoke the earth swallowed them alive. Again the cloud led him to another place, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw some going into a desert place to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and he said to Michael, Do you see this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? But let wild beasts come out of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and tear them in pieces, and that same hour wild beasts came out of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and devoured them. Then the Lord God spoke to Michael saying, Turn away <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to his own house, and let him not go round all the creation that I have made, because he has no compassion on sinners, but I have compassion on sinners that they may turn and live, and repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and be saved.</p>

<p>8. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> looked and saw two gates, the one small and the other large, and between the two gates sat a man upon a throne of great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> round about him, and he was weeping, and again laughing, but his weeping exceeded his laughter seven-fold. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Michael, Who is this that sits between the two gates in great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; sometimes he laughs, and sometimes he weeps, and his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold? And Michael said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> who it is? And he said, No, Lord. And Michael said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Do you see these two gates, the small and the great? These are they which lead to life and to destruction. This man that sits between them is Adam, the first man whom the Lord created, and set him in this place to see every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that departs from the body, seeing that all are from him. When, therefore, you see him weeping, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has seen many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being led to destruction, but when you see him laughing, he has seen many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being led into life. Do you see how his weeping exceeds his laughter? Since he sees the greater part of the world being led away through the broad gate to destruction, therefore his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold.</p>

<p>9. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, And he that cannot enter through the narrow gate, can he not enter into life? Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> wept, saying, Woe is me, what shall I do? For I am a man broad of body, and how shall I be able to enter by the narrow gate, by which a boy of fifteen years cannot enter? Michael answered and said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Fear not, father, nor grieve, for you shall enter by it unhindered, and all those who are like you. And as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> stood and marveled, behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord driving sixty thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of sinners to destruction. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Michael, Do all these go into destruction? And Michael said to him, Yea, but let us go and search among these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, if there is among them even one righteous. And when they went, they found an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> holding in his hand one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from among these sixty thousand, because he had found her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> weighing equally with all her works, and they were neither in motion nor at rest, but in a state between; but the other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> he led away to destruction. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Michael, Lord, is this the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that removes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from the body or not? Michael answered and said, This is death, and he leads them into the place of judgment, that the judge may try them.</p>

<p>10. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, My Lord, I beseech you to lead me to the place of judgment so that I too may see how they are judged. Then Michael took <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> upon a cloud, and led him into Paradise, and when he came to the place where the judge was, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came and gave that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the judge. And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> said, Lord have mercy on me. And the judge said, How shall I have mercy upon you, when you had no mercy upon your daughter which you had, the fruit of your womb? Wherefore did you slay her? It answered, Nay, Lord, slaughter has not been done by me, but my daughter has lied upon me. But the judge commanded him to come that wrote down the records, and behold <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> carrying two books. And there was with them a man of exceeding great stature, having on his head three crowns, and the one crown was higher than the other two. These are called the crowns of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. And the man had in his hand a golden pen, and the judge said to him, Exhibit the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And that man, opening one of the books of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, sought out the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and found it. And the judge said, O wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, why do you say that you have not done <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>? Did you not, after the death of your husband, go and commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with your daughter's husband, and kill her? And he convicted her also of her other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whatsoever she had done from her youth. Hearing these things the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cried out, saying, Woe is me, all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that I did in the world I forgot, but here they were not forgotten. Then they took her away also and gave her over to the tormentors.</p>

<p>11. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Michael, Lord, who is this judge, and who is the other, who convicts the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? And Michael said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Do you see the judge? This is Abel, who first testified, and God brought him hither to judge, and he that bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> here is the teacher of heaven and earth, and the scribe of righteousness, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, for the Lord sent them hither to write down the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and righteousnesses of each one. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, And how can <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> bear the weight of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, not having seen death? Or how can he give sentence to all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? Michael said, If he gives sentence concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, it is not permitted; but <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> himself does not give sentence, but it is the Lord who does so, and he has no more to do than only to write. For <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord saying, I desire not, Lord, to give sentence on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, lest I be grievous to anyone; and the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, I shall command you to write down the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that makes atonement and it shall enter into life, and if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> make not atonement and repent, you shall find its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> written down and it shall be cast into punishment. And about the ninth hour Michael brought <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> back to his house. But Sarah his wife, not seeing what had become of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, was consumed with grief, and gave up the ghost, and after the return of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> he found her dead, and buried her.</p>

<p>13. But when the day of the death of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> drew near, the Lord God said to Michael, Death will not dare to go near to take away the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of my servant, because he is my friend, but go and adorn Death with great beauty, and send him thus to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that he may see him with his eyes. And Michael straightway, as he was commanded, adorned Death with great beauty, and sent him thus to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that he might see him. And he sat down near to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seeing Death sitting near to him was afraid with a great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And Death said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Hail, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! Hail, friend of the Lord God! Hail, consolation and entertainment of travelers! And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said, You are welcome, servant of the Most High. God. I beseech you, tell me who you are; and entering into my house partake of food and drink, and depart from me, for since I have seen you sitting near to me my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been troubled. For I am not at all worthy to come near you, for you are an exalted spirit and I am flesh and blood, and therefore I cannot bear your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for I see that your beauty is not of this world. And Death said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, I tell you, in all the creation that God has made, there has not been found one like you, for even the Lord himself by searching has not found such an one upon the whole earth. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, How dare you lie? For I see that your beauty is not of this world. And Death said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Think not, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that this beauty is mine, or that I come thus to every man. Nay, but if any one is righteous like you, I thus take crowns and come to him, but if it is a sinner I come in great corruption, and out of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> I make a crown for my head, and I shake them with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, so that they are dismayed. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> therefore said to him, And whence comes your beauty? And Death said, There is none other more full of corruption than I am. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him, And are you indeed he that is called Death? He answered him and said, I am the bitter name. I am weeping....</p>

<p>14. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to Death, Show us your corruption. And Death made manifest his corruption; and he had two heads, the one had the face of a serpent and by it some die at once by asps, and the other head was like a sword; by it some die by the sword as by bows. In that day the servants of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> died through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Death, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seeing them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord, and he raised them up. But God returned and removed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and the archangel Michael took it up into the heavens. And Isaac buried his father beside his mother Sarah, glorifying and praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for to him is due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and worship, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now and always and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
