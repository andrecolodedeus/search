<h1>Third Council of Constantinople</h1>

<h2>Session I - Extracts from the Acts</h2>

<p>[<em>After a history of the assembly of the Council, the Acts begin with the Speech of the Papal Legates, as follows</em>:]</p>

<p>Most benign lord, in accordance with the Sacra to our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope  from your God-instructed majesty, we have been sent by him to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> footsteps of your God-confirmed serenity, bearing with us his suggestion (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1FB6;&#x03C2;</span>, <em>suggestione</em>) as well as the other suggestion of his Synod equally addressed to your divinely preserved Piety by the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subject to it, which also we offered to your God-crowned Fortitude. Since, then, during the past forty-six years, more or less, certain novelties in expression, contrary to the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have been introduced by those who were at several times <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this, your royal and God-preserved city, to wit: Sergius, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also by Cyrus, at one time <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the city of Alexandria, as well also as by Theodore, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a city called Pharan, and by certain others their followers, and since these things have in no small degree brought confusion into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the whole world, for they taught dogmatically that there was but one will in the dispensation of the Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, one of the Holy Trinity, and one operation; and since many times your servant, our apostolic see, has fought against this, and then <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> against it, and by no means been able, even up to now, to draw away from such a depraved opinion its advocates, we beseech your God-crowned <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, that such as share these views of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of Constantinople may tell us, what is the source of this new-fangled language.</p>

<p>[<em>Answer of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a> made at the Emperor's bidding</em>:]</p>

<p>We have brought out no new method of speech, but have taught whatever we have received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical Synods, and from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> approved Fathers, as well as from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of this imperial city, to wit: Sergius, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also from Honorius who was Pope of Old Rome, and from Cyrus who was Pope of Alexandria, that is to say with reference to will and operation, and so we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and so we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so we preach; and further we are ready to stand by, and defend this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>The Letter of Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, to the Emperor, and the Letter of Agatho and of 125 Bishops of the Roman Synod, Addressed to the Sixth Council</h2>

<p>(<em>Read at the Fourth Session, November 15, at the request of George, Patriarch of Constantinople and his Suffragans</em>.)</p>

<h3>Introductory Note</h3>

<p>(Bossuet, <em>Defensio Cler. Gal</em>. Lib. VII., cap. xxiv.)</p>

<p>All the fathers spoke one by one, and only after examination were the letters of <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">St. Agatho</a> and the whole Western Council approved. <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, indeed, and the Western Bishops put forth their decrees thus ['We have directed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from our humility to your valour protected of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which shall offer to you the report of us all, that is, of all the Bishops in the Northern or Western Regions, in which too we have summed up the confession of our Apostolic Faith, yet ] not as those who wished to contend about these things as being uncertain, but, being certain and unchangeable to see them forth in a brief definition, [suppliantly beseeching you that, by the favour of your sacred majesty, you would command these same things to be preached to all, and to have force with all.'] Undoubtedly, therefore, so far as in them lay, they defined the matter. The question was, whether the other Churches throughout the world would agree, and a matter so great was only made clear after Episcopal examination. But the high, magnificent, yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> expressions, which <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">St. Agatho</a> had used of his See, namely, that resting on the promise of the Lord it had never turned aside from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that its Pontiffs, the predecessors of <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, who were charged in the person of Peter to strengthen their brethren, had ever discharged that office, this the Fathers of the Council hear and receive. But not the less they examine the matter, they inquire into the decrees of Roman Pontiffs, and, after inquiry held, approve <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho's</a> decrees, condemn those of Honorius: a certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they did not understand <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho's</a> expressions as if it were necessary to receive without discussion every decree of Roman Pontiffs even <em>de fide</em>, inasmuch as they are subjected to the supreme and final examination of a General Council: but as if these expressions taken as a whole, in their total, hold good in the full and complete succession of Peter, as we have often said, and in its proper place shall say at greater length.</p>

<h3>The Letter of Pope Agatho</h3>

<p>(<em>Found in</em> Migne, Pa <em>t. Lat., Tom</em>. LXXXVII., <em>col</em>. 1161; L. and C., <em>Tom. VI., col.</em> 630.)</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and servant of the servants of God to the most devout and serene victors and conquerors, our most beloved sons and lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Emperor <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, and to Heraclius and Tiberius, Augustuses.</p>

<p>While contemplating the various anxieties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and while groaning with vehement weeping before the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that he might impart to my wavering <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the comfort of his divine mercy, and might lift me by his right hand out of the depths of grief and anxiety, I most gratefully recognize, my most illustrious lords and sons, that your purpose [i.e. of holding a Council] afforded me deep and wonderful consolation. For it was most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and emanated from your most meek tranquillity, taught by the divine benignity for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> commonwealth divinely entrusted to your keeping, that your imperial power and clemency might have a care to enquire diligently concerning the things of God (through whom Kings do reign, who is himself King of Kings and Lord of Lords) and might seek after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his spotless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as it has been handed down by the Apostles and by the Apostolic Fathers, and be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> affected to command that in all the churches the pure tradition be held. And that no one may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> intention of yours, or suspect that we have been compelled by force, and have not freely consented to the carrying into effect of the imperial decrees touching the preaching of our evangelical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was addressed to our predecessor Donus, a pontiff of Apostolic memory, they have through our ministry been sent to and entirely approved by all nations and peoples; for these decrees the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> dictated to the tongue of the imperial pen, out of the treasure of a pure heart, as the words of an adviser not of an oppressor, defending himself, not looking with contempt upon others; not afflicting, but exhorting; and inviting to those things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in godly wise, because he, the Maker and Redeemer of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who had he come in the majesty of his Godhead into the world, might have terrified mortals, preferred to descend through his inestimable clemency and humility to the estate of us whom he had created and thus to redeem us, who also expects from us a willing confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>And this it is that the blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles, teaches: <q>Feed the flock of Christ which is among you, not by constraint, but willingly, exhorting it according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Therefore, encouraged by these imperial decrees, O most meek lords of all things, and relieved from the depths of affliction and raised to the hope of consolation, I have begun, refreshed somewhat by a better confidence, to comply with promptness with the things which were sometime ago bidden by the Sacra of your gentlest <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and am endeavouring in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> therewith to find <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, such as our deficient times and the quality of this <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> province permit, and taking advice with my fellow-servant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as well concerning the approaching synod of this <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, as concerning our own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the lovers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Empire, and, afterwards concerning the religious servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I might exhort them to follow in haste the footsteps of your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Tranquillity. And, were it not that the great compass of the provinces, in which our humility's council is situated had caused so great a loss of time, our servitude a while ago could have fulfilled with studious <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> what even now has scarcely been done. For while from the various provinces a council has been gathering about us, and while we have been able to select some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those from this very Roman city immediately subject to your most serene power, or from those near by, others again we have been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wait for from far distant provinces, in which the word of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was preached by those sent by the predecessors of my littleness; and thus quite a space of time has elapsed: and I pass over my bodily pains in consequence of which life to a perpetually suffering person is neither possible nor pleasant. Therefore, most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lords and sons, in accordance with the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> jussio of your God-protected clemency, we have had a care to send, with the devotion of a prayerful heart (from the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> we owe you, not because we relied on the [superabundant] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those whom we send to you), our fellow-servants here present, Abundantius, John, and John, our most reverend brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Theodore and George our most beloved sons and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, with our most beloved son John, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and with Constantine, a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spiritual mother, the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, as well as Theodore, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> legate of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of Ravenna and the religious servants of God the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. For, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> placed amid the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and earning their daily bread by bodily labour with considerable distraction, how could a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in its fullness, be found unless what has been canonically defined by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and apostolic predecessors, and by the venerable five councils, we preserve in simplicity of heart, and without any distorting keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> come to us from the Fathers, always desirous and endeavouring to possess that one and chiefest good, viz.: that nothing be diminished from the things canonically defined, and that nothing be changed nor added thereto, but that those same things, both in words and sense, be guarded untouched? To these same commissioners we also have given the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of some of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, whom this Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> receives, together with their books, so that, having obtained from the power of your most benign <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the privilege of suggesting, they might out of these endeavour to give satisfaction, (when your imperial Meekness shall have so commanded) as to what this Apostolic Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, their spiritual mother and the mother of your God-sprung empire, believes and preaches, not in words of worldly eloquence, which are not at the command of ordinary men, but in the integrity of the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in which having been taught from the cradle, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may serve and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Lord of heaven, the Propagator of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire, even unto the end. Consequently, we have granted them faculty or authority with your most tranquil mightiness, to afford satisfaction with simplicity whenever your clemency shall command, it being enjoined on them as a limitation that they presume not to add to, take away, or to change anything; but that they set forth this tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in all sincerity as it has been taught by the apostolic pontiffs, who were our predecessors. For these delegates we most humbly implore with bent knees of the mind your clemency ever full of condescension, that agreeably to the most benign and most august promise of the imperial Sacra, your Christlike Tranquillity may deem them worthy of acceptance and may deign to give a favourable hearing to their most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> suggestions. Thus may your meekest Piety find the ears of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> open to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and may you order that they return to their own unharmed in their rectitude of our Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as well as in the integrity of their bodies. And thus may the supernal Majesty restore to the benign rule of your government through the most heroic and unconquerable labours of your God-strengthened clemency, the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> commonwealth, and may he subdue hostile nations to your mighty sceptre, that there may be satisfaction from this time forth to every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and to all nations, because what you deigned to promise solemnly by your most august letters about the immunity and safety of those who came to the Council, you have fulfilled in all respects. It is not their wisdom that gave us confidence to make bold to send them to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> presence; but our littleness obediently complied with what your imperial benignity, with a gracious order, exhorted to. And briefly we shall intimate to your divinely instructed Piety, what the strength of our Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> contains, which we have received through Apostolic tradition and through the tradition of the Apostolical pontiffs, and that of the five <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> general synods, through which the foundations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have been strengthened and established; this then is the status [and the regular tradition ] of our Evangelical and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to wit, that as we confess the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and inseparable Trinity, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to be of one deity, of one nature and substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so we will profess also that it has one natural will, power, operation, domination, majesty, potency, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And whatever is said of the same Holy Trinity essentially in singular number we understand to refer to the one nature of the three consubstantial Persons, having been so taught by canonical logic. But when we make a confession concerning one of the same three Persons of that Holy Trinity, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of his adorable dispensation according to the flesh, we assert that all things are double in the one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> according to the Evangelical tradition, that is to say, we confess his two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, to wit the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, of which and in which he, even after the wonderful and inseparable union, subsists. And we confess that each of his natures has its own natural propriety, and that the divine, has all things that are divine, without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And we recognize that each one (of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>) of the one and the same incarnated, that is, humanated (<em>humanati</em>) <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is in him unconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably, intelligence alone discerning a unity, to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of confusion. For we equally detest the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of division and of commixture. For when we confess two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> and two natural wills, and two natural operations in our one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we do not assert that they are contrary or opposed one to the other (as those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and accuse the apostolic tradition of doing. Far be this impiety from the hearts of the faithful!), nor as though separated (<em>per se</em> separated) in two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or subsistences, but we say that as the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> so also he has two natural wills and operations, to wit, the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>: the divine will and operation he has in common with the coessential Father from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>: the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, he has received from us, taken with our nature in time. This is the apostolic and evangelic tradition, which the spiritual mother of your most felicitous empire, the Apostolic Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, holds.</p>

<p>This is the pure expression of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and immaculate profession of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, not invented by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> cunning, but which was taught by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> through the princes of the Apostles. This is the firm and irreprehensible doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, the integrity of the sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of which, so long as it is preached freely, defends the empire of your Tranquillity in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> commonwealth, and exults [will defend it, will render it stable; and exulting], and (as we firmly trust) will demonstrate it full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Believe your most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> [servant], my most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lords and sons, that I am pouring forth these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with my tears, or its stability and exultation [<em>in Greek</em> exaltation]. And these things I (although unworthy and insignificant) dare advise through my sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because your God-granted victory is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of your Tranquillity is our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, the harmlessness of your kindness is the security of our littleness. And therefore I beseech you with a contrite heart and rivers of tears, with prostrated <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, deign to stretch forth your most clement right hand to the Apostolic doctrine which the co-worker of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> labours, the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, has delivered, that it be not hidden under a bushel, but that it be preached in the whole earth more shrilly than a bugle: because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession thereof for which Peter was pronounced blessed by the Lord of all things, was revealed by the Father of heaven, for he received from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer of all</a> himself, by three commendations, the duty of feeding the spiritual sheep of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; under whose protecting shield, this Apostolic Church of his has never turned away from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in any direction of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, whose authority, as that of the Prince of all the Apostles, the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the Ecumenical Synods have faithfully embraced, and followed in all things; and all the venerable Fathers have embraced its Apostolic doctrine, through which they as the most approved luminaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have shone; and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> doctors have venerated and followed it, while the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have pursued it with false criminations and with derogatory <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. This is the living tradition of the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which his Church holds everywhere, which is chiefly to be loved and fostered, and is to be preached with confidence, which conciliates with God through its truthful confession, which also renders one commendable to Christ the Lord, which keeps the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire of your Clemency, which gives far-reaching victories to your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Fortitude from the Lord of heaven, which accompanies you in battle, and defeats your foes; which protects on every side as an impregnable wall your God-sprung empire, which throws terror into opposing nations, and smites them with the divine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, which also in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> celestially gives triumphal palms over the downfall and subjection of the enemy, and ever guards your most faithful sovereignty secure and joyful in peace. For this is the rule of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which this spiritual mother of your most tranquil empire, the Apostolic Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has both in prosperity and in adversity always held and defended with energy; which, it will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has never erred from the path of the apostolic tradition, nor has she been depraved by yielding to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> innovations, but from the beginning she has received the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from her founders, the princes of the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and remains undefiled unto the end, according to the divine promise of the Lord and Saviour himself, which he uttered in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to the prince of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: saying, <q>Peter, Peter, behold, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat; but I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you, that (your) <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not. And when you are converted, strengthen your brethren.</q> Let your tranquil Clemency therefore consider, since it is the Lord and Saviour of all, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is, that promised that Peter's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not fail and exhorted him to strengthen his brethren, how it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all that the Apostolic pontiffs, the predecessors of my littleness, have always confidently done this very thing: of whom also our littleness, since I have received this ministry by divine designation, wishes to be the follower, although unequal to them and the least of all. For woe is me, if I neglect to preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of my Lord, which they have sincerely preached. Woe is me, if I cover over with silence the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which I am bidden to give to the exchangers, i.e., to teach to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people and imbue it therewith. What shall I say in the future examination by Christ himself, if I blush (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid!) to preach here the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his words? What satisfaction shall I be able to give for myself, what for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to me, when he demands a strict account of the office I have received? Who, then, my most clement and most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords and sons, (I speak trembling and prostrate in spirit) would not be stirred by that admirable promise, which is made to the faithful: <q>Whoever shall confess me before men, him also will I confess before my Father, who is in heaven</q>? And which one even of the infidels shall not be terrified by that most severe threat, in which he protests that he will be full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and declares that <q>Whoever shall deny me before men, him also will I deny before my Father, who is in heaven</q>? Whence also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, the apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, gives warning and says: <q>But though we, or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from the heaven should preach to you any other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from what we have evangelized to you, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> Since, therefore, such an extremity of punishment overhangs the corruptors, or suppressors of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by silence, would not any one flee from an attempt at curtailing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Wherefore the predecessors of Apostolic memory of my littleness, learned in the doctrine of the Lord, ever since the prelates of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople have been trying to introduce into the immaculate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> innovation, have never ceased to exhort and warn them with many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that they should, at least by silence, desist from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the depraved dogma, lest from this they make the beginning of a split in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by asserting one will, and one operation of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord: a thing which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and the Apollinarists, the Eutychians, the Timotheans, the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a>, the Theodosians and the Gaianit&aelig; taught, and every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, whether of those who confound, or of those who divide the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Those that confound the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Incarnation, inasmuch as they say that there is one nature of the deity and humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, contend that he has one will, as of one, and (one) personal operation. But they who divide, on the other hand, the inseparable union, unite the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> which they acknowledge that the Saviour possesses, not however in an union which is recognized to be hypostatic; but blasphemously join them by concord, through the affection of the will, like two subsistences, i.e., two somebodies. Moreover, the Apostolic Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the spiritual mother of your God-founded empire, confesses one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord existing of and in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and she maintains that his two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, to wit, the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, exist in him unconfused even after their inseparable union, and she acknowledges that each of these natures of Christ is perfect in the proprieties of its nature, and she confesses that all things belonging to the proprieties of the natures are double, because the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> himself is both perfect God and perfect man, of two and in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: and after his wonderful Incarnation, his deity cannot be thought of without his humanity, nor his humanity without his deity. Consequently, therefore, according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, she also confesses and preaches that there are in him two natural wills and two natural operations. For if anybody should mean a personal will, when in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity there are said to be three Persons, it would be necessary that there should be asserted three personal wills, and three personal operations (which is absurd and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> profane). Since, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> holds, the will is natural, where the one nature of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and inseparable Trinity is spoken of, it must be consistently understood that there is one natural will, and one natural operation. But when in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we confess that in the one person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the mediator between God and men, there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> (that is to say the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>), even after his admirable union, just as we canonically confess the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of one and the same person, so too we confess his two natural wills and two natural operations. But that the understanding of this truthful confession may become clear to your Piety's mind from the God-inspired doctrine of the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, (for your Clemency is incomparably more able to penetrate the meaning of the sacred Scriptures, than our littleness to set it forth in flowing words), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> himself, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect man, in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> shows forth in some instances <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, in others, divine, and still in others both together, making a manifestation concerning himself in order that he might instruct his faithful to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and preach that he is both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man. Thus as man he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to the Father to take away the cup of suffering, because in him our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was complete, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only excepted, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.</q> And in another passage: <q>Not my will, but yours be done.</q> If we wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of which testimony as explained by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved Fathers, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to understand what <q>my will</q> and <q>yours</q> signify, the blessed Ambrose in his second book to the <a href="../cathen/06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian</a>, of blessed memory, teaches us the meaning of this passage in these words, saying: <q>He then, receives my will, he takes my sorrow, I confidently call it sorrow as I am speaking of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, mine is the will, which he calls his, because he bears my sorrow as man, he spoke as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and therefore he says: 'Not as I will but as you will.'</q> Mine is the sadness which he has received according to my affection.  See, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> of princes, how clearly here this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father sets forth that the words our Lord used in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Not my will,</q> pertain to his humanity; through which also he is said, according to the teaching of Blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to have <q>become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the Cross.</q> Wherefore also it is taught us that he was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, which must piously be understood to refer to his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, not according to his divinity (by which he governs all things), but according to his humanity, by which he spontaneously submitted himself to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. St. Luke the Evangelist likewise bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the same thing, telling how the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> according to his humanity to his Father, and said, <q>Father, if it be possible let the cup pass from me; nevertheless not my will but yours be done,</q>&mdash; which passage Athanasius, the Confessor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and Archbishop of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, in his book against <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation, also understanding the wills to be two, thus explains: And when he says, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not my will but yours be done,</q> and again, <q>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;</q> he shows that there are two wills, the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, but the other divine. For his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, out of the weakness of the flesh was fleeing away from the passion, but his divine will was ready for it. What <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> explanation could be found? For how is it possible not to acknowledge in him two wills, to wit, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and a divine, when in him, even after the inseparable union, there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> according to the definitions of the synods? For John also, who leaned upon the Lord's breast, his beloved <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, shows forth the same self-restraint in these words: <q>I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father that sent me.</q> And again: <q>This is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent me, that of all that he gave me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</q> Again he introduces the Lord as disputing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and saying among other things: <q>I seek not my own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent me.</q> On the meaning of which divine words blessed Augustine, a most illustrious doctor, thus writes in his book against Maximinus the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. He says, <q>When the Son says to the Father 'Not what I will, but what you will,' what does it profit you, that you brought your words into subjection and sayest, It shows <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that his will was subject to his Father, as though we would deny that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man should be subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? For that the Lord said this in his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, anyone will quickly see who studies attentively this place of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For therein he says, 'My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.' Can this possibly be said of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the One Word? But, O man, who thinkest to make the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to groan, why do you say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> cannot be sad? But to prevent anyone arguing in this way, he does not say 'I am sad;' (and even if he had so said, it could properly only have been understood of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) but he says 'My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sad,' which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he has as man; however in this also which he said, 'Not what I will' he showed that he willed something different from what the Father did, which he could not have done except in his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since he did not introduce our infirmity into his divine nature, but would transfigure <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affection. For had he not been made man, the Only Word could in no way have said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, 'Not what I will.' For it could never be possible for that immutable nature to will anything different from what the Father willed. If you would but make this distinction, O you <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, you would not be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</q></p>

<p>In this disputation this venerable Father shows that when the Lord says <q>his own</q> he means the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his humanity, and when he says not to do <q>his own will,</q> he teaches us not chiefly to seek our own wills but that through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> we should submit our wills to the Divine Will. From all which it is evident that he had a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will by which he <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that he had in himself this same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will immaculate from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Which thing St. Ambrose also thus treats of in his explanation of St. Luke the Evangelist.</p>

<p>[<em>After this follows a catena of Patristic quotations which I have not thought worth while to produce in full. After St. Ambrose he cites St. Leo, then St. Gregory Nazianzen, then St. Augustine</em>. (L. &amp; C., col. 647.)]</p>

<p>From which testimonies it is clear that each of those natures which the spiritual Doctor has here enumerated has its own natural property, and that to each one a will ought to be assigned. For an angelic nature cannot have a divine or a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, neither can a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have a divine or an angelic will. For no nature can have anything or any motion which pertains to another nature but only that which is naturally given by creation. And as this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter it is most certainly clear that we must needs confess that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> and substances, to wit, the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, united in his one subsistence or person, and that we further confess that there are in him two natural wills, viz.: the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, for his divinity so far as its nature is concerned could not be said to possess a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, nor should his humanity be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have naturally a divine will: And again, neither of these two substances of Christ must be confessed as being without a natural will; but his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will was lifted up by the omnipotency of his divinity, and his divine will was revealed to men through his humanity. Therefore it is necessary to refer to him as God such things as are divine, and as man such things as are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; and each must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> recognized through the hypostatic union of the one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, which the most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> decree of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> sets forth&mdash; [<em>Here follows citation</em>.] This same thing also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod which was gathered together in Constantinople in the time of the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> of august memory, teaches in the seventh chapter of its definitions. [<em>Here follows the citation.</em>] Moreover it is necessary that we should faithfully keep what those Venerable Synods taught, so that we never take away the difference of natures as a result of the union, but confess one Christ, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect God and also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect man, the propriety of each nature being kept intact. Wherefore, if in no respect the difference of the natures of our Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has been taken away, it is necessary that we preserve this same difference in all its proprieties. For whoso teaches that the difference is in no respect to be taken away, declares that it must be preserved in all things. But when the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the followers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say that there is but one will and one operation, how is this difference recognized? Or where is the difference which has been defined by this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod preserved? While if it is asserted that there is but one will in him (which is absurd), those who make this assertion must needs say that that will is either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or divine, or else composite from both, mixed and confused, or (according to the teaching of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>) that Christ has one will and one operation, proceeding from his one composite nature (as they hold). And thus, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the difference of nature is destroyed, which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods declared to be preserved in all respects even after the admirable union. Because, though they taught that Christ was one, his person and substance one, yet on account of the union of the natures which was made hypostatically, they likewise decreed that we should clearly acknowledge and teach the difference of those natures which were united in him, after the admirable union. Therefore if the proprieties of the natures in the same our one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> were preserved on account of the difference [of the natures], it is congruous that we should with full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confess also the difference of his natural wills and operations, in order that we may be shown to have followed in all respects their doctrine, and may admit into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> novelty.</p>

<p>And although there exist numerous works of the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, nevertheless we subjoin to this our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> exposition a few testimonies out of the books which are in Greek, for the sake of fastidiousness. </p>

<p>[<em>Here follows a catena of passages from the Greek fathers, viz</em>.: St. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Theologus</a>, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. John <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, St. Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria. (L. &amp; C., col. 654.)]</p>

<p>From these truthful testimonies it is also demonstrated that these venerable fathers predicated in the one and the same Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> two natural wills, viz.: a divine and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, for when St. Gregory Nazianzen says, <q>The willing of that man who is understood to be the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>,</q> he shows that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will of the Saviour was deified through its union with the Word, and therefore it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So likewise he proves that he had a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, although deified will, and this same he had (as he teaches in what follows) as well as his divine will, which was one and the same with that of the Father. If therefore he had a divine and a deified will, he had also two wills. For what is divine by nature has no need of being deified; and what is deified is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine by nature. And when St. Gregory Nyssen, a great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, says that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is, that there should be understood one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will and another a divine will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what does he bid us understand when he says one and another will, except that there are manifestly two wills?</p>

<p>[<em>He next proceeds to comment upon the passage cited from</em> St. John, <em>then upon that from</em> St. Cyril of Alexandria. <em>After this follow quotations from</em> St. Hilary, St. Athanasius, St. Denys the Areopagite, St. Ambrose, St. Leo, St. Gregory Nyssen, St. Cyril of Alexandria, <em>which are next commented on in their order. He then proceeds</em>: (L. &amp; C., col. 662.)]</p>

<p>There are not lacking most telling passages in other of the venerable fathers, who speak clearly of the two natural operations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not to mention <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, St. John of Constantinople, or those who afterwards conducted the laborious conflicts in defence of the venerable council of Chalcedon and of the Tome of St. Leo against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the assertion of this new dogma has arisen: that is to say, John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Scythopolis, Eulogius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, Euphr&aelig;mius and Anastasius the elder, most worthy rulers of the church of Theopolis, and above all that emulator of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, whose uprightness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> exalted the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State as much as his sincere confession pleased God. And his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory is esteemed worthy of veneration by all nations, whose uprightness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was disseminated with praise throughout the whole world by his most august edicts: one of these, to wit, that addressed to Zoilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a> to satisfy them of the rectitude of the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we offer to your most tranquil <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, sending it together with this paper of our lowliness through the same carriers. But lest this declaration should be thought burdensome on account of its length, we have inserted in this declaration of our humility only a few of the testimonies of the Holy Fathers, especially [when writing to those] on whom the care and arrangement of the whole world as on a firm foundation are recognized to rest; since this is altogether incomparable and great, that the care of the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State being laid aside for a little out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, your august and most religious clemency should desire to understand more clearly the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> preaching. For from the different approved fathers the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has become clear although the treatment is short. For the approved fathers thought it to be superfluous to discourse at length upon what was evident and clear to all; for who, even if he be dull of wit, does not perceive what is evident to all? For it is impossible and contrary to the order of nature that there should be a nature without a natural operation: and even the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> did not dare to say this, although they were, all of them, hunting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> craftiness and cunning questions against the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and arguments agreeable to their depravities.</p>

<p>How then can that now be asserted which never was said by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> fathers, nor even was presumptuously invented by the profane <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, viz.: that of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, the proprieties of each of which are recognized as being preserved in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that anyone in sound mind should declare there was but one operation? Since if there is one, let them say whether it be temporal or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, uncreated or created: the same as that of the Father or different from that of the Father. If therefore it is one, that one and the same must be common to the divinity and to the humanity (which is absurd), therefore while the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wrought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things on earth, likewise also the Father worked with him according to his nature (naturaliter, <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FF6;&#x03C2;</span>); for what things the Father does these the Son also does likewise. But if (as is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> acts which Christ did are to be referred to his person alone as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which is not the same as that of the Father; in one nature Christ worked one set of works, and in the other another, so that according to his divinity the Son does the same things that the Father does; and likewise according to his humanity, what things are proper to the manhood, those same, he as man, did because he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For which reason we rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that same person, since he is one, has two natural operations, to wit, the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, one uncreated, and the other created, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect God and as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect man, the one and the same, the mediator between God and men, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Wherefore from the quality of the operations there is recognized a difference void of offense (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) of the natures which are joined in Christ through the hypostatic union. We now proceed to cite some passages from the execrable writings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  whose words and sayings we equally abominate, for the demonstration of those things which our inventors of new dogma have followed teaching that in Christ there is but one will and one operation.</p>

<p>[<em>Then follow quotations from</em> <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Severus, Theodosius of Alexandria. (L. &amp; C., col. 667.)]</p>

<p>Behold, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords and sons, by the testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, as by spiritual rays, the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church has been illustrated and the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> blindness, which is offering <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to men for imitation, has been revealed. Now it is necessary that the new doctrine should follow somebody, and by whose authority it is supported, we shall note.</p>

<p>[<em>Here follow quotations from</em> Cyrus of Alexandria, Theodore of Pharon, Sergius of Constantinople, Pyrrhus, Paulus <em>his succes</em> <em>sor</em>, Peter <em>his successor</em>. (L. &amp; C., col. 670.)]</p>

<p>Let then your God-founded clemency with the internal eye of discrimination, which for the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people you have been deemed worthy to receive by the Grace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take heed which one of such doctors you think the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people should follow, the doctrine of which one of these they should embrace so as to be saved; for they condemn all, and each one of them the other, according as the various and unstable definitions in their writings assert sometimes that there is one will and one operation, sometimes that there is neither one nor two operations, sometimes one will and operation, and again two wills and two operations, likewise one will and one operation, and again neither one, nor two, and somebody else one and two.</p>

<p>Who does not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, and rage against, and avoid such blind <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, if he have any desire to be saved and seek to offer to the Lord at his coming a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>? Therefore the Holy <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, the mother of your most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> power, should be delivered and liberated with all your might (through the help of God) from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of such teachers, and the evangelical and apostolic uprightness of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which has been established upon the firm rock of this Church of blessed Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, which by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and guardianship remains free from all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, [that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> I say] the whole number of rulers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the people, unanimously should confess and preach with us as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> declaration of the Apostolic tradition, in order to please God and to save their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>And these things we have taken pains to insert in the tractate of our humility, for we have been afflicted and have groaned without ceasing that such grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> should be entertained by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to establish their own peculiar views rather than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and think that our sincere fraternal admonition has its spring in a contempt for them. And indeed the apostolic predecessors of my humility admonished, begged, upbraided, besought, reproved, and exercised every kind of exhortation that the recent wound might receive a remedy, moved thereto not by a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> filled with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> (God is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>) nor through the elation of boasting, nor through the opposition of contention, nor through an inane desire to find some fault with their teachings, nor through anything akin to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of arrogance, but out of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the uprightness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and for the rule of the confession of the pure <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and for the stability of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> state, and for the safety of those who rule the Roman Empire. Nor did they cease from their admonitions after the long duration of this domesticated <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but always exhorted and bore record, and that with fraternal charity, not through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or pertinacious <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> (far be it from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heart to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at another's fall, when the Lord of all teaches, <q>I desire not the death of a sinner, but that he be converted and live;</q> and who rejoices over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> more than over ninety-and-nine just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: who came down from heaven to earth to deliver the lost sheep, inclining the power of his majesty), but desiring them with outstretched spiritual arms, and exhorting to embrace them returning to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and awaiting their conversion to the full rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: that they might not make themselves aliens from our communion, that is from the communion of blessed Peter the Apostle, whose ministry, we (though unworthy) exercise, and preach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he has handed down, but that they should together with us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> Christ the Lord, the spotless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, for the stability of your most strong and serene Empire.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords [singular in the Latin] of all things, that there has been left no possible ambiguity which can prevent the recognizing of those who have followed the inventors of new dogma. For the sweetness of spiritual understanding with which the sayings of the Fathers are full has become evident to the eyes of all; and the stench of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to be avoided by all the faithful, has been made notorious. Nor has it remained unknown that the inventors of new dogma have been shown to be the followers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and not the walkers in the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers: therefore whoever wishes to colour any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his whatever, is condemned by the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> says, <q>For everything that does make manifest is light,</q> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ever remains constant and the same, but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> is ever varying, and in its wanderings adopting things mutually contradictory. On this account the inventors of the new dogma have been shown to have taught things mutually contradictory, because they were not willing to be followers of the Evangelical and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has shone forth by the observations of your God-inspired <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and falsity which has been exposed has attained the contempt which it deserved, it remains that the crowned <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may shine forth victoriously through the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> favours of your God-crowned clemency; and that the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of novelty with its inventors and with those who follow their doctrine, may receive the punishment due their presumption, and be cast forth from the midst of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> prelates for the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity of their innovation, which into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> they have endeavoured to introduce, and to stain with the contagion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity the indivisible and unspotted body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> [of Christ]. For it is not just that the injurious should injure the innocent, nor that the offenses of some should be visited upon the inoffensive, for even if in this world to the condemned mercy is extended, yet they who are thus spared reap for that sparing no benefit in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by those thus sparing them there is incurred no little danger for their unlawful compassion.</p>

<p>But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> has reserved for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> days of your gentleness the amending of these things, that filling on earth the place and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> himself, who has vouchsafed to crown your rule, you may judge just judgment for his Evangelical and Apostolical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for although he be the Redeemer and Saviour of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> yet he suffered injury, and bore it even until now, and inspired the empire of your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, so that you should be worthy to follow the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (as equity demanded, and as the determination of the Holy Fathers and of the Five General Synods decreed), and that you should avenge, through his guardianship, on the spurners of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the injury done your Redeemer and Colleague in reigning, thus fulfilling magnanimously with imperial clemency that prophetic utterance with which David the King and Prophet, spoke to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your house has eaten me up.</q> Wherefore having been extolled for so God-pleasing a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he was deemed fit to hear that blessed word spoken by the Creator of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <q>I have found David, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.</q> And to him also it was promised in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>I have found David, my servant, with my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil have I anointed him: My hand shall aid him and my arm shall comfort him,</q> so that the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> majesty of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> clemency may work to further the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Christ with burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the sake of remuneration, and may he make all the acts of your most powerful empire both <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and prosperous, who has stored up his promise in the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, saying, <q>Seek first the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all these things shall be added unto you.</q> For all, to whom has come the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sacred heads,  have been offering innumerable thanksgivings and unceasing praises to the defender of your most powerful dominion, being filled with admiration for the greatness of your clemency, in that you have so benignly set forth the kind intention of your august magnanimity; for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and most just princes, you have deigned to treat divine things with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having promised every immunity to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sent to you from our littleness.</p>

<p>And we are confident that what your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> clemency has promised, you are powerful to carry out, in order that what has been vowed and promised to God by the religious philanthropy beyond your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> power, may nevertheless be fulfilled by the aid of his omnipotency.</p>

<p>Wherefore let praise by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> memory, and frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be poured forth before the Lord Christ, whose is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for your safety, and your triumphs, and your complete victory, that the nations of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, being impressed by the terror of the supernal majesty, may lay down most humbly their necks beneath the sceptre of your most powerful rule, that the power of your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> kingdom may continue until the ceaseless <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom succeeds to this temporal reign. Nor could anything be found more likely to commend the clemency of your unconquerable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to the divine majesty, than that those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be repelled and the integrity of our Evangelical and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be everywhere set forth and preached.</p>

<p>Moreover, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and God-instructed sons and lords, if the Archbishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople shall choose to hold and to preach with us this most unblameable rule of Apostolic doctrine of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, of the venerable synods, of the spiritual Fathers, according to their evangelical understanding, through which the form of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been set forth by us through the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, there will ensue great peace to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there will remain no scandal of dissension, and that will come to pass which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, when through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the people had come to the acknowledging of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, all of us will be of one heart and of one mind.

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; and in his only-begotten Son, who was begotten of him before all worlds; very God of Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, begotten not made, being of one substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is of the same substance as the Father; by him were all things made which are in heaven and which are in earth; and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together is worshipped and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; the Trinity in unity and Unity in trinity; a unity so far as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is concerned, but a trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or subsistences; and so we confess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; not three gods, but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: not a subsistency of three names, but one substance of three subsistences; and of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> one is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or substance or nature, that is to say one is the godhead, one the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, one the power, one the kingdom, one the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, one the adoration, one the essential will and operation of the same Holy and inseparable Trinity, which has created all things, has made disposition of them, and still contains them.</p>

<p>Moreover we confess that one of the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> consubstantial Trinity, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who was begotten of the Father before the worlds, in the last days of the world for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of our Lady, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, immaculate, ever-virgin and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Mary, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, that is to say according to the flesh which was born of her; and was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> made man, the same being very God and very man. God of God his Father, but man of his Virgin Mother, incarnate of her flesh with a reasonable and intelligent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: of one substance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as touching his godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood, and in all points like us, but without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He was crucified for us under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, he suffered, was buried and rose again; ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>

<p>And this same one Lord of ours, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, we acknowledge to subsist of and in two substances unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably, the difference of the natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the proprieties of each nature being preserved and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not scattered or divided into two Persons, nor confused into one composite nature; but we confess one and the same only-begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, not one in another, nor one added to another, but himself the same in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>&mdash; that is to say in the Godhead and in the manhood  even after the hypostatic union: for neither was the Word changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh, nor was the flesh transformed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word, for each remained what it was by nature. We discern by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> alone the distinction between the natures united in him of which inconfusedly, inseparably and unchangeably he is composed; for one is of both, and through one both, because there are together both the height of the deity and the humility of the flesh, each nature preserving after the union its own proper character without any defect; and each form acting in communion with the other what is proper to itself. The Word working what is proper to the Word, and the flesh what is proper to the flesh; of which the one shines with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the other bows down beneath injuries. Wherefore, as we confess that he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> has two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> or substances, viz.: the Godhead and the manhood, inconfusedly, indivisibly and unchangeably [united], so also the rule of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> instructs us that he has two natural wills and two natural operations, as perfect God and perfect man, one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. And this the apostolic and evangelical tradition and the authority of the Holy Fathers (whom the Holy Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the venerable Synods receive), has plainly taught us.</p>

<p>[<em>The letter goes on to say that this is the traditional <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is that which was set forth in a council over which Pope Martin presided, and that those opposed to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have erred from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, some in one way, and some in another. It next apologizes for the delay in sending the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ordered by the imperial Sacra, and proceeds thus:</em> (Labbe and Cossart, col. 686; Migne, col. 1224).]</p>

<p>In the first place, a great number of us are spread over a vast extent of country even to the sea coast, and the length of their journey necessarily took much time. Moreover we were in hopes of being able to join to our humility our fellow-servant and brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodore, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the island of Great Britain, with others who have been kept there even till today; and to add to these various <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this council who have their sees in different parts, that our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> suggestion [i.e., the doctrinal definition contained in the letters] might proceed from a council of wide-spread influence, lest if only a part were cognizant of what was being done, it might escape the notice of a part; and especially because among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as the Longobards, and the Sclavi, as also the Franks, the French, the Goths, and the Britains, there are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be very many of our fellow-servants who do not cease curiously to enquire on the subject, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is being done in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: who as they can be of advantage so long as they hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with us, and think in unison with us, so are they found troublesome and contrary, if (which may God forbid!) they stumble at any article of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But we, although most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, yet strive with all our might that the commonwealth of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire may be shown to be more sublime than all the nations, for in it has been founded the See of Blessed Peter, the prince of the Apostles, by the authority of which, all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations venerate and worship with us, through the reverence of the blessed Apostle Peter himself. (<em>This is the Latin, which appears to me to be corrupt, the Greek reads as follows</em>: <q>The authority of which for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations together with us worship and revere, according to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the blessed Peter the Apostle himself.</q>)</p>

<p>[<em>The letter ends with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for constancy, and blessings on the State and Emperor, and hopes for the universal diffusion and acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em>.]</p>

<p>I have diligently examined the whole force of the suggestions sent to your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Fortitude, as well by <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope of Old  Rome, as by his synod, and I have scrutinized the works of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved Fathers, which are laid up in my venerable patriarchate, and I have found that all the testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and accepted Fathers, which are contained in those suggestions agree with, and in no particular differ from, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and accepted Fathers.

<h2>Session XIII - The Sentence Against the Monothelites</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council said: After we had reconsidered, according to our promise which we had made to your highness, the doctrinal letters of Sergius, at one time patriarch of this royal god-protected city to Cyrus, who was then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Phasis and to Honorius some time Pope of Old Rome, as well as the letter of the latter to the same Sergius, we find that these documents are quite foreign to the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, to the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Councils, and to all the accepted Fathers, and that they follow the false teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; therefore we entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the names of those men whose doctrines we execrate must also be thrust forth from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, namely, that of Sergius some time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this God-preserved royal city who was the first to write on this impious doctrine; also that of Cyrus of Alexandria, of Pyrrhus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Peter, who died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this God-preserved city, and were like-minded with them; and that of Theodore sometime <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Pharan, all of whom the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and thrice blessed <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, Pope of Old Rome, in his suggestion to our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and God-preserved lord and mighty Emperor, rejected, because they were minded contrary to our <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, all of whom we define are to be subjected to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.

We have also examined the synodal letter of Sophronius of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, some time Patriarch of the Holy City of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Jerusalem, and have found it in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and with the Apostolic teachings, and with those of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> approved Fathers.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, great, and Ecumenical Synod which has been assembled by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the religious decree of the most religious and faithful and mighty Sovereign Constantine, in this God-protected and royal city of Constantinople, New Rome, in the Hall of the imperial Palace, called Trullus, has decreed as follows.</p>

<p>The only-begotten Son, and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who was made man in all things like us without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has declared expressly in the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</q> And again, <q>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</q> Our most gentle Sovereign, the champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and opponent of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine, being reverentially led by this divinely uttered doctrine of peace, and having convened this our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical assembly, has united the judgment of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore this our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod having driven away the impious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which had prevailed for a certain time until now, and following closely the straight path of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved Fathers, has piously given its full assent to the five <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synods (that is to say, to that of the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers who assembled in Nice against the raging <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; and the next in Constantinople of the 150 God-inspired men against Macedonius the adversary of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the impious <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>; and also the first in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> of 200 venerable men convened against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizer</a>; and that in Chalcedon of 630 God-inspired Fathers against Eutyches and Dioscorus <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in addition to these, to the last, that is the Fifth <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod assembled in this place, against <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret against the Twelve Chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the Epistle which was said to be written by Ibas to Maris the Persian), renewing in all things the ancient decrees of religion, and chasing away the impious doctrines of irreligion. And this our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod inspired of God has set its seal to the Creed which was put forth by the 318 Fathers, and again religiously confirmed by the 150, which also the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods cordially received and ratified for the taking away of every soul-destroying <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>The Nicene Creed of the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The Creed of the 150 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers assembled at Constantinople. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod further says, this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Creed of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> would be sufficient for the full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But as the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who, in the beginning, availed himself of the aid of the serpent, and by it brought the poison of death upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, has not desisted, but in like manner now, having found suitable instruments for working out his will (we mean Theodorus, who was Bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter, who were Archbishops of this royal city, and moreover, Honorius who was Pope of the elder Rome, Cyrus Bishop of Alexandria, Macarius who was lately <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Stephen his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>), has actively employed them in raising up for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the stumbling-blocks of one will and one operation in the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one of the Holy Trinity; thus disseminating, in novel terms, among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> people, an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> similar to the mad and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">wicked doctrine</a> of the impious <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Severus, and Themistius, and endeavouring craftily to destroy the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by blasphemously representing his flesh endowed with a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as devoid of will or operation. Christ, therefore, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has raised up our faithful Sovereign, a new David, having found him a man after his own heart, who as it is written, <q>has not suffered his eyes to sleep nor his eyelids to slumber,</q> until he has found a perfect declaration of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by this our God-collected and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod; for, according to the sentence spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</q> the present <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod faithfully receiving and saluting with uplifted hands as well the suggestion which by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, Pope of ancient Rome, was sent to our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and faithful Emperor Constantine, which rejected by name those who taught or preached one will and one operation in the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> who is our very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has likewise adopted that other synodal suggestion which was sent by the Council holden under the same most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope, composed of 125 Bishops, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to his God-instructed tranquillity, as consonant to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> and to the Tome of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Leo, Pope of the same old Rome, which was directed to St. Flavian, which also this Council called the Pillar of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>; and also agrees with the Synodal Epistles which were written by Blessed Cyril against the impious <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and addressed to the Oriental Bishops. Following the five <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical Councils and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved Fathers, with one voice defining that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> must be confessed to be very God and very man, one of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and consubstantial and life-giving Trinity, perfect in Deity and perfect in humanity, very God and very man, of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body subsisting; consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood; in all things like us, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only excepted; begotten of his Father before all ages according to his Godhead, but in these last days for us men and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> made man of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, strictly and properly the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> according to the flesh; one and the same Christ our Lord the only-begotten Son of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> unconfusedly, unchangeably, inseparably indivisibly to be recognized, the peculiarities of neither nature being lost by the union but rather the proprieties of each nature being preserved, concurring in one Person and in one subsistence, not parted or divided into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> but one and the same only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Word, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, according as the Prophets of old have taught us and as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> himself has instructed us, and the Creed of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers has delivered to us; defining all this we likewise declare that in him are two natural wills and two natural operations indivisibly, inconvertibly, inseparably, inconfusedly, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. And these two natural wills are not contrary the one to the other (God forbid!) as the impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> assert, but his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will follows and that not as resisting and reluctant, but rather as subject to his divine and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> will. For it was right that the flesh should be moved but subject to the divine will, according to the most wise Athanasius. For as his flesh is called and is the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, so also the natural will of his flesh is called and is the proper <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Word, as he himself says: <q>I came down from heaven, not that I might do my own will but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father which sent me!</q> where he calls his own will the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his flesh, inasmuch as his flesh was also his own. For as his most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate animated flesh was not destroyed because it was deified but continued in its own state and nature (<span class="greek">&#x1F44;&#x03C1;&#x1FF3; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span>), so also his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, although deified, was not suppressed, but was rather preserved according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Theologus</a>: <q>His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> [i.e., the Saviour's] is not contrary to God but altogether deified.</q></p>

<p>We glorify two natural operations indivisibly, immutably, inconfusedly, inseparably in the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say a divine operation and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operation, according to the divine preacher Leo, who most distinctly asserts as follows: <q>For each form (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03C6;&#x1F74;</span>) does in communion with the other what pertains properly to it, the Word, namely, doing that which pertains to the Word, and the flesh that which pertains to the flesh.</q></p>

<p>For we will not admit one natural operation in God and in the creature, as we will not exalt into the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> what is created, nor will we bring down the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the divine nature to the place suited to the creature.</p>

<p>We recognize the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the sufferings as of one and the same [Person], but of one or of the other nature of which he is and in which he exists, as Cyril admirably says. Preserving therefore the inconfusedness  and indivisibility, we make briefly this whole confession, believing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to be one of the Trinity and after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we say that his two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> shone forth in his one subsistence in which he both performed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and endured the sufferings through the whole of his economic conversation (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F30; &#x1F45;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03BA;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2;</span>), and that not in appearance only but in very deed, and this by reason of the difference of nature which must be recognized in the same Person, for although joined together yet each nature wills and does the things proper to it and that indivisibly and inconfusedly. Wherefore we confess two wills and two operations, concurring most fitly in him for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<p>These things, therefore, with all diligence and care having been formulated by us, we define that it be permitted to no one to bring forward, or to write, or to compose, or to think, or to teach a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whosoever shall presume to compose a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or to propose, or teach, or hand to those wishing to be converted to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, any different Creed; or to introduce a new voice or invention of speech to subvert these things which now have been determined by us, all these, if they be Bishops or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> let them be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, the Bishops from the Episcopate, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; but if they be <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>: let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.</p>

<h2>The Prosphoneticus to the Emperor</h2>

<p>[<em>This address begins with many compliments to the Emperor, especially for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>.]</p>

<p>But because the adversary <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> allows no rest, he has raised up the very ministers of Christ against him, as if armed and carrying weapons, etc.</p>

<p>[<em>The various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are then named and how they were condemned by the preceding five councils is set forth</em>.]</p>

<p>Things being so, it was necessary that your beloved of Christ majesty should gather together this all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and numerous assembly.</p>

<p>Thereafter being inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and all agreeing and consenting together, and giving our approval to the doctrinal letter of our most blessed and exalted pope, <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, which he sent to your mightiness, as also agreeing to the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of one hundred and twenty-five fathers held under him, we teach that one of the Holy Trinity, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, was incarnate, and must be celebrated in two perfect natures without division and without confusion. For as the Word, he is consubstantial and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with God his father; but as taking flesh of the immaculate Virgin Mary, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, he is perfect man, consubstantial with us and made in time. We declare therefore that he is perfect in Godhead and that the same is perfect likewise in manhood, according to the pristine tradition of the fathers and the divine definition of Chalcedon.</p>

<p>And as we recognize two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so also we recognize two natural wills and two natural operations. For we dare not say that either of the natures which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> is without a will and operation: lest in taking away the proprieties of those natures, we likewise take away the natures of which they are the proprieties. For we neither deny the natural will of his humanity, or its natural operation: lest we also deny what is the chief thing of the dispensation for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and lest we attribute <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to the Godhead. For this they were attempting who have recently introduced the detestable novelty that in him there is but one will and one operation, renewing the malignancy of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Eutyches and Severus. For should we say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our Lord is without will and operation, how could we affirm in safety the perfect humanity? For nothing else constitutes the integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> except the essential will, through which the strength of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is marked in us; and this is also the case with the substantial operation. For how shall we call him perfect in humanity if he in no wise suffered and acted as a man? For like as the union of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> preserves for us one subsistence without confusion and without division; so this one subsistence, showing itself in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, demonstrates as its own what things belong to each.</p>

<p>Therefore we declare that in him there are two natural wills and two natural operations, proceeding commonly and without division: but we cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and rightly subject to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> all superfluous novelties as well as their inventors: to wit, Theodore of Pharan, Sergius and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Pyrrhus, and Peter (who were <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Constantinople), moreover Cyrus, who bore the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Alexandria, and with them Honorius, who was the ruler (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03B5;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of Rome, as he followed them in these things. Besides these, with the best of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> and depose Macarius, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Stephen (or rather we should say master), who tried to defend the impiety of their predecessors, and in short stirred up the whole world, and by their pestilential letters and by their fraudulent institutions devastated multitudes in every direction. Likewise also that old man Polychronius, with an infantile intelligence, who promised he would raise the dead and who when they did not rise, was laughed at; and all who have taught, or do teach, or shall presume to teach one will and one operation in the incarnate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>....But the highest prince of the Apostles fought with us: for we had on our side his imitator and the successor in his see, who also had set forth in his letter the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the divine word (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>). For the ancient city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> handed you a confession of divine character, and a chart from the sunsetting raised up the day of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, and made the darkness manifest, and Peter spoke through <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, and you, O autocratic King, according to the divine decree, with the Omnipotent Sharer of your throne, judged.</p>

<p>But, O benign and justice-loving Lord, do this favour in return to him who has bestowed your power upon you; and give, as a seal to what has been defined by us, your imperial ratification in writing, and so confirm them with the customary <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> edicts and constitutions, that no one may contradict the things which have been done, nor raise any fresh question. For rest assured, O serene majesty, that we have not falsified anything defined by the Ecumenical Councils and by the approved fathers, but we have confirmed them. And now we all cry out with one mind and one voice, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save the King! etc., etc.</q></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical council which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sanction of the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and faithful Constantine, the great Emperor, has been gathered together in this God-preserved and royal city, Constantinople, the new Rome, in the <em>Secretum</em> of the imperial (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span>, sacri) palace called Trullus, to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most blessed pope of Old Rome, <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>, health in the Lord.</p>

<p>Serious illnesses call for greater helps, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, most blessed [father]; and therefore Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the creator and governing power of all things, gave a wise physician, namely your God-honoured <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, to drive away by force the contagion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pestilence by the remedies of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and to give the strength of health to the members of the church. Therefore to you, as to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the first see of the Universal Church, we leave what must be done, since you willingly take for your standing ground the firm rock of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from having read your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession in the letter sent by your fatherly beatitude to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor: and we acknowledge that this letter was divinely written (<em>perscriptas</em>) as by the Chief of the Apostles, and through it we have cast out the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which had recently sprung up, having been urged to making a decree by Constantine who divinely reigns, and wields a most clement sceptre. And by his help we have overthrown the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of impiety, having as it were laid siege to the nefarious doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And then tearing to pieces the foundations of their execrable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and attacking them with spiritual and paternal arms, and confounding their tongues that they might not speak consistently with each other, we overturned the tower built up by these followers of this most impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and we slew them with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, as lapsed concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and as sinners, in the morning outside the camp of the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may express ourselves after the manner of David,  in accordance with the sentence already given concerning them in your letter, and their names are these: Theodore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Pharan, Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Pyrrhus and Peter. Moreover, in addition to these, we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> subjected to the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> those also who live in their impiety which they have received, or, to speak more accurately, in the impiety of these God-<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Severus and Themestius, to wit, Macarius, who was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the great city of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (and him we also stripped deservedly of his pastor's robes on account of his impenitence concerning the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and his obstinate stubbornness), and Stephen, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> in craziness and his teacher in impiety, also Polychronius, who was inveterate in his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines, thus answering to his name; and finally all those who impenitently have taught or do teach, or now hold or have held similar doctrines.</p>

<p>Up to now grief, sorrow, and many tears have been our portion. For we cannot laugh at the fall of our neighbours, nor exult with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at their unbridled <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, nor have we been elated that we might fall all the more grievously because of this thing; not thus, O venerable and sacred head, have we been taught, we who hold Christ, the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, to be both benign and man-loving in the highest degree; for he exhorts us to be imitators of him in his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> so far as is possible, as becomes the good, and to obtain the pattern of his pastoral and conciliatory government. But also to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance the most Serene Emperor and ourselves have exhorted them in various ways, and we have conducted the whole matter with great religiousness and care. Nor have we been moved to do so for the sake of gain, nor by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, as you can easily see from what things have been done in each session, and related in the minutes, which are herewith sent to your blessedness: and you will understand from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> vicars, Theodore and George, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from John, the most religious <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and from Constantine, the most venerable <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, all of them your spiritual children and our well-loved brethren. So too you will hear the same things from those sent by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who rightly and uprightly, in accordance with your discipline, decreed with us in the first chapter of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, illuminated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and instructed by your doctrine, we have cast forth the vile doctrines of impiety, making smooth the right path of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, being in every way encouraged and helped in so doing by the wisdom and power of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and serene Emperor Constantine. And then one of our number, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pr&aelig;sul of this reigning Constantinople, in the first place assenting to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> compositions sent by you to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor as in all respects agreeable to the teaching of the approved Fathers and of the God-instructed Fathers, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> five universal councils, we all, by the help of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, easily accomplished what we were striving after. For as God was the mover, so God also he crowned our council.</p>

<p>Thereupon, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shone upon us, displaying his power, through your assiduous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, for the uprooting of all weeds and every tree which brought not forth good fruit, and giving command that they should be consumed by fire. And we all agree both in heart and tongue, and hand, and have put forth, by the assistance of the life-giving Spirit, a definition, clean from all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, certain, and infallible; not 'removing the ancient landmarks,' as it is written (God forbid!), but remaining steadfast in the testimonies and authority of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and approved fathers, and defining that, as of two and in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> (to wit, the divinity and the humanity) of which he is composed and in which he exists, Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is preached by us, and is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> inseparably, unchangeably, unconfusedly, and undividedly; just so also we predicate of him two natural operations, undividedly, incontrovertibly, unconfusedly, inseparably, as has been declared in our synodal definition. These decrees the majesty of our God-copying Emperor assented to, and subscribed them with his own hand. And, as has been said, we rejected and condemned that most impious and unsubstantial <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which affirmed but one will and one operation in the incarnate Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by so doing we have pressed sore upon the crowd who confound and who divide, and have extinguished the inflamed storm of other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, but we have set forth clearly with you the shining light of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your paternal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> to confirm our decree by your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> rescript; through which we confide in good hope in Christ that his merciful kindness will grant freely to the Roman State, committed to the care of our most clement Emperor, stability; and will adorn with daily yokes and victories his most serene clemency; and that in addition to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he has here bestowed upon us, he will set your God-honoured <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> before his tremendous tribunal as one who has sincerely confessed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, preserving it unsullied and keeping good ward over the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> flocks committed to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>We and all who are with us salute all the brethren in Christ who are with your blessedness.</p>

<h2>The Imperial Edict Posted in the Third Atrium of the Great Church Near What is Called Dicymbala</h2>

<p>In the name of our Lord and Master <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our God and Saviour, the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, the peaceful and Christ-loving Constantine, an Emperor faithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to all our Christ-loving people living in this God-preserved and royal city.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>[<em>The document is very long, <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> gives the following epitome, which is all sufficient for the ordinary reader, who will remember that it is an Edict of the Emperor and not anything proceeding from the council</em>.]</p>

<p> <em><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele's</a> Epitome</em> (<em>Hist. of the Councils</em>, Vol. v., p. 178).</p>

<p><q>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, etc., has been renewed by Theodore of Pharan and confirmed by Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, who also contradicted himself. Also Cyrus, Pyrrhus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Peter; more recently. Macarius, Stephen, and Polychronius had diffused <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. He, the Emperor, had therefore convoked this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod, and published the present edict with the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order to confirm and establish its decrees. (There follows here an extended confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the doctrine of two wills and operations.) As he recognized the five earlier Ecumenical Synods, so he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, but especially the originator and patrons of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, Theodore and Sergius; also Pope Honorius, who was their adherent and patron in everything, and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F31;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>, further, Cyrus, etc., and ordained that no one henceforth should hold a different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or venture to teach one will and one energy. In no other than the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could men be saved. Whoever did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the imperial edict should, if he were a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if an official, punished with confiscation of property and loss of the girdle (<span class="greek">&#x03B6;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span>); if a private person, banished from the residence and all other cities.</q></p>
