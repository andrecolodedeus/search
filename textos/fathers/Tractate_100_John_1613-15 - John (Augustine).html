<h1>Tractate 100 (John 16:13-15)</h1>

<p>1. When our Lord gave the promise of the coming of His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He said, <q>He shall teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> or, as we read in some copies, <q>He shall guide you into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.</q> On these <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> words we have already discoursed as the Lord enabled us; and now give your attention to those that follow. <q>And He will show you,</q> He said, <q>things to come.</q> Over this, which is perfectly plain, there is no need to linger; for it contains no question that demands from us any regular exposition. But the words that He proceeds to add, <q>He shall make me clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>;  for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you,</q> are not to be carelessly passed over. For by the words, <q>He shall make me clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> we may understand, that by shedding abroad [God's] <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and making them spiritual, He showed them how it was that the Son was equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whom previously they had only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according to the flesh, and as men themselves had thought of Him only as man. Or at least that, filled themselves through that very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with boldness, and divested of all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they might proclaim Christ unto men; and so His fame be spread abroad through the whole world. So that He said, <q>He shall make me clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> as if meaning, He shall free you from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and endow you with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that will so inflame your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in preaching me, that you will send forth the odor, and commend the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of, my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> throughout the world. For what they were to do in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He said that the Spirit Himself would also do, as is implied in the words, <q>For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171652"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span> The Greek word, indeed, which is <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BE;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>, has been rendered by the Latin interpreters in their respective translations, <em>clarificabit</em> (<q>shall make clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></q>) by one, and <em>glorificabit</em> (<q>shall glorify</q>) by another: for the idea expressed in Greek by the one term <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;</span>, from which is derived the verb <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BE;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>, may be interpreted both by <em>claritas</em> (brightness) and <em>gloria</em> (<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>). For by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> every one becomes bright, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by brightness; and hence what is signified by both words, is one and the same thing. And, as the most famous writers of the Latin tongue in olden time have defined it, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the generally diffused and accepted fame of any one accompanied with praise. But when this happened in the world in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are not to suppose that it was the bestowing of any great thing on Christ, but on the world. For to praise what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not of benefit to that which receives, but to those who give the commendation.</p>

<p>2. But there is also a false <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when the praise given is the result of a mistake, whether in regard to things or to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or to both. For men are mistaken in regard to things, when they think that to be good which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and in regard to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, when they think one to be good who is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and in regard to both, when what is actually a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is esteemed a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and when he who is praised for something is destitute of what he is supposed to have, whether he be good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. To credit vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>  with the things they profess, is surely a huge <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and yet you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how common is the laudatory fame of such; for, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>The sinner is praised in the desires of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and he who practises iniquity is blessed.</q>  Here those who praise are not mistaken in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but in the things; for that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be good. But those who are morally corrupted with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of prodigality are undoubtedly such as those who praise them do not simply suspect, but perceive them to be. But further, if one feign himself a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and be not so, but, as regards all that he seems to do in a praiseworthy way in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, does it not for God's sake, that is, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness, but makes <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men the only <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he seeks and hankers after; while those with whom his extolled fame is generally accepted think of him only as living in a praiseworthy way for God's sake&mdash;they are not mistaken in the thing, but are deceived in the person. For that which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be good, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but the person whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be good, is the reverse. But if, for example, skill in magical arts be esteemed good, and any one, so long as he is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have delivered his country by those same arts whereof all the while he is utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, attain among the irreligious to that generally accepted renown which is defined as <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, those who so praise <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in both respects; to wit, both in the thing, for they esteem that good which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and in the person, for he is not at all what they suppose him. But when, in regard to any one who is righteous by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and for God's sake, in other words, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> righteous, there is on account of that very righteousness a generally accepted fame of a laudatory kind, then the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is indeed a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one; and yet we are not to suppose that thereby the righteous man is made blessed, but rather those who praise him are to be congratulated, because they judge rightly, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the righteous. And how much more, then, did Christ the Lord, by His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, benefit, not Himself, but those whom He also benefited by His death?</p>

<p>3. But that is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He has among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, with whom, nevertheless, He appears to have a generally accepted fame accompanied with praise. Such is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, because in both respects they are mistaken, for they both think that to be good which is not good, and they suppose Christ to be what Christ is not. For to say that the only-begotten Son is not equal to Him that begot, is not good: to say that the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is man only, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not good: to say that the flesh of the Truth is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh, is not good. Of the three doctrines which I have stated, the first is held by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the second by the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>, and the third by the Manicheans. But inasmuch as there is nothing in any of them that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and Christ has nothing to do with them, in both respects they are in the wrong; and they attach no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although there may appear to be among them a generally accepted fame regarding Christ of a laudatory character. And accordingly all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> together, whom it would be too tedious to enumerate, who have not right views regarding Christ, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> on this account, that their views are untrue regarding both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, also, of whom great numbers are lauders of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are themselves also mistaken in both respects, saying, as they do, not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather with their own conjectures, that He was a magician. For they reproach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as being destitute of skill; but Christ they laud as a magician, and so betray what it is that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: Christ indeed they do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, since what they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is that which Christ never was. And thus, then, in both respects they are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to be a magician; and as Christ was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, He was not a magician. Wherefore, as we have nothing to say in this place of those who malign and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Christ,&mdash; for it is of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> we speak, wherewith He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the world&mdash;it was only in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him with His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For elsewhere, that is, either among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or certain <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He has in the world cannot be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, even where there is a generally accepted fame of Him accompanied with praise. His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is celebrated in these words by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Be thou exalted, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above the heavens; and Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> above all the earth.</q>  Accordingly, that after His exaltation the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was to come, and to glorify Him, the sacred psalm, and the Only-begotten Himself, promised as an event of the future, which we see accomplished.</p>

<p>4. But when He says, <q>He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you,</q> listen thereto with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ears, and receive it with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minds. For not surely on that account, as certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have imagined, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> inferior to the Son; as if the Son received from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in reference to certain gradations of natures. Far be it from us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, or to say it, and from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hearts to think it. In fine, He Himself straightway solved the question, and explained why He said so. <q>All things that the Father has are mine: therefore, said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you.</q> What would you more? The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> thus receives of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom the Son receives; for in this Trinity the Son is born of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and from the Father the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceeds. He, however, who is born of none, and proceeds from none, is the Father alone. But in what sense it is that the only-begotten Son said, <q>All things that the Father has are mine</q> (for it certainly was not in the same sense as when it was said to that son, who was not only begotten, but the elder of two, <q>You are ever with me; and all that I have is yours),</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171656"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;15:31</a></span> will have our careful consideration, if the Lord so will, in connection with the passage where the Only-begotten says to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>And all mine are Yours, and Yours are mine;</q>  so that our present discourse may be here brought to a close, as the words that follow require a different opening for their discussion.</p>
