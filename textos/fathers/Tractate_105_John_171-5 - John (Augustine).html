<h1>Tractate 105 (John 17:1-5)</h1>

<p>1. That the Son was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Father in His form of a servant, which the Father raised from the dead and set at His own right hand, is indicated by the event itself, and is nowhere <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But as He not only said, <q>Father, glorify Your Son,</q> but likewise added, <q>that Your Son may glorify You,</q> it is worthy of inquiry how it was that the Son <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father neither suffered diminution in any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, nor could be increased in respect of its own divine perfection. In itself, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father could neither be diminished nor enlarged; but without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was less among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> when God was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>:  and as yet children  praised not the name of the Lord from the rising of the sun to its going down.  But inasmuch as this was effected by the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to wit, that the Father became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the Son to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, assuredly the Son also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Father. Had the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, however, only died, and not risen again, He would without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have neither been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Father; but now having been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He glorifies the Father by the preaching of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For this is disclosed by the very order of the words: <q>Glorify,</q> He says, <q>Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You;</q> saying, as it were, Raise me up again, that by me You may become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the world.</p>

<p>2. And then expanding still further how it was that the Father should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He says: <q>As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to all that You have given Him.</q> By all flesh, He meant every man, signifying the whole by a part; as, on the other hand, the whole man is signified by the superior part, when the apostle says, <q>Let every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be subject to the higher powers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171700"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1</a></span> For what else did He mean by <q>every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> save every man? And this, therefore, that power over all flesh was given to Christ by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is to be understood in respect of His humanity; for in respect of His Godhead all things were made by Himself, and in Him were created all things in heaven and in earth, visible and invisible. <span class="stiki" id="note171701"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16</a></span> <q>As,</q> then, He says, <q>You have given Him power over all flesh,</q> so may Your Son glorify You, in other words, make You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all flesh whom You have given Him. For You have so given, <q>that He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to all that You have given Him.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>And this,</q> He adds, <q>is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent.</q> The proper order of the words is, <q>That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent, as the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q> Consequently, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is also understood, because He is the Spirit of the Father and Son, as the substantial and consubstantial <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of both. For the Father and Son are not two Gods, nor are the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> three Gods; but the Trinity itself is the one only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And yet the Father is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor the Son the same as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the same as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; for the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are three [<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>], yet the Trinity itself is one God. If, then, the Son glorifies You in the same manner <q>as You have given Him power over all flesh,</q> and hast so given, <q>that He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to all that You have given Him,</q> and <q>this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You;</q> in this way, therefore, the Son glorifies You, that He makes You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all whom You have given Him. Accordingly, if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, we are making the greater advances to life, in proportion as we are enlarging our growth in such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And we shall not die in the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; for then, when there shall be no death, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God shall be perfected. Then will be effected the full effulgence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because then the completed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as expressed in Greek by <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;</span> . For from it we have the word <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, that is used here, and which some Latins have interpreted by <q> <em>clarifica</em></q> (make effulgent), and some by <q> <em>glorifica</em></q> (glorify). But by the ancients, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, from which men are styled <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, is thus defined: Glory is the widely-spread fame of any one accompanied with praise. But if a man is praised when the fame regarding him is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, how will God be praised when He Himself shall be seen? Hence it is said in Scripture, <q>Blessed are they that dwell in Your house; they will be praising You for ever and ever.</q>  There will God's praise continue without end, where there shall be the full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and because the full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, therefore also the complete effulgence or glorification.</p>

<p>4. But God is first of all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> here, while He is being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to men by word of mouth, and preached through the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. Wherefore, He says, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth: I have finished the work which You gave me to do.</q> He does not say, You ordered; but, <q>You gave:</q> where the evident <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of it is commended to notice. For what has the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> even in the Only-begotten, that it has not received? Did it not receive this, that it should do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, when it was assumed into the unity of His person by the Word, by whom all things were made? But how has He finished the work which was committed unto Him to do, when there still remains the trial of the passion wherein He especially furnished His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with the example they were to follow, whereof, says the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171703"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> but just that He says He has finished, what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> with perfect certainty that He would finish? Just as long before, in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, He used words in the past tense, when what He said was to take place very many years afterwards: <q>They pierced,</q> He says, <q>my hands and my feet, they counted  all my bones;</q>  He says not, They will pierce, and, They will count. And in this very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> He says, <q>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you;</q>  to whom He afterward declares, <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</q>  For He, who has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> all that is to be by sure and unchangeable causes, has done whatever He is to do: as it was also declared of Him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Who has made the things that are to be.</q> </p>

<p>5. In a way similar, also, to this, He proceeds to say: <q>And now, O Father, glorify me with Your own self with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was.</q> For He had said above, <q>Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You:</q> in which arrangement of the words He had shown that the Father was first to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in order that the Son might glorify the Father. But now He said, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth: I have finished the work which You gave me to do; and now glorify Thou me;</q> as if He Himself had been the first to glorify the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom He then demands to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. We are therefore to understand that He used both words above in accordance with that which was future, and in the order in which they were future, <q>Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You:</q> but that He now used the word in the past tense of that which was still future, when He said, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth: I have finished the work which You gave me to do.</q> And then, when He said, <q>And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Your own self,</q> as if He were afterwards to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whom He Himself had first <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; what did He intimate but that, when He said above, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth,</q> He had so spoken as if He had done what He was still to do; but that here He demanded of the Father to do that whereby the Son should yet do so; in other words, that the Father should glorify the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by means of which glorification of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son also was yet to glorify the Father? In fine, if, in connection with that which was still future, we put the verb also in the future tense, where He has used the past in place of the future tense, there will remain no obscurity in the sentence: as if He had said, <q>I will glorify You on the earth: I will finish the work which You have given me to do; and now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Your own self.</q> In this way it is as plain as when He says, <q>Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You:</q> and this is indeed the whole sentence, save that here we are told also the manner of that same glorification, which there was left unnoticed; as if the former were explained by the latter to those whose hearts it was able to stir, how it was that the Father should glorify the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and most of all how the Son also should glorify the Father. For in saying that the Father was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Himself on the earth, but He Himself by the Father with the Father's very self, He showed them assuredly the manner of both glorifications. For He Himself <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Father on earth by preaching Him to the nations; but the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him with His own self in setting Him at His own right hand. But on that very account, when He says afterward in reference to the glorifying of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You,</q> He preferred putting the verb in the past tense, in order to show that it was already done in the act of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and what was with perfect certainty yet to take place was to be accounted as already done; namely, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Father with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, would also glorify the Father on the earth.</p>

<p>6. But this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> He still more clearly disclosed in respect of His own glorification, wherewith He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He added, <q>With the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had, before the world was, with You.</q> The proper order of the words is, <q>which I had with You before the world was.</q> To this apply His words, <q>And now glorify Thou me;</q> that is to say, as then, so also now: as then, by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; so also now, by consummation: do Thou in the world what had already been done with You before the world: do in its own time what You have determined before all times. This, some have imagined, should be so understood as if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which was assumed by the Word, were converted into the Word, and the man were changed into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yea, were we reflecting with some care on the opinions they have advanced, as if the humanity were lost in the Godhead. For no one would go the length of saying that out of such a transmutation of the humanity the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is either doubled or increased, so that either what was one should now be two, or what was less should now be greater. Accordingly, if with His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> changed and converted into the Word, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> will still be as great as He was, and what He was, where is the humanity, if it is not lost?</p>

<p>7. But to this opinion, which I certainly do not see to be conformable to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is nothing to urge us, if, when the Son says, <q>And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Your own self, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was,</q> we understand the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as thereafter, from being mortal, to become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> with the Father: and that this had already been done by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> before the world was, as also in its own time it was done in the world. For if the apostle has said of us, <q>According as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171709"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> why should it be thought incongruous with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> our Head at the same time as He chose us in Him to be His members? For we were chosen in the same way as He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; inasmuch as before the world was, neither we nor the Mediator between God and men, the <em>man</em> Christ Jesus, <span class="stiki" id="note171710"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> were yet in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But He who, in as far as He is His Word, of His own self <q>made even those things which are yet to come,</q> and <q>calls those things which are not as though they were,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171711"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;4:17</a></span> certainly, in respect of His manhood as Mediator between God and men, was Himself <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> on our behalf by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father before the foundation of the world, if it be so that we also were then chosen in Him. For what says the apostle? <q>And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to them who are the called according to His purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He also did <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren: and whom He did <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a>, them He also called.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171712"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28-30</a></span> </p>

<p>8. But perhaps we shall have some <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in saying that He was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, because the apostle seems to have said so only in reference to our being made conformable to His image. As if, indeed, any one, faithfully considering the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were to deny that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, who yet cannot deny that He was man. For it is rightly said that He was not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> in respect of His being the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For how could He be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, seeing He already was what He was, without beginning and without ending, everlasting? But that, which as yet was not, had to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, in order that it might come to pass in its time, even as it was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> so to come before all times. Accordingly, whoever denies <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, denies that He was also Himself the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. But, on account of those who are disputatious, let us also on this subject listen to the apostle in the exordium of his epistles. For both in the first of his epistles, which is that to the Romans, and in the beginning of the epistle itself, we read: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, called [to be] an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, separated unto the gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He had promised afore by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, concerning His Son, who was made for Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>  the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power, according to the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the resurrection from the dead.</q>  In respect, then, of this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> also, He was gloried before the world was, in order that His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> might be, by the resurrection from the dead, with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, at whose right hand He sits. Accordingly, when He saw that the time of this, His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> glorification, was now come, in order that what had already been done in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> might also be done now in actual accomplishment, He said in His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Your own self with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was:</q> as if He had said, The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You, that is, that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You in Your <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, it is time that I should have with You also in sitting at Your right hand. But as the discussion of this question has already kept us long, what follows must be taken into consideration in another discourse.</p>
