<h1>Tractate 106 (John 17:6-8)</h1>

<p>1. In this discourse we purpose speaking, as He gives us <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, on these words of the Lord which run thus: <q>I have manifested Your name unto the men whom You gave me out of the world.</q> If He said this only of those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with whom He had supped, and to whom, before beginning His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, He had said so much, it can have nothing to do with that clarification, or, as others have translated it, glorification, whereof He was previously speaking, and whereby the Son clarifies or glorifies the Father. For what great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or what like <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, was it to become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to twelve, or rather eleven mortal creatures? But if, in saying, <q>I have manifested Your name unto the men whom You gave me out of the world,</q> He wished all to be understood, even those who were still to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, as belonging to His great Church which was yet to be made up of all nations, and of which it is said in the psalm, <q>I will confess to You in the great Church [congregation];</q>  it is plainly that glorification wherewith the Son glorifies the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He makes His name <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all nations and to so many generations of men. And what He says here, <q>I have manifested Your name unto the men whom You gave me out of the world,</q> is similar to what He had said a little before, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You upon the earth</q>, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse4">John 17:4</a></span>; putting both here and there the past for the future, as One who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be done, and therefore saying that He had done what He had still to do, though without any uncertainty, in the future.</p>

<p>2. But what follows makes it more credible that His words, <q>I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave me out of the world,</q> were spoken by Him of those who were already His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and not of all who were yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. For after these words, He added: <q>Yours they were, and You gave them me; and they have kept Your word. Now they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that all things, whatsoever You have given me, are of You: for I have given unto them the words which You gave me; and they have received them, and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> surely that I came out from You, and they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that You sent me.</q> Although all these words also might have been said of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> still to come, when that which was now a matter of hope had been turned into fact, inasmuch as they were words that still pointed to the future; yet we are impelled the more to understand Him as uttering them only of those who were at that time His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, by what He says shortly afterwards: <q>While I was with them, I kept them in Your name: those that You gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> might be fulfilled</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse12">John 17:12</a></span>; meaning Judas, who betrayed Him, for He was the only one of the apostolic twelve that perished. And then He adds, <q>And now come I to You,</q> from which it is manifest that it was of His own bodily presence that He said, <q>While I was with them, I kept them,</q> as if already that presence were no longer with them. For in this way He wished to intimate His own ascension as in the immediate future, when He said, <q>And now come I to You:</q> going, that is, to the Father's right hand; whence He is hereafter to come to judge the quick and the dead in the self-same bodily presence, according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sound doctrine: for in His spiritual presence He was still, of course, to be with them after His ascension, and with the whole of His Church in this world even to the end of time. <span class="stiki" id="note171716"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> We cannot, therefore, rightly understand of whom He said, <q>While I was with them, I kept them,</q> save as those only who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, whom He had already begun to keep by His bodily presence, but was now to leave without it, in order that He might keep them with the Father by His spiritual presence. Thereafter, indeed, He also unites with them the rest of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He says, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these alone, but for those also who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word.</q> Where He shows still more clearly that He was not speaking before of all who belonged to Him, in the passage where He says, <q>I have manifested Your name unto the men whom You gave me,</q> but of those only who were listening to Him when He so spoke.</p>

<p>3. From the very outset, therefore, of His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, when <q>He lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,</q> on to what He said a little afterwards, <q>And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Your own self with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was,</q> He wished all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be understood, to whom He makes the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and thereby glorifies Him. For after saying, <q>That Your Son may glorify You,</q> He straightway showed how that was to be done, by adding, <q>As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to as many as You have given Him: and this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent.</q> For the Father cannot be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> attained by men, unless He also be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by whom He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, that is to say, by whom He is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the nations of the world. The glorification of the Father is not that which was displayed in connection with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> only, but that which is displayed in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of whom as His members Christ is the head. For the words cannot be understood as applied to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> only, <q>As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to as many as You have given Him;</q> but to all, assuredly, on whom, as believing on Him, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life is bestowed.</p>

<p>4. Accordingly, let us now see what He says about those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of His who were then listening to Him. <q>I have manifested,</q> He says, <q>Your name unto the men whom You gave me.</q> Did they not, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the name of God when they were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And what of that which we read, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judah; His name is great in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q>?  Therefore, <q>I have manifested Your name unto <em>these</em> men whom You gave me out of the world,</q> and who are now hearing my words: not that name of Yours whereby You are called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that whereby You are called my Father: a name that could not be manifested without the manifestation of the Son Himself. For this name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which He is called, could not but be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in some way to the whole creation, and so to every nation, before they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For such is the energy of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, that it cannot be altogether and utterly hidden from any rational creature, so long as it makes use of its reason. For, with the exception of a few in whom nature has become outrageously depraved, the whole race of man acknowledges God as the maker of this world. In respect, therefore, of His being the maker of this world that is visible in heaven and earth around us, God was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto all nations even before they were indoctrinated into the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But in this respect, that He was not, without grievous wrong being done to Himself, to be worshipped alongside of false gods, God was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judah alone. But in respect of His being the Father of this Christ, by whom He takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world, this name of His, previously kept secret from all, He now made manifest to those whom the Father Himself had given Him out of the world. But how had He done so, if the hour were not yet come, of which He had formerly said that the hour would come, <q>when I shall no more speak unto you proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my Father</q>?  Can it be supposed that the proverbs themselves contained such a plain anouncement? Why, then, is it said, <q>I will declare to you openly,</q> but just because that <q>in proverbs</q> is not <q>openly</q>? But when it is no longer concealed in proverbs, but uttered in plain words, then without a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it is spoken openly. How, then, had He manifested what He had not as yet openly declared? It must be understood, therefore, in this way, that the past tense is put for the future, like those other words, <q>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you:</q>  as something He had not yet done, but spoke of as if He had, because His doing of it He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be infallibly pre-determined.</p>

<p>5. But what are we to make of the words, <q>Whom You gave me out of the world</q>? For it is said of them that they were not of the world. But this they attained to by regeneration, and not by generation. And what, also, of that which follows, <q>Yours they were, and You gave them me</q>? Was there a time when they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not to His only-begotten Son; and had the Father once on a time anything apart from the Son? Surely not. Nevertheless, there was a time when God the Son had something, which that same Son as man possessed not; for He had not yet become man of an earthly mother, when He possessed all things in common with the Father. Wherefore in saying, <q>Yours they were,</q> there is thereby no self-disruption made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, apart from whom there was nothing ever possessed by the Father; but it is His custom to attribute all the power He possesses to Him, of whom He Himself is, who has the power. For of whom He has it that He is, of Him He has it that He is able; and both together He always had, for He never had being without having ability. Accordingly, what ever the Father could [do], always side by side with Him could the Son; since He, who never had being without having ability, was never without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the Father never was without Him. And thus, as the Father is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, so is the Son co-eternally <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; and if all-powerful, certainly all-possessing.  For such rather, if we would speak exactly, is the word by which we translate what is called by the Greeks <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;</span> which our writers would not interpret by the term <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, seeing that <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;</span> is all-possessing, were it not that they felt it to be equivalent in meaning. What, then, could the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> all-possessing ever have, that the co-eternal all-possessing had not likewise? In saying, therefore, <q>And You gave them me,</q> He intimated that it was as man He had received this power to have them; seeing that He, who was always <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, was not always man. Accordingly, while He seems rather to have attributed it to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He received them from Him, since all that is, is of Him, of whom He is; yet He also gave them to Himself, that is, Christ, God with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, gave men to the manhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which had not its being with the Father. Finally, He who says in this place, <q>Yours they were, and You gave them me,</q> had already said in a previous passage to the same <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>I have chosen you out of the world.</q>  Here, then, let every carnal thought be crushed and annihilated. The Son says that the men were given Him by the Father out of the world, to whom He says elsewhere, <q>I have chosen you out of the world.</q> Those whom God the Son chose along with the Father out of the world, the very same Son as man received out of the world from the Father; for the Father had not given them to the Son had He not chosen them. And in this way, as the Son did not thereby set the Father aside, when He said, <q>I have chosen you out of the world,</q> seeing that they were simultaneously chosen by the Father also: as little did He thereby exclude Himself, when He said, <q>Yours they were,</q> for they were equally also the property of the Son. But now that same Son as man received those who belonged not to Himself, because He also as God received a servant-form which was not originally His own.</p>

<p>6. He proceeds to say, <q>And they have kept Your word: now they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that all things, whatsoever You have given me, are of You;</q> that is, they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that I am of You. For the Father gave all things at the very time when He begot Him who was to have all things. <q>For I have given unto them,</q> He says, <q>the words which You gave me; and they have received them;</q> that is, they have understood and kept hold of them. For the word is received when it is perceived by the mind. <q>And they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> He adds, <q>that I came out from You, and they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that You sent me.</q> In this last clause we must also supply <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>;</q> for when He said, <q>They have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> He intended its explanation by adding, <q>and they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> That, therefore, <q>they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a></q> which <q>they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>;</q> just as <q>I came out from You</q> is the same as <q>You sent me.</q> When, therefore, He said, <q>They have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> lest any might suppose that such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was already acquired by sight, and not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, He subjoined the explanation, <q>And they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> so that we should supply <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> and understand the saying, <q>They have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> as equivalent to <q>They have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>:</q> not in the way which He intimated shortly before, when He said, <q>Do ye now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? The hour comes, and is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone.</q>  But <q>they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>,</q> that is, in the way it ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, without constraint, with firmness, constancy, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: no longer now to go to their own, and leave Christ alone. As yet, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were not of the character He here describes in words of the past tense, as if they were so already, but as thereby declaring beforehand what sort they were yet to be, namely, when they had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who, according to the promise, should teach them all things. For how was it, before they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that they kept that word of His which He spoke regarding them, as if they had done so, when the chief of them thrice denied Him, <span class="stiki" id="note171723"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse69">Matthew&nbsp;26:69-74</a></span> after hearing from His lips the future <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of the man who denied Him before men? <span class="stiki" id="note171724"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;10:33</a></span> He had given them, therefore, as He said, the words which the Father gave Him; but when at length they received them spiritually, not in an outward way with their ears, but inwardly in their hearts, then they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> received them, for then they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them; and they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, because they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>7. But what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> language will suffice to explain how the Father gave those words to the Son? The question, of course, will appear easier if we suppose Him to have received such words in His capacity as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. And yet, although thus born of the Virgin, who will undertake to relate when and how it was that He learned them, since even that very generation which He had of the Virgin who will venture to declare? But if our idea be that He received these words of the Father in His capacity as begotten of, and co-eternal with, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, let us then exclude all such thoughts of time as if He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previous to His possessing them, and so received the possession of that which He had not before; for whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father gave to God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He gave in the act of begetting. For the Father gave those things to the Son without which He could not be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in the same manner as He gave Him being itself. For how otherwise would He give any words to the Word, wherein in an ineffable way He has spoken all things? But now, in reference to what follows, you must defer your expectations till another discourse.</p>
