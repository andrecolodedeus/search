<h1>Tractate 109 (John 17:20)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord Jesus, in the now close proximity of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom He also named <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, with whom He had partaken of that last supper from which His betrayer had taken his departure on being revealed by the sop of bread, and with whom, after the latter's departure, and before beginning His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in their behalf, He had already spoken at length, conjoined all others also who were yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these alone,</q> that is, for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were with Him at the time, <q>but for them also,</q> He adds, <q>who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word.</q> Whereby He wished all His own to be understood: not only such as were then in the flesh, but those also who were yet to come. For all that have since <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him have doubtless <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and shall yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> till He come, through the word of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; for to themselves He had said, <q>And ye also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, because you have been with me from the beginning;</q>  and by them was the gospel ministered even before it was written, and every one assuredly who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Christ <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> the gospel. Accordingly, those who He says should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through their word, are not to be understood as referring only to such as heard the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves while they lived in the flesh; but others also after their decease, and we, too, born long afterwards, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ through their word. For they that were then with Him preached to the others what they had heard from Him; and so their word, that we too might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, has found its way to us, and wherever His Church exists, and shall yet reach down to posterity, whoever and wherever they be who shall hereafter <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</p>

<p>2. In this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, therefore, Jesus may seem to have omitted <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for some of His own, unless we carefully examine His words in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> itself. For if He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> first for those, as we have already shown, who were then with Him, and afterwards for those also who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through their word, it may be said that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> not for those who were neither with Him when He so spoke, nor afterwards <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> through their word, but had done so at some previous time either of themselves, or in some other supposable manner. For was Nathanael with Him at that time?  Was Joseph of Arimathea, who begged His body from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and of whom this same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John testifies that he was already His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>?  Were His mother, Mary, and other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, had been prior to that time His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? Were those with Him then, of whom this <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John frequently says, <q>Many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him</q>?  For whence came the multitude of those who, with branches of trees, partly preceded and partly followed Him as He sat on the ass, saying, <q>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord;</q> and along with them the children of whom He Himself declared that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> had been uttered, <q>Out of the mouth of babes and of sucklings You have perfected praise</q>?  Whence the five hundred brethren, to all of whom at once He would not have appeared after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> <span class="stiki" id="note171746"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:6</a></span> had they not previously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him? Whence that hundred and nine who, with the eleven, were a hundred and twenty, when, being assembled together after His ascension, they waited and received the promise of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?  Whence came all these, save from those of Whom it was said, <q>Many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him</q>? For them, therefore, the Saviour did not at this time <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, seeing it was for those He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> who were then with Him, and for others not who had already, but who were yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through their word. But these were certainly not with Him on that occasion, and had already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him at some previous period. I say nothing of the aged Simeon, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him when an infant; of Anna the prophetess; <span class="stiki" id="note171748"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;2:25-38</a></span> of Zachariah and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, who prophesied of Him before He was born of the Virgin;  of their son John, His forerunner, the friend of the Bridegroom, who both recognized Him in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and preached Him in His absence, and pointed Him out when He was present to the recognition of others; &mdash; I say nothing of these, as it might be replied that He ought not to have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for such when dead, who had gone hence with their great merits, and having met with a welcome reception were now at rest; for a similar answer is also given in connection with the righteous of olden time. For which of them could have been saved from the damnation awaiting the whole mass of perdition, which has been caused by one man, had he not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, through the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in the one Mediator between God and men as yet to come in the flesh? But behooved He to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for so many who were still alive, but were not then with Him, and had already at some previous period been brought to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Who is there that would say so?</p>

<p>3. We are therefore to understand that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him was not yet such as He wished it to be, inasmuch as even Peter himself, to whom, on making the confession, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> He had borne so excellent a testimony, was disposed rather to hinder Him from dying than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> when dead, and hence was called immediately thereafter by the same of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.  Those, accordingly, are found to be the greater in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> who were long since deceased, and yet, through the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, had no manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Christ would rise again, than those who, after attaining to the belief that He should redeem <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, at the sight of His death lost all the hope they previously possessed regarding Him. The best thing for us, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is, that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was bestowed, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> taught and confirmed, and from its outset constituted teachers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, others, through their word, attained the proper <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or, in other words, that they then got firm hold of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And in this way also, that all those who seemed to have already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him really belonged to the number of those for whom He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, when He said, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these alone, but for them also who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word.</q></p>

<p>4. But we have still in reserve for the further solution of this question the blessed apostle, and that robber who was a villain in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but a believer on the cross. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> tells us that he was made an apostle not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: and speaking of his own gospel, he says, <q>For I neither received it of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, neither did I learn it, but by the revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  How then was he among those of whom it is said, <q>They shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word</q>? On the other hand, the robber <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at the very time when in the case of the teachers themselves such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as they previously possessed had utterly failed. Not even he, therefore, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ through their word, and yet his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was such that he confessed that He whom he saw nailed to the cross would not only rise again, but would also reign, when he said, <q>Remember me when You come into Your kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171753"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;23:42</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Accordingly it remains that if we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, in this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,  we must so understand the expression, <q>through their word,</q> as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it here signified the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> received that same word of theirs by the revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Whence also it came about that he compared the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.  And in regard to this word of the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is said by the same apostle, <q>Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171756"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:11</a></span> and again, <q>This is the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> he says, <q>which we preach, that if you shall confess with your mouth that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Lord, and shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171757"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;10:8-9</a></span> And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, God has marked out [the ground of] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that He has raised Him from the dead. <span class="stiki" id="note171758"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse31">Acts&nbsp;17:31</a></span> Accordingly, this word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because principally and primarily preached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him <q>not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but, as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171759"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> <q>Of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> for the very reason that it was freely given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but called <q>their word,</q> because primarily and principally committed to them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was brought to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the reply given by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: <q>It is not good that we should leave the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve tables.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171760"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;6:1-4</a></span> Then it was that they provided for the ordination of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for by our Redeemer when, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.</p>
