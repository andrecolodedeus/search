<h1>Tractate 10 (John 2:12-21)</h1>

<p>1. In the psalm you have heard the groaning of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whose members endure tribulations over the whole earth, even unto the end of the world. Make it your chief business, my brethren, to be among and of these members: for all tribulation is to pass away. <q>Woe to them that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170229"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;6:25</a></span> <q>Blessed,</q> says the Truth, <q>are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</q> God has become man: what shall man be, for whom God has become man? Let this hope comfort us in every tribulation and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of this life. For the enemy does not cease to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>; and when he does not openly rage, he plots in secret. How does he plot? <q>And for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, they worked deceitfully.</q>  Thence is he called a lion and a dragon. But what is said to Christ? <q>You shall tread on the lion and the dragon.</q> Lion, for open rage; dragon, for hidden treachery. The dragon cast <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of Paradise; as a lion, the same <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as Peter says: <q>For your adversary, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170231"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Let it not seem to you as if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had lost his ferocity. When he blandly flatters, then is he the more vigilantly to be guarded against. But amid all these treacherous devices and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of his, what shall we do but that which we have heard in the psalm: <q>And I, when they were troublesome to me, clothed me in sackcloth, and humbled my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</q>  There is one that hears <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, hesitate not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; but He that hears abides within. You need not direct your eyes towards some mountain; you need not raise your face to the stars, or to the sun, or to the moon; nor must you suppose that you are heard when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> beside the sea: rather detest such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Only cleanse the chamber of your heart; wheresoever you are, wherever you pray. He that hears is within, within in the secret place, which the psalmist calls his bosom, when he says, <q>And my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be turned in my own bosom.</q>  He that hears you is not beyond you; you have not to travel far, nor to lift yourself up, so as to reach Him as it were with your hands. Rather, if you lift yourself up, you shall fall; if you <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> yourself, He will draw near you. Our Lord God is here, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the Word made flesh, the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; the lofty One to make us, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> to make us anew, walking among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, bearing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, concealing the divine.</p>

<p>2. <q>He went down,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, <q>to Capernaum, He, and His mother, and His brethren, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and they continued there not many days.</q> Behold He has a mother, and brethren, and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: whence He has a mother, thence brethren. For our Scripture is wont to call them brethren, not only that are sprung from the same man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or from the same mother, or from the same father, though by different mothers; or, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that are of the same degree as cousins by the father's or mother's side: not these alone is our Scripture wont to call brethren. The Scripture must be understood as it speaks. It has its own language; one who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this language is perplexed and says, Whence had the Lord brethren? For surely Mary did not give birth a second time? Far from it! With her begins the dignity of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. She could be a mother, but a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of man she could not be. She is spoken of as <em> mulier</em> [which usually signifies a <em>wife</em>], but only in reference to her sex, not as implying loss of virgin purity: and this follows from the language of Scripture itself. For Eve, too, immediately she was formed from the side of her husband, and as yet not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of her husband, is, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, called mulier: <q>And he made her a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> [mulier].</q> Then, whence the brethren? The kinsmen of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, of whatever degree, are the brethren of the Lord. How do we prove this? From Scripture itself. <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> is called <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> brother;</q>  he was his brother's son. Read, and you will find that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> uncle on the father's side, and yet they are called brethren. Why, but because they were kinsmen? Laban the Syrian was Jacob's uncle by the mother's side, for he was the brother of Rebecca, Isaac's wife and Jacob's mother. <span class="stiki" id="note170235"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;28:5</a></span> Read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and you will find that uncle and sister's son are called brothers. <span class="stiki" id="note170236"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;29:12-15</a></span> When you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this rule, you will find that all the blood relations of Mary are the brethren of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. But rather were those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> brethren; for even those kinsmen would not be brethren were they not <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: and to no advantage brethren, if they did not recognize their brother as their master. For in a certain place, when He was informed that His mother and His brethren were standing without, at the time He was speaking to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He said: <q>Who is my mother? Or who are my brethren? And stretching out His hand over His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He said, These are my brethren;</q> and, <q>Whosoever shall do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father, the same is my mother, and brother, and sister.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170237"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;12:46-50</a></span> Therefore also Mary, because she did the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. What the Lord magnified in her was, that she did the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not that flesh gave birth to flesh. Give good heed, beloved. Moreover, when the Lord was regarded with admiration by the multitude, while doing signs and wonders, and showing forth what lay concealed under the flesh, certain admiring <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> said: <q>Happy is the womb that bare You: and He said, Yea, rather, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> are they that hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keep it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170238"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;11:27</a></span> That is to say, even my mother, whom you have called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in that she keeps the word of God: not because in her the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt in us; but because she keeps that same word of God by which she was made, and which in her was made flesh. Let not men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in temporal offspring, but let them exult if in spirit they are joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We have spoken these things on account of that which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, that He dwelt in Capernaum a few days, with His mother, and His brethren, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>4. What follows upon this? <q>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> passover was at hand; and He went up to Jerusalem.</q> The narrator relates another matter, as it came to his recollection. <q>And He found in the temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting: and when He had made, as it were, a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple; the oxen likewise, and the sheep; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; and make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</q> What have we heard, brethren? See, that temple was still a figure, and yet the Lord cast out of it all that sought their own, all who had come to market. And what did they sell there? Things which people needed in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of that time. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, beloved, that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were given to that people, in consideration of the carnal mind and stony heart yet in them, to keep them from falling away to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: and they offered there for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> oxen, sheep, and doves: you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, for you have read it. It was not a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then, if they sold in the temple that which was bought for the purpose of offering in the temple: and yet He cast them out thence. If, while they were selling what was lawful and not against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (for it is not unlawful to sell what it is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> to buy), He nevertheless drove those men out, and suffered not the house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be made a house of merchandise; how, if He found drunkards there, what would the Lord do? If the house of God ought not to be made a house of trading, ought it to be made a house of drinking? But when we say this, they gnash upon us with their teeth; but the psalm which you have heard comforts us: <q>They gnashed upon me with their teeth.</q> Yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how we may be cured, although the strokes of the lash are multiplied on Christ, for His word is made to bear the scourge: <q>The scourges,</q> says He, <q>were gathered together against me, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not.</q> He was scourged by the scourges of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; He is now scourged by the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of false <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: they multiply scourges for their Lord, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not. Let us, so far as He aids us, do as the psalmist did: <q>But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</q> </p>

<p>5. Yet we say, brethren (for He did not spare those men: He who was to be scourged by them first scourged them), that He gave us a certain sign, in that He made a scourge of small cords, and with it lashed the unruly, who were making merchandise of God's temple. For indeed every man twists for himself a rope by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: <q>Woe to them who draw <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as a long rope?</q>  Who makes a long rope? He who adds <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. How are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> added to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? When the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have been committed are covered over by other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. One has committed a theft: that he may not be found out to have committed it, he seeks the astrologer. It were enough to have committed theft: why will you add <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Behold two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed. When you are forbidden to go to the astrologer, you revile the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: behold three <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. When you hear it said of you, Cast him forth from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; you say, I will betake me to the party of Donatus: behold you add a fourth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The rope is growing; be afraid of the rope. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for you to be corrected here, when you are scourged with it; that it may not be said of you at the last, <q>Bind ye his hands and feet, and cast him forth into outer darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170241"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;22:3</a></span> For, <q>With the cords of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is every one bound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170242"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;5:22</a></span> The former of these is the saying of the Lord, the latter that of another Scripture; but yet both are the sayings of the Lord. With their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are men bound and cast into outer darkness.</p>

<p>6. However, to seek the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the deed in the figure, who are they that sell oxen? Who are they that sell sheep and doves? They are they who seek their own in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not the things which are Christ's. They account all a matter of sale, while they will not be redeemed: they have no wish to be bought, and yet they wish to sell. Yes; good indeed is it for them that they may be redeemed by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they may come to the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now, what does it profit to acquire in this world any temporal and transitory thing whatsoever, be it money, or pleasure of the palate, or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that consists in the praise of men? Are they not all wind and smoke? Do they not all pass by and flee away? Are they not all as a river rushing headlong into the sea? And woe to him who shall fall into it, for he shall be swept into the sea. Therefore ought we to curb all our affections from such desires. My brethren, they that seek such things are they that sell. For that Simon too, wished to buy the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, just because he meant to sell the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and he thought the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to be just such traders as they whom the Lord cast out of the temple with a scourge. For such an one he was himself, and desired to buy what he might sell: he was of those who sell doves. Now it was in a dove that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared. <span class="stiki" id="note170243"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span> Who, then, are they, brethren, that sell doves, but they who say, <q>We give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q>? But why do they say this, and at what price do they sell? At the price of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to themselves. They receive as the price, temporal seats of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, that they may be seen to be sellers of doves. Let them beware of the scourge of small cords. The dove is not for sale: it is given freely; for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or favor, it is called. Therefore, my brethren, just as you see them that sell, common chapmen, each cries up what he sells: how many stalls they have set up! Primianus has a stall at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Maximianus has another, Rogatus has another in Mauritania, they have another in Numidia, this party and that, which it is not in our power now to name. Accordingly,one goes round to buy the dove, and everyone at his own stall cries up what he sells. Let the heart of such an one turn away from every seller; let him come where he receives freely. Aye, brethren, and they do not blush, that, by these bitter and malicious dissensions of theirs, they have made of themselves so many parties, while they assume to be what they are not, while they are lifted up, thinking themselves to be something when they are nothing. <span class="stiki" id="note170244"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> But what is fulfilled in them, since that they will not be corrected, but that which you have heard in the psalm: <q>They were rent asunder, and felt no remorse</q>?</p>

<p>7. Well, who sell oxen? They who have dispensed to us the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> are understood to mean the oxen. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were oxen, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were oxen. Whence the apostle says: <q>You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the grain. Does God take care for oxen? Or says He it for our sakes? Yea, for our sakes He says it: that he who plowes should plow in hope; and he that threshes, in hope of partaking.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170245"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:9-10</a></span> Those oxen, then, have left to us the narration of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For it was not of their own that they dispensed, because they sought the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. Now, what have ye heard in that psalm? <q>And let them say continually, The Lord be magnified, they that wish the peace of His servant.</q>  God's servant, God's people, God's Church. Let them who wish the peace of that Church magnify the Lord, not the servant: <q>and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified.</q> Who, let say? <q>Them who wish the peace of His servant.</q> The voice of that people, of that servant, is clearly that voice which you have heard in lamentations in the psalm, and were moved at hearing, because you are of that people. What was sung by one, re-echoed from the hearts of all. Happy they who recognized themselves in those voices as in a mirror. Who, then, are they that wish the peace of His servant, the peace of His people, the peace of the one whom He calls His <q>only one,</q> and whom He wishes to be delivered from the lion: <q>Deliver mine only one from the power of the dog?</q>  They who say always, <q>The Lord be magnified.</q> Those oxen, then, magnified the Lord, not themselves. See this ox magnifying his Lord, because <q>the ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170248"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> observe that ox in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest men desert the ox's owner and rely on the ox: how he dreads them that are willing to put their confidence in him: <q>Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were ye <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170249"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> Of what I gave, I was not the giver: freely you have received; the dove came down from heaven. <q>I have planted,</q> says he, <q>Apollo, watered; but God gave the increase: neither he that plants is anything, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170250"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> <q>And let them say always, The Lord be magnified, they that wish the peace of His servant.</q></p>

<p>8. These men, however, deceive the people by the very Scriptures, that they may receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and praises at their hand, and that men may not turn to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But in that they deceive, by the very Scriptures, the people of whom they seek <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, they do in fact sell oxen: they sell sheep too; that is, the common people themselves. And to whom do they sell them, but to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? For if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be Christ's sole and only one, who is it that carries off whatever is cut away from it, but that lion that roars and goes about, <q>seeking whom he may devour?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170251"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Woe to them that are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! As for her, she will remain entire. <q>For the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170252"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> These, however, so far as they can, sell oxen and sheep, they sell doves too: let them guard against the scourge of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But when they suffer some such things for these their iniquities, let them acknowledge that the Lord has made a scourge of small cords, and is admonishing them to change themselves and be no longer traffickers: for if they will not change, they shall at the end hear it said, <q>Bind ye these men's hands and feet, and cast them forth into outer darkness.</q></p>

<p>9. <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> remembered that it was written, The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Your house has eaten me up:</q> because by this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house, the Lord cast these men out of the temple. Brethren, let every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> among the members of Christ be eaten up with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house. Who is eaten up with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house? He who exerts himself to have all that he may happen to see wrong there corrected, desires it to be mended, does not rest idle: who if he cannot mend it, endures it, laments it. The grain is not shaken out on the threshing-floor that it may enter the barn when the chaff shall have been separated. If you are a grain, be not shaken out from the floor before the putting into the granary; lest you be picked up by the birds before you be gathered into the granary. For the birds of heaven, the powers of the air, are waiting to snatch up something off the threshing-floor, and they can snatch up only what has been shaken out of it. Therefore, let the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house eat you up: let the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house eat up every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of that house of God of which he is a member. For your own house is not more important than that wherein you have everlasting rest. You go into your own house for temporal rest, you enter God's house for everlasting rest. If, then, you busy yourself to see that nothing wrong be done in your own house, is it fit that you suffer, so far as you can help, if you should chance to see anything wrong in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is set before you, and rest without end? For example, do you see a brother rushing to the theatre? Stop him, warn him, make him sorry, if the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of God's house does eat you up. Do you see others running and desiring to get drunk, and that, too, in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, which is not decent to be done in any place? Stop those whom you can, restrain whom you can, frighten whom you can, allure gently whom you can, do not, however, rest silent. Is it a friend? Let him be admonished gently. Is it a wife? Let her be bridled with the utmost rigor. Is it a maid-servant? Let her be curbed even with blows. Do whatever you can for the part you bear, and so you fulfill. <q>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Your house has eaten me up.</q> But if you will be cold, languid, having regard only to yourself, and as if yourself were enough to you, and saying in your heart, What have I to do with looking after other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Enough for me is the care of my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: this let me keep undefiled for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;come, does there not recur to your mind the case of that servant who hid his talent and would not lay it out? Was he accused because he lost it, and not because he kept it without profit? <span class="stiki" id="note170253"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;25:25-30</a></span> So hear ye then, my brethren, that you may not rest idle. I am about to give you counsel: may He who is within give it; for though it be through me, it is He that gives it. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to do, each one of you, in his own house, with his friend, his tenant, his client, with greater, with less: as God grants an entrance, as He opens a door for His word, do not cease to win for Christ; because you were won by Christ.</p>

<p>10. <q>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said unto Him, What sign do you show unto us, seeing that you do these things?</q> And the Lord answered, <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and do you say, In three days I will rear it up?</q> Flesh they were, fleshly things they minded; but He was speaking spiritually. But who could understand of what temple He spoke? But yet we have not far to seek; He has discovered it to us through the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, he has told us of what temple He said it. <q>But He spoke,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, <q>of the temple of His body.</q> And it is manifest that, being slain, the Lord did rise again after three days. This is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us all now: and if from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> it is concealed, it is because they stand without; yet to us it is open, because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. The destroying and rearing again of that temple, we are about to celebrate in its yearly <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>: for which we exhort you to prepare yourselves, such of you as are <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> that you may receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; even now is the time, even now let that be purposed which may then come to the birth. Now, that thing we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>

<p>11. But perhaps this is demanded of us, whether the fact that the temple was forty and six years in building may not have in it some <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. There are, indeed, many things that may be said of this matter; but what may briefly be said, and easily understood, that we say meanwhile. Brethren, we have said yesterday, if I mistake not, that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was one man, and is yet the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For thus we said, if you remember. He was broken, as it were, in pieces; and, being scattered, is now being gathered together, and, as it were, conjoined into one by a spiritual fellowship and concord. And <q>the poor that groan,</q> as one man, is that same Adam, but in Christ he is being renewed: because an <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has come without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in His own flesh, and that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> might renew to himself the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> then is Christ's flesh: of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the temple which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> destroyed, and the Lord raised up in three days. For He raised His own flesh: see, that He was thus God equal with the Father. My brethren, the apostle says, <q>Who raised Him from the dead.</q> Of whom says he this? Of the Father. <q>He became,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore also God raised Him from the dead, and gave Him a name which is above every name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170254"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> He who was raised and exalted is the Lord. Who raised Him? The Father, to whom He said in the psalms, <q>Raise me up and I will requite them.</q>  Hence, the Father raised Him up. Did He not raise Himself? And does the Father anything without the Word? What does the Father without His only One? For, hear that He also was God. <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</q> Did He say, Destroy the temple, which in three days the Father will raise up? But as when the Father raises, the Son also raises; so when the Son raises, the Father also raises: because the Son has said, <q>I and the Father are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170256"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> </p>

<p>12. Now, what does the number Forty-six mean? Meanwhile, how <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> extends over the whole globe, you have already heard explained yesterday, by the four Greek letters of four Greek words. For if you write the four words, one under the other, that is, the names of the four quarters of the world, of east, west, north, and south, which is the whole globe&mdash;whence the Lord says that He will gather His elect from the four winds when He shall come to judgment; <span class="stiki" id="note170257"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse27">Mark&nbsp;13:27</a></span> &mdash; if, I say, you take these four Greek words&mdash;<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x1F74;</span>, which is east; <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>, which is west; <span class="greek">&#x1F04;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, which is north; <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B2;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, which is south; Anatole, Dysis, Arctos, Mesembria,&mdash; the first letters of the words make Adam. How, then, do we find there, too, the number forty-six? Because Christ's flesh was of Adam. The Greeks compute numbers by letters. What we make the letter A, they in their tongue put Alpha, <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span>, and Alpha, <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span>, is called one. And where in numbers they write Beta, <span class="greek">&#x03B2;</span>, which is their <em><span class="greek">b</span> </em>, it is called in numbers two. Where they write Gamma, <span class="greek">&#x03B3;</span>, it is called in their numbers three. Where they write Delta, <span class="greek">&#x03B4;</span>, it is called in their numbers four; and so by means of all the letters they have numbers. The letter we call M, and they call My, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;</span>, signifies forty; for they say My, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span> . Now look at the number which these letters make, and you will find in it that the temple was built in forty-six years. For the word <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has Alpha, <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span>, which is one: it has Delta, <span class="greek">&#x03B4;</span>, which is four; there are five for you: it has Alpha, <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span>, again, which is one; there are six for you: it has also My, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;</span>, which is forty; there have you forty-six. These things, my brethren, were said by our elders before us, and that number forty-six was found by them in letters. And because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> took of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> a body, not of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> derived <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; took of him a corporeal temple, not iniquity which must be driven from the temple: and that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> crucified that very flesh which He derived from Adam (for Mary was of Adam, and the Lord's flesh was of Mary); and that, further, He was in three days to raise that same flesh which they were about to slay on the cross: they destroyed the temple which was forty-six years in building, and that temple He raised up in three days.</p>

<p>13. We bless the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gathered us together to spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Let us be ever in humility of heart, and let our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be with Him. Let us not be elated with any prosperity of this world, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not until these things shall have passed way. Now, my brethren, let our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be in hope: let none <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as in a present thing, lest he stick fast in the way. Let <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be wholly of hope to come, desire be wholly of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Let all sighings breathe after Christ. Let that fairest one alone, who loved the foul to make them fair, be all our desire; after Him alone let us run, for Him alone pant and sigh; <q>and let them say always, The Lord be magnified, that wish the peace of His servant.</q></p>
