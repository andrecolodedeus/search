<h1>Tractate 112 (John 18:1-12)</h1>

<p>1. When the grand and lengthened discourse was concluded which the Lord delivered after supper, and on the eve of shedding His blood for us, to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were then with Him, and had added the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> addressed to His Father, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John began thereafter the narrative of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> in these words: <q>When Jesus had so spoken, He went forth with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the place; for Jesus oft-times resorted there with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> What he here relates of the Lord entering the garden with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not take place immediately after He had brought the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to a close, of which he says, <q>When Jesus had spoken these words:</q> but certain other incidents were interposed, which are passed over by the present <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and found in the others; just as in this one are found many things on which the others are similarly silent in their own narratives. But any one who desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how they all agree together, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is advanced by one is never contradicted by another, may seek for what he wants, not in these present discourses, but in other elaborate treatises;  but he will master the subject not by standing and listening, but rather by sitting down and reading, or by giving his closest attention and thought to one who does so. Yet let him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> before he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, whether he be able also to come to such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in this life, or find it impossible through some existing entanglements, that there is nothing written by any one <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, as far as regards those who have been received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into canonical authority, that can be contrary to his own or another's equally veracious narrative. At present, therefore, let us look at the narrative of the blessed John, which we have undertaken to expound, without any comparison with the others, and without lingering over anything in it that is already sufficiently clear; so that where it is needful to do so, we may the better answer the demand. Let us, therefore, not take His words, <q>When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> as if it were immediately after the utterance of these words that He entered the garden; but let the clause, <q>When Jesus had spoken these words,</q> bear this meaning, that we are not to suppose Him entering the garden before He had brought these words to a close.</p>

<p>2. <q>Judas also,</q> he says, <q>who betrayed Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the place;  for Jesus oft-times resorted there with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> There, accordingly, the wolf, clad in a sheep's skin, and tolerated among the sheep by the profound counsel of the Father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, learned where he might opportunely scatter the slender flock, and lay his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> snares for the Shepherd. <q>Judas then,</q> he adds, <q>having received a cohort, and officers from the chief men and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, comes there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.</q> It was a cohort, not of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but of soldiers. We are therefore to understand it as having been received from the governor, as if for the purpose of securing the person of a criminal, and by preserving the forms of legal power, to deter any from venturing to resist his captors: although at the same time so great a band had been assembled, and came armed in such a way as either to terrify or even attack any one who should dare to make a stand in Christ's defense. For only in so far was His power concealed and prominence given to His weakness, that these very measures were deemed necessary by His enemies to be taken against Him, for whose hurt nothing would have sufficed but what was pleasing to Himself; in His own goodness making a good use of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and doing what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in regard to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that He might transform the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> into the good, and distinguish between the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>3. <q>Jesus, therefore,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> proceeds to say, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things that should come upon Him, went forth and says unto them, Whom do you seek? They answered Him, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. Jesus says unto them, I am [He]. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, stood with them. As soon then as He had said unto them, I am He, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</q> Where now were the military cohort, and the servants of the chief men and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>? Where the terror and protection of weapons? His own single voice uttering the words, <q>I am [He],</q> without any weapon, smote, repelled, prostrated that great crowd, with all the ferocity of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and terror of their arms. For God lay hid in that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh; and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> day was so obscured in those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> limbs, that with lanterns and torches He was sought for to be slain by the darkness. <q>I am [He],</q> He says; and He casts the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to the ground. What will He do when He comes as judge, who did this when giving Himself up to be judged? What will be His power when He comes to reign, who had this power when He came to die? And now everywhere through the gospel Christ is still saying, <q>I am [He];</q> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are looking for antichrist, that they may go backward and fall to the ground, as those who have abandoned what is heavenly, and are hankering after the earthly. It was for the very purpose of apprehending Jesus that His persecutors accompanied the traitor: they found the One they were seeking, for they heard, <q>I am [He].</q> Why, then, did they not seize Him, but went backward and fell, but just because so He pleased, who could do whatever He pleased? But had He never permitted them to apprehend Him, they would certainly not have done what they came to do, but no more would He be doing what He came to do. They, verily, in their mad rage, sought for Him to put Him to death; but He, too, in giving Himself to death, was seeking for us. Accordingly, having thus shown His power to those who had the will, but not the power, to hold Him; let them now hold Him that He may work His own will with those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not.</p>

<p>4. <q>Then asked He them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [He]. If therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, That of those whom You have given me I have lost none.</q> <q>If you seek me,</q> He says, <q>let these go their way.</q> He sees His enemies,  and they do what He bids them: they let those go their way, whom He would not have perish. But were they not afterwards to die? How then, if they died now, should He lose them, were it not that as yet they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, as all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> who perish not?</p>

<p>5. <q>Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, having a sword, drew it, and smote the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> servant, and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.</q> This is the only <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> who has given us the very name of this servant, as Luke is the only one who tells us that the Lord touched his ear and healed him. <span class="stiki" id="note171806"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;22:51</a></span> The interpretation of Malchus is, one who is destined to reign. What, then, is signified by the ear that was cut off in the Lord's behalf, and healed by the Lord, but the renewed hearing that has been pruned of its oldness, that it may henceforth be in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter? <span class="stiki" id="note171807"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;7:6</a></span> Who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he, who had such a thing done for him by Christ, was yet destined to reign with Christ? And his being found as a servant, pertains also to that oldness that genders to bondage, which is Agar. <span class="stiki" id="note171808"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;4:24</a></span> But when healing came, liberty also was shadowed forth. Peter's deed, however, was disapproved of by the Lord, and He prevented Him from proceeding further by the words: <q>Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</q> For in such a deed that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> only sought to defend his Master, without any thought of what it was intended to signify. And he had therefore to be exhorted to the exercise of patience, and the event itself to be recorded as an exercise of understanding. But when He says that the cup of suffering was given Him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we have precisely the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as that which was uttered by the apostle: <q>If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171809"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;8:31-32</a></span> But the originator of this cup is also one with Him who drank it; and hence the same apostle likewise says, <q>Christ loved us, and gave Himself for us an offering and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God of a sweet-smelling savor.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171810"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> </p>

<p>6. <q>Then the cohort, and the tribune, and the officers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, took Jesus, and bound Him.</q> They took Him to whom they had never found access: for He continued the day, while they remained as darkness; neither had they given heed to the words, <q>Come unto Him, and be enlightened.</q>  For had they so approached Him, they would have taken Him, not with their hands for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, but with their hearts for the purpose of a welcome reception. Now, however, when they laid hold of Him in this way, their distance from Him was vastly in creased: and they bound Him by whom they themselves ought rather to have been loosed. And perhaps there were those among them who then fastened their fetters on Christ, and yet were afterwards delivered by Him, and could say, <q>You have loosed my bonds.</q>  Let this be enough for today; we shall deal, God willing, with what follows in another discourse.</p>
