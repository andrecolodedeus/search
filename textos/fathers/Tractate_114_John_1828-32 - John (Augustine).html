<h1>Tractate 114 (John 18:28-32)</h1>

<p>1. Let us now consider, so far as indicated by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, what was done with, or in regard to, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when brought before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> the governor. For he returns to the place of his narrative where he had left it, to explain the denial of Peter. He had already, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, said, <q>And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> sent Him bound unto <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>:</q> and having returned from where he had dismissed Peter as he was warming himself at the fire in the hall, after completing the whole of his denial, which was thrice repeated, he says, <q>Then they bring Jesus unto <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>  into the hall of judgment (pretorium);</q> for he had said that He was sent to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> by his colleague and father-in-law <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>. But if to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, why into the hall of judgment? Nothing else is thereby meant to be understood than the place where <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the governor dwelt. And therefore, either for some urgent reason <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> had proceeded from the house of <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>, where both had met to give Jesus a hearing, to the governor's pretorium, and had left the hearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to his father-in-law; or <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had made his pretorium in the house of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, which was so large as to contain separate apartments for its own master, and the like for the judge.</p>

<p>2. <q>And it was morning; and they themselves,</q> that is, those who brought Jesus, <q>went not into the judgment hall,</q> to wit, into that part of the house which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> occupied, supposing it to be <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas'</a> house. And then in explanation of the reason why they went not into the judgment hall, he says, <q>lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</q> For it was the commencement of the days of unleavened bread: on which they accounted it defilement to enter the abode of one of another nation. Impious blindness! Would they, forsooth, be defiled by a stranger's abode, and not be defiled by their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? They were afraid of being defiled by the pretorium of a foreign judge, and had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of defilement from the blood of an innocent brother: not to say more than this meanwhile, which was enough to fix guilt on the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For the additional fact, that it was the Lord who was led to death by their impiety, and the giver of life that was on the way to be slain, may be charged, not to their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but to their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>3. <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you.</q> Let the question be put to, and the answer come from, those who had been delivered from foul spirits, from the sickly who had been healed, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> who had been cleansed, the deaf who were hearing, the dumb who were speaking, the blind who were seeing, the dead who were raised to life, and, above all, the foolish who had become wise, whether Jesus were a malefactor. But these things were said by those of whom He Himself had already foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>They rewarded me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good.</q> </p>

<p>4. <q>Then said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.</q> What is this that their insane cruelty says? Did not they put Him to death, whom they were here presenting for the very purpose? Or does the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, forsooth, fail to kill? Such is the folly of those who do not pursue, but <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> wisdom. What then mean the words, <q>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death</q>? If He is a malefactor, why is it not lawful? Did not the law command them not to spare malefactors, especially (as they accounted Him to be) those who seduced them from their God?  We are, however, to understand that they said that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the festal day, which they had just begun to celebrate, and on account of which they were afraid of being defiled even by entering the pretorium. Had you become so hardened, false <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>? Were you by your excessive <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> so lost to all sense, as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you were unpolluted by the blood of the innocent, because you gave it up to be shed by another? Was even <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> himself going to slay Him with his own hands, when made over by you into his power for the very purpose? If you did not wish Him to be slain; if you did not lay snares for Him; if you did not get Him to be betrayed to you for money; if you did not lay hands upon Him, and bind Him, and bring Him there; if you did not with your own hands present Him, and with your voices demand Him to be slain,&mdash; then boast that He was not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by you. But if in addition to all these former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of yours, you also cried out, <q>Crucify, crucify [him];</q>  then hear what it is against you that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> proclaims: <q>The sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</q>  These, look you, are the spears, the arrows, the sword, wherewith you slew the righteous, when you said that it was not lawful for you to put any man to death. Hence it is also that when for the purpose of apprehending Jesus the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did not themselves come, but sent; yet the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Luke says in the same passage of his narrative, <q>Then said Jesus unto those who had come to him, [namely] the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and captains of the temple, and elders, Be come out, as against a thief,</q> etc? <span class="stiki" id="note171836"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;22:52</a></span> As therefore the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went not in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but by those whom they had sent, to apprehend Jesus, what else was that but coming themselves in the authority of their own order and so all, who cried out with impious voices for the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, slew Him, not, indeed, directly with their own hands, but personally through him who was impelled to such a crime by their clamor.</p>

<p>5. But when the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John adds, <q>That the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying what death He should die:</q> if we would understand such words as referring to the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, as if the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had said, <q>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</q> for this reason that it was one thing to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and another to be crucified: I do not see how such can be understood as a consequence, seeing that this was their answer to the words that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had just addressed to them, <q>Take ye him, and judge him according to your law.</q> If it were so, could they not then have taken Him, and crucified Him themselves, had they desired by any such form of punishment to avoid the putting of Him to death? But who is there that may not see the absurdity of allowing those to crucify any one, who were not allowed to put any one to death? Nay more, did not the Lord Himself call that same death of His, that is, the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, a putting to death, as we read in Mark, where he says, <q>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be delivered unto the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and unto the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>; and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and they shall mock Him, and shall spit upon Him, and shall scourge Him, and shall put Him to death, and the third day He shall rise again</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note171837"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse33">Mark&nbsp;10:33-34</a></span> There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, therefore, that in so speaking the Lord signified what death He should die: not that He here meant the death of the cross to be understood, but that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were to deliver Him up to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, or, in other words, to the Romans. For <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was a Roman, and had been sent by the Romans into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> as governor. That, then, this saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might be fulfilled, namely, that, being delivered up to them, He should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as Jesus had foretold would happen; therefore when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who was the Roman judge, wished to hand Him back to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that they might judge Him according to their law, they refused to receive Him, saying, <q>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.</q> And so the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was fulfilled, which He foretold concerning His death, that, being delivered up by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, He should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: whose crime was less than that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who sought by this method to make themselves appear averse to His being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, to the end that, not their innocence, but their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> might be made manifest.</p>
