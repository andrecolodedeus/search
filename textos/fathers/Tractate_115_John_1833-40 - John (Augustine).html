<h1>Tractate 115 (John 18:33-40)</h1>

<p>1. What <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or what He replied to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, has to be considered and handled in the present discourse. For after the words had been addressed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Take ye him, and judge him according to your law,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had replied, <q>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> entered again into the judgment hall, and called Jesus, and said unto Him, Are you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And Jesus answered, Do you say this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?</q> The Lord indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both what He Himself asked, and what reply the other was to give; but yet He wished it to be spoken, not for the sake of information to Himself, but that what He wished us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> might be recorded in Scripture. <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, have delivered you unto me: what have you done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</q> This is what the good Master wished us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but first there had to be shown us the vain notion that men had regarding His kingdom, whether <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, from whom <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had heard it; as if He ought to have been punished with death on the ground of aspiring to an unlawful kingdom; or as those in the possession of royal power usually manifest their ill-will to such as are yet to attain it, as if, for example, precautions were to be used lest His kingdom should prove adverse either to the Romans or to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But the Lord was able to reply to the first question of the governor, when he asked Him, <q>Are you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> with the words, <q>My kingdom is not of this world,</q> etc.; but by questioning him in turn, whether he said this thing of himself, or heard it from others, He wished by his answer to show that He had been charged with this as a crime before him by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: laying open to us the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which were all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Himself, that they are but vain;  and now, after <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> answer, giving them, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, all the more reasonable and fitting a reply, <q>My kingdom is not of this world.</q> But had He made an immediate answer to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> question, His reply would have appeared to refer to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> only, without including the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as entertaining such an opinion regarding Him. But now when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> replied, <q>Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, have delivered you to me;</q> he removed from himself the suspicion of being possibly supposed to have spoken of his own accord, in saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by showing that such a statement had been communicated to him by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And then by saying, <q>What have you done?</q> he made it sufficiently clear that this was charged against Him as a crime: as if he had said, If you deny such kingly claims, what have you done to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> your being delivered unto me? As if there would be no ground for wonder that one should be delivered up to a judge for punishment, who proclaimed himself a king; but if no such assertion were made, it became needful to inquire of Him, what else, if anything, He had done, that He should thus deserve to be delivered unto the judge.</p>

<p>2. Hear then, you <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; hear, O <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; hear, O uncircumcision; hear, all you kingdoms of the earth: I interfere not with your government in this world, <q>My kingdom is not of this world.</q> Cherish ye not the utterly vain terror that threw <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the elder into consternation when the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was announced, and led him to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of so many infants in the hope of including Christ in the fatal number,  made more cruel by his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> than by his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: <q>My kingdom,</q> He said, <q>is not of this world.</q> What would you more? Come to the kingdom that is not of this world; come, believing, and fall not into the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. He says, indeed, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Yet have I been appointed king by Him upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill of Zion;</q>  but that hill of Zion is not of this world. For what is His kingdom, save those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, to whom He says, <q>You are not of the world, even as I am not of the world</q>? And yet He wished them to be in the world: on that very account saying of them to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Hence also He says not here, <q>My kingdom is not</q> in this world; but, <q>is not of this world.</q> And when He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this by saying, <q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> He says not, <q>But now is my kingdom not</q> here, but, <q>is not from hence.</q> For His kingdom is here until the end of the world, having tares intermingled therewith until the harvest; for the harvest is the end of the world, when the reapers, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, shall come and gather out of His kingdom everything that offends; <span class="stiki" id="note171842"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;13:38-41</a></span> which certainly would not be done, were it not that His kingdom is here. But still it is not from hence; for it only sojourns as a stranger in the world: because He says to His kingdom, <q>You are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.</q>  They were therefore of the world, so long as they were not His kingdom, but belonged to the prince of this world. Of the world therefore are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, created indeed by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but generated from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as a vitiated and condemned stock; and there are made into a kingdom no longer of the world, all from thence that have been regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For so did God rescue us from the power of darkness, and translate us into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note171844"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> and of this kingdom it is that He says, <q>My kingdom is not of this world;</q> or, <q>My kingdom is not from hence.</q></p>

<p>3. <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore said unto Him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king.</q> Not that He was afraid to confess Himself a king, but <q>You say</q> has been so balanced that He neither denies Himself to be a king (for He is a king whose kingdom is not of this world), nor does He confess that He is such a king as to warrant the supposition that His kingdom is of this world. For as this was the very idea in <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> mind when he said, <q>Are you a king then?</q> so the answer he got was, <q>You say that I am a king.</q> For it was said, <q>You say,</q> as if it had been said, Carnal yourself, you say it carnally.</p>

<p>4. Thereafter He adds, <q>To this end was I born, and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> came I into the world, that I should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>**  Whence it is evident that He here referred to His own temporal nativity, when by becoming incarnate He came into the world, and not to that which had no beginning, whereby He was God through whom the Father created the world. For this, then, that is, on this account, He declared that He was born, and to this end He came into the world, to wit, by being born of the Virgin, that He might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note171846"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> He still further said, <q>Every one that is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hears my voice.</q> He hears, that is to say, with the ears of the inward man, or, in other words, He obeys my voice, which is equivalent to saying, He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> me. When Christ, therefore, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, of course, unto Himself; for from His own lips are the words, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q>  as He said also in another place, <q>I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself.</q>  But when He said, <q>Every one that is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hears my voice,</q> He commends the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby He calls according to His own purpose. Of which purpose the apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to those who are called according to the purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171849"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> to wit, the purpose of Him that calls, not of those who are called; which is put still more clearly in another place in this way, <q>Labor together in the gospel according to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who saves us and calls us with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171850"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8-9</a></span> For if our thoughts turn to the nature wherein we have been created, inasmuch as we were all created by the Truth, who is there that is not of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? But it is not all to whom it is given of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to hear, that is, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while in no case certainly is there any preceding of merit, lest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should cease to be <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For had He said, Every one that hears my voice is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then it would be supposed that he was declared to be of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> because he conforms to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; it is not this, however, that He says, but, <q>Every one that is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hears my voice.</q> And in this way he is not of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> simply because he hears His voice; but only on this account he hears, because he is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that is, because this is a gift bestowed on him of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And what else is this, but that by Christ's gracious bestowal he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Christ?</p>

<p>5. <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said unto Him, What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> Nor did he wait to hear the answer; but <q>when he had said this, he went out again unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said unto them, I find in him no fault. But you have a custom that I should release unto you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release unto you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said, <q>What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> there immediately occurred to his mind the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, according to which he was wont to release unto them one at the passover; and therefore he did not wait to hear Jesus' answer to his question, What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? To avoid delay on recollecting the custom whereby He might be released unto them during the passover&mdash; a thing which it is clear he greatly desired. It could not, however, be torn from his heart that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but was fixed there, as in the superscription, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, whereof he had just inquired what it was. <q>But on hearing this, they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</q> We blame you not, O <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for liberating the guilty during the passover, but for slaying the innocent; and yet unless that were done, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> passover would not take place. But a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was retained by the erring <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and by a marvellous dispensation of divine wisdom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that same shadow was fulfilled by deluded men; because in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> passover might be kept, Christ was led as a sheep to the sacrificial slaughter. Hence there follows the account of the injurious treatment received by Christ at the hands of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and his cohort; but this must be taken up in another discourse.</p>
