<h1>Tractate 117 (John 19:17-22)</h1>

<p>1. On <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> judgment and condemnation before the tribunal, they took the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, about the sixth hour, and led Him away. <q>And He, bearing His cross, went forth into the place that is called Calvary, but in Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified Him.</q> What else, then, is the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Mark saying, <q>And it was the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, and they crucified Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171863"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse25">Mark&nbsp;15:25</a></span> but this, that the Lord was crucified at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> by the tongues of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, at the sixth hour by the hands of the soldiers? That we may understand that the fifth hour was now completed, and there was some beginning made of the sixth, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> took his seat before the tribunal, which is expressed by John as <q>about  the sixth hour;</q> and when He was led forth, and nailed to the tree with the two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and the events recorded were enacted beside His cross, the completion of the sixth hour was fully reached, being the hour from which, on to the ninth, the sun was obscured, and the darkness took place, we have it jointly attested on the authority of the three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.  But as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> attempted to transfer the crime of slaying Christ from themselves to the Romans, that is to say, to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and his soldiers, therefore Mark suppresses the hour at which Christ was crucified by the soldiers, and which then began to enter upon the sixth, and remembers rather to give an express place to the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, at which they are understood to have cried out before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, <q>Crucify, crucify him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse6">John 19:6</a></span>, that it not only may be seen that the former crucified Jesus, namely, the soldiers who hung Him on the tree at the sixth hour, but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also, who at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> cried out to have Him crucified.</p>

<p>2. There is also another solution of this question, that we should not here understand the sixth hour of the day, because John says not, And it was about the sixth hour of the day, or about the sixth hour, but says, <q>And it was the <em> parasceve</em> of the passover, about the sixth hour</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse14">John 19:14</a></span>. And <em>parasceve</em> is in Latin <em>pr&aelig;paratio</em> (preparation); but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are fonder of using the Greek words in observances of this sort, even those of them who speak Latin rather than Greek. It was therefore the preparation of the passover. But <q>our passover, Christ,</q> as the apostle says, <q>has been <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171866"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and if we reckon the preparation of this passover from the ninth hour of the night (for then the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> seem to have given their verdict for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the Lord, when they said, <q>He is guilty of death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171867"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse66">Matthew&nbsp;26:66</a></span> and when the hearing of His case was still proceeding in the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> house: whence there is a kind of harmony in understanding that therewith began the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> passover, whose shadow was the passover of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> gave their sentence that He was to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>), certainly from that hour of the night, which is conjectured to have been then the ninth, on to the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day, when the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Mark testifies that Christ was crucified, there are six hours, three of the night, and three of the day. Hence in the case of this <em>parasceve</em> of the passover, that is, the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which began with the ninth hour of the night, it was about the sixth hour; that is to say, the fifth hour was completed, and the sixth had already begun to run, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ascended the tribunal: for that same preparation, which had begun with the ninth hour of the night, still continued till the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was the event in course of preparation, was completed, which took place at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, according to Mark, not of the preparation, but of the day; while it was also the sixth hour, not of the day, but of the preparation, by reckoning, of course, six hours from the ninth hour of the night to the third of the day. Of these two solutions of this difficult question let each choose the one that pleases him. But one will judge better what to choose who reads the very elaborate discussions on <q>The Harmony of the Evangelists.</q>  And if other solutions of it can also be found, the stability of gospel <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will have a more cumulative defense against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of unbelieving and profane vanity. And now, after these brief discussions, let us return to the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John.</p>

<p>3. <q>And they took Jesus,</q> he says, <q>and led Him away; and He, bearing His cross, went forth unto the place that is called Calvary, in the Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified Him.</q> Jesus, therefore, went to the place where He was to be crucified, bearing His cross. A grand spectacle! But if it be impiety that is the onlooker, a grand laughing-stock; if <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, a grand <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: if impiety be the onlooker, a grand demonstration of ignominy; if <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, a grand bulwark of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: if it is impiety that looks on, it laughs at the King bearing, in place of His kingly rod, the tree of His punishment; if it is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, it sees the King bearing the tree for His own crucifixion, which He was yet to affix even on the foreheads of kings, exposed to the contemptuous glances of the impious in connection with that wherein the hearts of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were thereafter to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was yet to say, <q>But God forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171869"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> He was commending that same cross of His by carrying it on His own shoulders, and bearing the candelabrum of that light that was yet to burn, and not to be placed under a bushel. <span class="stiki" id="note171870"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;5:15</a></span> <q>Bearing,</q> therefore, <q>His cross, He went forth into the place that is called Calvary, in the Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified Him, and two others with Him on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</q> These two, as we have learned in the narrative of the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, were thieves with whom He was crucified, and between whom He was fixed,  whereof the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> sent before had declared, <q>And He was numbered among the transgressors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171872"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> </p>

<p>4. <q>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wrote a title also, and put it on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and the writing was, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This title then read many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> For these three languages were conspicuous in that place beyond all others: the Hebrew on account of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who gloried in the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the Greek, because of the wise men among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and the Latin, on account of the Romans, who at that very time were exercising sovereign power over many and almost all countries.</p>

<p>5. <q>Then said the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> unto <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, Write not, The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but that he said, I am King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered, What I have written I have written.</q> Oh the ineffable power of the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>! Was there not some hidden voice that sounded through <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> inner man with a kind, if one may so say, of loud-toned silence, the words that had been prophesied so long before in the very letter of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Corrupt not the inscription of the title</q>?  Here, then, you see, he corrupted it not; what he has written he has written. But the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, who wished it to be corrupted, what did they say? <q>Write not, The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but that he said, I am King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> What is it, madmen, that you say? Why do you oppose the doing of that which you are utterly unable to alter? Will it by any such means become the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said, <q>I am King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></q>? If that cannot be tampered with which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> has written, can that be tampered with which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has uttered? But is Christ king only of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also? Yes, of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also. For when He said in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>I am set king by Him upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill of Zion, declaring the decree of the Lord,</q> that no one might say, because of the hill of Zion, that He was set king over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone, He immediately added, <q>The Lord said unto me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten You. Ask of me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.</q>  Whence He Himself, speaking now with His own lips among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, said, <q>Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one flock and one Shepherd.</q>  Why then would we have some great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  to be understood in this superscription, wherein it was written, <q>King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> if Christ is king also of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? For this reason, because it was the wild olive tree that was made partaker of the fatness of the olive tree, and not the olive tree that was made partaker of the bitterness of the wild olive tree. <span class="stiki" id="note171877"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;11:17</a></span> For inasmuch as the title, <q>King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> written regarding Christ, who are they that are to be understood as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> but the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the children of the promise, who are also the children of God? For <q>they,</q> says the apostle, <q>who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171878"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;9:7-8</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were those to whom he said, <q>But if you be Christ's, then are you <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed, and heirs according to the promise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171879"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse29">Galatians&nbsp;3:29</a></span> Christ therefore is king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but of those who are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note171880"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> who belong to the Jerusalem that is free, our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> mother in heaven, the spiritual Sarah, who casts out the bond maid and her children from the house of liberty. <span class="stiki" id="note171881"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;4:22-31</a></span> And therefore what <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wrote he wrote, because what the Lord said He said.</p>
