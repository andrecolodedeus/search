<h1>Tractate 11 (John 2:23-3:5)</h1>

<p>1. Opportunely has the Lord procured for us that this passage should occur in its order to day: for I suppose you have observed, beloved, that we have undertaken to consider and explain the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John in due course. Opportunely then it occurs, that today you should hear from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that, <q>Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he shall not see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> For it is time that we exhort you, who are still <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in such wise, that you are still bearing your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And none shall see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> while burdened with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for none shall reign with Christ, but he to whom they have been forgiven: but forgiven they cannot be, but to him who is born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But let us observe all the words what they imply, that here the sluggish may find with what earnestness they must haste to put off their burden. For were they bearing some heavy load, either of stone, or of wood, or even of some gain; if they were carrying grain, or wine, or money, they would run to put off their loads: they are carrying a burden of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and yet are sluggish to run. You must run to put off this burden; it weighs you down, it drowns you.</p>

<p>2. Behold, you have heard that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> <q>was in Jerusalem at the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, on the feast day, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, seeing the signs which He did.</q> <q>Many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name;</q> and what follows? <q>But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.</q> Now what does this mean, <q>They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> or trusted, <q>in His name;</q> and yet <q>Jesus did not trust Himself to them;</q>? Was it, perhaps, that they had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but were feigning to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and that therefore Jesus did not trust Himself to them? But the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> would not have said, <q>Many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name,</q> if he were not giving a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> testimony to them. A great thing, then, it is, and a wonderful thing: men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, and Christ trusts not Himself to men. Especially is it wonderful, since, being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He of course suffered willingly. If He were not willing, He would never have suffered, since, had He not willed it, He had not been born; and if He had willed this only, merely to be born and not to die, He might have done even whatever He willed, because He is the almighty Son of the almighty Father. Let us prove it by facts. For when they wished to hold Him, He departed from them. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says, <q>And when they would have cast Him headlong from the top of the mountain, He departed from them unhurt.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170258"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;4:30</a></span> And when they came to lay hold of Him, after He was sold by Judas the traitor, who imagined that he had it in his power to deliver up his Master and Lord, there also the Lord showed that He suffered of His own will, not of necessity. For when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> desired to lay hold of Him, He said to them, <q>Whom do you seek? But they said, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. And said He, I am He. On hearing this saying, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170259"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;18:4-6</a></span> In this, that in answering them He threw them to the ground, He showed His power; that in His being taken by them He might show His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. It was of compassion, then, that He suffered. For <q>He was delivered up for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and rose again for our justification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170260"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> Hear His own words: <q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again: no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself, that I may take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170261"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> Since, therefore, He had such power, since He declared it by words, showed it by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, what then does it mean that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not trust Himself to them, as if they would do Him some harm against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or would do something to Him against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, especially seeing that they had already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name? Moreover, of the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, <q>They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name,</q> of whom he says, <q>But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.</q> Why? <q>Because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and needed not that any should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of man: for Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man.</q> The artificer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in His own work better than the work <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in itself. The Creator of man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man, which the created man himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. Do we not prove this of Peter, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what was in himself, when he said, <q>With You, even to death</q>? Hear that the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man: <q>Thou with me even to death? Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.</q>  The man, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what was in himself; but the Creator of the man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in the man. Nevertheless, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them. What can we say, brethren? Perhaps the circumstances that follow will indicate to us what the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of these words is. That men had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him is manifest, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; none doubts it, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says it, the truth-speaking <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> testifies to it. Again, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> trusted not Himself to them is also manifest, and no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doubts it; for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says this also, and the same truth-speaking <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> testifies to it. Why, then, is it that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them? Let us see what follows.</p>

<p>3. <q>And there was a man of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> by name, a ruler of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: the same came to Him by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi (you already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Master is called Rabbi), we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are a teacher come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for no man can do these signs which You do, except God be with him.</q> This <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, then, was of those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, as they saw the signs and prodigies which He did. For this is what he said above: <q>Now, when He was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast-day, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name.</q> Why did they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? He goes on to say, <q>Seeing His signs which He did.</q> And what says he of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>? <q>There was a ruler of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> by name the same came to Him by night, and says to Him, Rabbi, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are a teacher come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Therefore this man also had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name. And why had he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? He goes on, <q>For no man can do these signs which You do, unless God be with him.</q> If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> was of those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, let us now consider, in the case of this <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, why Jesus did not trust Himself to them. <q>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> Therefore to them who have been born again does Jesus trust Himself. Behold, those men had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, and yet Jesus trusted not Himself to them. Such are all <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>: already they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but Jesus does not trust Himself to them. Give good heed, my beloved, and understand. If we say to a catechumen, Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, he answers, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and signs himself; already he bears the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on his forehead, and is not ashamed of the cross of his Lord. Behold, he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name. Let us ask him, Do you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and drink the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>? He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what we say, because Jesus has not trusted Himself to him.</p>

<p>4. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> was of that number, he came to the Lord, but came by night; and this perhaps pertains to the matter. Came to the Lord, and came by night; came to the Light, and came in the darkness. But what do they that are born again of water and of the Spirit hear from the apostle? <q>You were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170263"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and again, <q>But we who are of the day, let us be sober.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170264"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Therefore they who are born again were of the night, and are of the day; were darkness, and are light. Now Jesus trusts Himself to them, and they come to Jesus, not by night, like <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>; not in darkness do they seek the day. For such now also profess: Jesus has come near to them, has made <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in them; for He said, <q>Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he shall not have life in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170265"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;6:54</a></span> And as the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> have the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on their forehead, they are already of the great house; but from servants let them become sons. For they are something who already belong to the great house. But when did the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> eat the manna? After they had passed the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. And as to what the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> signifies, hear the apostle: <q>Moreover, brethren, I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.</q> To what purpose passed they through the sea? As if you were asking of him, he goes on to say, <q>And all were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the cloud and in the sea.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170266"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1</a></span> Now, if the figure of the sea had such efficacy, how great will be the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>! If what was done in a figure brought the people, after they had crossed over, to the manna, what will Christ impart, in the verity of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, to His own people, brought over through Himself? By His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> He brings over them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the enemies as it were that pursue them, being slain, as all the Egyptians perished in that sea. Whither does He bring over, my brethren? Whither does Jesus bring over by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> then showed the figure, when he brought them through the sea? Whither? To the manna. What is the manna? <q>I am,</q> says He, <q>the living bread, which came down from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170267"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> The faithful receive the manna, having now been brought through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>? Why <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>? Besides sea, why also <q>red</q>? That <q><a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a></q> signified the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ red, but as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Christ's blood? Whither, then, does He lead those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? To the manna. Behold, <q>manna,</q> I say: what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, received, is well known, well known what God had rained on them from heaven; and yet <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> receive. Let them blush, then, for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; let them pass through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, let them eat the manna, that as they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, so likewise Jesus may trust Himself to them.</p>

<p>5. Therefore mark, my brethren, what answer this man who came to Jesus by night makes. Although he came to Jesus, yet because he came by night, he still speaks from the darkness of his own flesh. He understands not what he hears from the Lord, understands not what he hears from the Light, <q>which lights every man that comes into this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170268"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> Already has the Lord said to him, <q>Unless a man be born again, he shall not see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says unto Him, How can a man be born again when he is old?</q> The Spirit speaks to him, and he thinks of the flesh. He thinks of his own flesh, because as yet he thinks not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh. For when the Lord Jesus had said, <q>Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he shall not have life in him,</q> some who followed Him were offended, and said among themselves, <q>This is a hard saying; who can hear it?</q> For they fancied that, in saying this, Jesus meant that they would be able to cook Him, after being cut up like a lamb, and eat Him: horrified at His words, they went back, and no more followed Him. Thus speaks the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>: <q>And the Lord Himself remained with the twelve; and they said to Him, Lo, those have left You. And He said, Will ye also go away?</q>&mdash; wishing to show them that He was necessary to them, not they necessary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let no man fancy that he frightens Christ, when he tells Him that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; as if Christ will be more blessed if you be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. It is a good thing for you to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; but if you be not, it will not be ill for Christ. Hear the voice of the psalm, <q>I said to the Lord, You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since You have no need of my goods.</q>  For that reason, <q>You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since of my goods You have no need.</q> If you be without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you will be less; if you be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God will not be greater. Not from you will He be greater, but you without Him will be less. Grow, therefore, in Him; do not withdraw yourself, that He may, as it were, diminish. You will be renewed if you come to Him, wilt suffer loss if you depart from Him. He remains entire when you come to Him, remains entire even when you fall away. When, therefore, He had said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Will ye also go away?</q> Peter, that Rock, answered with the voice of all, <q>Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> Pleasantly savored the Lord's flesh in his mouth. The Lord, however, expounded to them, and said, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens.</q> After He had said, <q>Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he shall not have life in him,</q> lest they should understand it carnally, He said, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens, but the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170270"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;6:54-59</a></span> </p>

<p>6. This <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, who had come to Jesus by night, did not savor of this spirit and this life. Says Jesus to him, <q>Unless a man be born again, he shall not see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> And he, savoring of his own flesh, while as yet he savored not of the flesh of Christ in his mouth, says, <q>How can a man be born a second time, when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</q> This man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> but one birth, that from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>; that which is from God and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not yet: he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> only those <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that bring forth to death, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not yet the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that bring forth to life; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that bring forth successors, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not yet the ever-living <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that bring forth those that shall abide.</p>

<p>Whilst there are two births, then, he understood only one. One is of the earth, the other of heaven; one of the flesh, the other of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; one of mortality, the other of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; one of male and female, the other of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But these two are each single; there can be no repeating the one or the other. Rightly did <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> understand the birth of the flesh; so understand also the birth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> understood the birth of the flesh. What did <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> understand? <q>Can a man enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</q> Thus, whosoever shall tell you to be spiritually born a second time, answer in the words of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, <q>Can a man enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</q> I am already born of Adam, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> cannot beget me a second time. I am already born of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Christ cannot beget me again. As there is no repeating from the womb, so neither from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>7. He that is born of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is born, as it were, of Sarah, of the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; he that is born of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is, as it were, born of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed. Consider, beloved, how great a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. God testifies, saying, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> Were there not other patriarchs? Before these, was there not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, who alone of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, with all his house, was worthy to be delivered from the flood,&mdash; he in whom, and in his sons, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was prefigured? Borne by wood, they escaped the flood. Then afterwards great men whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, whom <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> commends, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> faithful in all his house. <span class="stiki" id="note170271"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse7">Numbers&nbsp;12:7</a></span> And yet those three are named, just as if they alone deserved well of him: <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob: this is my name for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170272"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6,&nbsp;15</a></span> Sublime <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! It is the Lord that is able to open both our mouth and your hearts, that we may speak as He has deigned to reveal, and that you may receive even as it is expedient for you.</p>

<p>8. The patriarchs, then, are these three, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the sons of Jacob were twelve, and thence the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for Jacob himself is <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in twelve tribes pertaining to the twelve sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob three fathers, and one people. The fathers three, as it were in the beginning of the people; three fathers in whom the people was figured: and the former people itself the present people. For in the Jewish people was figured the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. There a figure, here the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; there a shadow, here the body: as the apostle says, <q>Now these things happened to them in a figure.</q> It is the apostle's voice: <q>They were written,</q> says he, <q>for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages has come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170273"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> Let your mind now recur to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob. In the case of these three, we find that free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bear children, and that bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bear children: we find there offspring of free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, we find there also offspring of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> signifies nothing good: <q>Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> says he, <q>and her son; for the son of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be heir with the son of the free.</q> The apostle recounts this; and he says that in those two sons of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was a figure of the two Testaments, the Old and the New. To the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> belong the lovers of temporal things, the lovers of the world: to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> belong the lovers of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Hence, that Jerusalem on earth was the shadow of the heavenly Jerusalem, the mother of us all, which is in heaven; and these are the apostle's words.  And of that city from which we are absent on our sojourn, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> much, you have now heard much. But we find a wonderful thing in these births, in these fruits of the womb, in these generations of free and bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: namely, four sorts of men; in which four sorts is completed the figure of the future <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, so that what was said in the case of those three patriarchs is not surprising, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> For in the case of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, observe, brethren, either good men are born of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men of good; or good men of good, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: more than these four sorts you cannot find. These things I will again repeat: Give heed, keep them, excite your hearts, be not dull; take in, lest ye be taken, how of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> there are four sorts. Either of the good are born good, or of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are born <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or of the good are born <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good. I think it is plain. Of the good, good; if they who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> are good, and also they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and are rightly numbered among the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; if they who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> approach God with a double heart, and do not observe the morals which they hear urged in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so as not to be chaff, but grain, there. How many such there are, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, beloved. Of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, good; sometimes an adulterer baptizes, and he that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is justified. Of the good, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; sometimes they who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> do not desire to keep the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>9. I suppose, brethren, that this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that what we are saying is manifest by daily examples; but let us consider these things in the case of our fathers before us, how they also had these four kinds. Of the good, good; Ananias <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. How of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? The apostle declares that there were certain preachers of the gospel, who, he says, did not use to preach the gospel with a pure motive, whom, however, he tolerates in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> society, saying, <q>What then, notwithstanding every way, whether by occasion or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Christ is preached, and in this I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170275"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> Was he therefore malevolent, and did he <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? No, but rejoiced because through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was preached, and by the mouths of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men Christ was preached. If these men <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> like themselves, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men: if they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> such as the Lord admonishes, when He says, <q>Whatsoever they bid you, do; but do not ye after their works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170276"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men that were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> good. Good men <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, as Simon the sorcerer was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man. <span class="stiki" id="note170277"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;8:13</a></span> Therefore these four sorts, my brethren, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. See, I repeat them again, hold them, count them, think upon them; guard against what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; keep what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Good men are born of good, when <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men are born of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when both they that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and they that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> live unrighteously and ungodly; good men are born of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, and they good that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men are born of good, when they are good that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, and they <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>10. How do we find this in these three names, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob</q>? We hold the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among the good. Free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bear the good; Sarah bare Isaac: bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; Hagar bare Ishmael. We have in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> alone the two sorts, both when the good are of the good, and also when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But where have we <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of good figured? Rebecca, Isaac's wife, was a free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: read, She bare twins; one was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. You have the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> openly declaring by the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Jacob have I loved, but <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> have I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>.</q>  Rebecca bare those two, Jacob and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>: one of them is chosen, the other is reprobated; one succeeds to the inheritance, the other is disinherited. God does not make His people of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, but makes it of Jacob. The seed is one, those conceived are dissimilar: the womb is one, those born of it are diverse. Was not the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that bare Jacob, the same free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that bare <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>? They strove in the mother's womb; and when they strove there, it was said to Rebecca, <q>Two peoples are in your womb.</q> Two men, two peoples; a good people, and a bad people: but yet they strive in one womb. How many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men there are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! And one womb carries them until they are separated in the end: and the good cry out against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in turn cry out against the good, and both strive together in the bowels of one mother. Will they be always together? There is a going forth to the light in the end; the birth which is here figured in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is declared; and it will then appear that <q>Jacob have I loved, but <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> have I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>.</q></p>

<p>11. Accordingly we have now found, brethren, of the good, good&mdash; of the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Isaac; and of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Ishmael; and of the good, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; of Rebecca, <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>: where shall we find of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, good? There remains Jacob, that the completion of these four sorts may be concluded in the three patriarchs. Jacob had for wives free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, he had also bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: the free bear children, as do also the bond, and thus come the twelve sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. If you count them all, of whom they were born, they were not all of the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor all of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but yet they were all of one seed. What, then, my brethren? Did not they who were born of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> possess the land of promise together with their brethren? We have there found good sons of Jacob born of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and good sons of Jacob born of free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Their birth of the wombs of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was nothing against them, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their seed in the father, and consequently they held the kingdom with their brethren. Therefore, as in the case of Jacob's sons, that they were born of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> did not hinder their holding the kingdom, and receiving the land of promise on an equality with their brothers; their birth of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> did not hinder them, but the father's seed prevailed: so, whoever are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, appear as if born of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; nevertheless, because they are of the seed of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, which is figured in Jacob, let them not be cast down, they shall possess the inheritance with their brethren. Therefore, let him who is born of the good seed be without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; only let him not imitate the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if he is born of a bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Do not imitate the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For how came the sons of Jacob, that were born of bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, to possess the land of promise with their brethren, while Ishmael, born of a bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was cast out from the inheritance? How, but because he was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>? He proudly reared his neck, and wished to seduce his brother while he was playing with him.</p>

<p>12. A great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is there. They were playing together, Ishmael and Isaac: Sarah sees them playing, and says to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her son; for the son of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</q> And when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was sorrowful, the Lord confirmed to him the saying of his wife. Now here is evidently a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that the event was somehow pregnant with something future. She sees them playing, and says, <q>Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her son.</q> What is this, brethren? For what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had Ishmael done to the boy Isaac, in playing with him? That playing was a mocking; that playing signified deception. Now attend, beloved, to this great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. The apostle calls it <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; that playing, that play, he calls <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>: for he says, <q>But as then he that was born after the flesh, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him that was born after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so also now;</q> that is, they that are born after the flesh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them that are born after the Spirit. Who are born after the flesh? Lovers of the world, lovers of this life. Who are born after the Spirit? Lovers of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, lovers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, men that long for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that worship God freely. They play, and the apostle calls it <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. For after he said these words, <q>And as then he that was born after the flesh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him that was born after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so also now;</q> the apostle went on, and showed of what <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he was speaking: <q>But what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her son: for the son of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</q>  We search where the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says this, to see whether any <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on Ishmael's part against Isaac preceded this; and we find that this was said by Sarah when she saw the boys playing together. The playing which <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that Sarah saw, the apostle calls <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Hence, they who seduce you by playing, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you the more. <q>Come,</q> say they, <q>Come, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> here, here is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for you.</q> Do not play, there is one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; that other is play: you will be seduced, and that will be a grievous <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to you. It were better for you to make Ishmael a present of the kingdom; but Ishmael will not have it, for he means to play. Keep your father's inheritance, and hear this: <q>Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her son; for the son of the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</q></p>

<p>13. These men, too, dare to say that they are wont to suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from catholic kings, or from catholic princes. What <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> do they bear? Affliction of body: yet if at times they have suffered, and how they suffered, let themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and settle it with their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>; still they suffered only affliction of body: the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more grievous. Beware when Ishmael wishes to play with Isaac, when he fawns on you, when he offers another <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: answer him, I have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> already. For if this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, he who would give you another would be mocking you. Beware of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For though the party of Donatus has at times suffered somewhat at the hands of catholic princes, it was a bodily suffering, not the suffering of spiritual deception. Hear and see in the very facts of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> history all the signs and indications of things to come. Sarah is found to have afflicted her maid Hagar: Sarah is free. After her maid began to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, Sarah complained to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said, <q>Cast out the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>;</q> she has lifted her neck against me. His wife complains of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, as if it were his doing. But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was not bound to the maid by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but by the duty of begetting children, inasmuch as Sarah had given her to him to have offspring by her, says to her: <q>Behold, she is your handmaid; do unto her as you will.</q> And Sarah grievously afflicted her, and she fled from her face. See, the free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> afflicted the bond <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and the apostle does not call that a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; the slave plays with his master, and he calls it <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>: this afflicting is not called <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; that playing is. How does it appear to you, brethren? Do you not understand what is signified? Thus, then, when God wills to stir up powers against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, against schismatics, against those that scatter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that blow on Christ as if they abhorred Him, that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, let them not wonder; because God stirs them up, that Hagar may be beaten by Sarah. Let Hagar <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> herself, and yield her neck: for when, after being humiliated, she departed from her mistress, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> met her, and said to her, <q>What is the matter with you, Hagar, Sarah's handmaid?</q> When she complained of her mistress, what did she hear from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? <q>Return to your mistress.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170280"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;16:9</a></span> It is for this that she is afflicted, that she may return; and would that she may return, for her offspring, just like the sons of Jacob, will obtain the inheritance with their brethren.</p>

<p>14. But they wonder that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> powers are roused against detestable scatterers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Should they not be moved, then? How otherwise should they give an account of their rule to God? Observe, beloved, what I say, that it concerns <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kings of this world to wish their mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which they have been spiritually born, to have peace in their times. We read Daniel's visions and prophetical histories. The three children praised the Lord in the fire: King <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> wondered at the children praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the fire around them doing them no harm: and while he wondered, what did King <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> say, he who was neither a Jew nor <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, who had set up his own image and compelled all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to adore it; but, impressed by the praises of the three children when he saw the majesty of God present in the fire what said he? <q>And I will publish a decree to all tribes and tongues in the whole earth.</q> What sort of decree? <q>Whosoever shall speak <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut off, and their houses shall be made a ruin.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170281"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel&nbsp;iii</a></span> See how an alien king acts with raging indignation that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> might not be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, because He was able to deliver the three children from the fire: and yet they would not have <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kings to act with severity when Christ is contemptuously rejected, by whom not three children, but the whole world, with these very kings, is delivered from the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>! For those three children, my brethren, were delivered from temporal fire. Is He not the same God who was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Maccabees and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the three children? The latter He delivered from the fire; the former did in body perish in the torments of fire, but in mind they remained steadfast in the ordinances of the law. The latter were openly delivered, the former were crowned in secret. <span class="stiki" id="note170282"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;vii</a></span> It is a greater thing to be delivered from the flame of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> than from the furnace of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. If, then, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> praised and extolled and gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to God because He delivered three children from the fire, and gave such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as to send forth a decree throughout his kingdom, <q>Whosoever shall speak <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut off, and their houses shall be brought to ruin,</q> how should not these kings be moved, who observe, not three children delivered from the flame, but their very selves delivered from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, when they see Christ, by whom they have been delivered, contemptuously spurned in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, when they hear it said to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <q>Say that you are not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></q>? Men are willing to do such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but they do not wish to suffer, at all events, such punishments.</p>

<p>15. For see what they do and what they suffer. They slay <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they suffer in body: they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> everlasting deaths, and yet they complain that they themselves suffer temporal deaths. And yet what deaths do they suffer? They allege to us some <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of theirs in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. See, Marculus was hurled headlong from a rock; see, Donatus of Bagaia was thrown into a well. When have the Roman authorities decreed such punishments as casting men down rocks? But what do those of our party reply? What was done I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; what however do ours tell? That they flung themselves headlong and cast the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> of it upon the authorities. Let us call to mind the custom of the Roman authorities, and see to whom we are to give credit. Our men declare that those men cast themselves down headlong. If they are not the very <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of those men, who now cast themselves down precipices, while no man persecutes them, let us not credit the allegation of our men: what wonder if those men did what these are wont to do? The Roman authorities never did employ such punishments: for had they not the power to put them to death openly? But those men, while they wished to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> when dead, found not a death to make them more famous. In short, whatever the fact was, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And even if you have suffered corporal affliction, O party of Donatus, at the hand of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as an Hagar you have suf fered it at the hand of Sarah; <q>return to your mistress.</q> A point which it was indeed necessary to discuss has detained us somewhat too long to be at all able to expound the whole text of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> Lesson. Let this suffice you in the meantime, beloved brethren, lest, by speaking of other matters, what has been spoken might be shut out from your hearts. Hold fast these things, declare such things; and while yourselves are inflamed, go your way there, and set on fire them that are cold.</p>
