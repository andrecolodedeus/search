<h1>Tractate 124 (John 21:19-25)</h1>

<p>1. It is no unimportant question why the Lord, when He manifested Himself for the third time to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said unto the Apostle Peter, <q>Follow me;</q> but of the Apostle John, <q>Thus I wish him to remain  till I come, what is that to you?</q> To the discussion or solution of this question, according as the Lord shall grant us ability we devote the last discourse of this work. When the Lord, then, had announced beforehand to Peter by what death he was to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He says unto him, Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, sees the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that shall betray You? Peter, therefore, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this man? Jesus says unto him, Thus do I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> dies not: yet Jesus said not unto him, He dies not; but, Thus do I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you?</q> You see the great extent in this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of a question which, by its depth, must exercise in no ordinary way the mind of the inquirer. For why is it said to Peter, <q>Follow me,</q> and not to the others who were likewise present? Surely the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> followed Him also as their Master. But if it is to be understood only in reference to his suffering, was Peter the only one that suffered for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>? Was there not present there among those seven, another son of Zebedee, the brother of John, who, after His ascension, is plainly recorded to have been slain by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note171962"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;12:2</a></span> But some one may say that, as James was not crucified, it was properly enough said to Peter, <q>Follow me,</q> inasmuch as he underwent not only death, but, like Christ, even the death of the cross. Be it so, if no other explanation can be found that is more satisfactory. Why, then, was it said of John, <q>Thus do I wish him to remain till I come, what is that to you?</q> and the words repeated, <q>You follow me,</q> as if that other, therefore, were not to follow, seeing He wished him to remain till He comes. Who can readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that anything else was meant than what the brethren who lived at the time <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, namely, that that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> was not to die, but to abide in this life till Jesus came? But John himself removed such an idea, by giving a flat contradiction to the report that the Lord had said so. For why should he add, <q>Jesus says not, He dies not,</q> save to prevent what was false from taking hold of the hearts of men?</p>

<p>2. But let any one who so lists still refuse his assent, and declare that what John asserts is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> enough, that the Lord said not that that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> dies not, and yet that this is the meaning of such words as He is here recorded to have used; and further assert that the Apostle John is still living, and maintain that he is sleeping rather than lying dead in his tomb at Ephesus. Let him employ as an argument the current report that there the earth is in sensible commotion, and presents a kind of heaving appearance, and assert whether it be steadfastly or obstinately that this is occasioned by his breathing. For we cannot fail to have some who so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, if there is no want of those also who affirm that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is alive; because it is written that his sepulchre could not be found, <span class="stiki" id="note171963"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:6</a></span> and that he appeared with the Lord on the mountain along with Elias, <span class="stiki" id="note171964"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;17:3</a></span> of whom we read that he did not die, but was translated. <span class="stiki" id="note171965"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:11</a></span> As if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> body could not have been hid somewhere in such a way as that its position should altogether escape discovery by men, and be raised up therefrom by divine power at the time when Elias and he were seen with Christ just as at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> arose, and after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> appeared, according to Scripture, to many in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city. <span class="stiki" id="note171966"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52-53</a></span> But still, as I began to say, if some deny the death of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whom Scripture itself, in the very passage where we read that his sepulchre could nowhere be found, explicitly declares to have died; how much more may occasion be taken from these words where the Lord says, <q>Thus do I wish him to stay till I come,</q> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that John is sleeping, but still alive, beneath the ground? Of whom we have also the tradition (which is found in certain <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> scriptures), that he was present, in good health, when he ordered a sepulchre to be made for him; and that, when it was dug and prepared with all possible care, he laid himself down there as in a bed, and became immediately defunct: yet as those think who so understand these words of the Lord, not really defunct, but only lying like one in such a condition; and, while accounted dead, was actually buried when asleep, and that he will so remain till the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> meanwhile the fact of his life by the bubbling up of the dust, which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be forced by the breath of the sleeper to ascend from the depths to the surface of the grave. I think it quite superfluous to contend with such an opinion. For those may see for themselves who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the locality whether the ground there does or suffers what is said regarding it, because, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we too have heard of it from those who are not altogether unreliable witnesses.</p>

<p>3. Meanwhile let us yield to the opinion, which we are unable to refute by any certain evidence, lest we stir up still another question that may be put to us, Why the very ground should seem in a kind of way to live and breathe upon the interred corpse? But can so great a question as the one before us be settled on such grounds as these, if by a great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, such as can be wrought by the Almighty, the living body lies so long asleep beneath the ground, till the coming of the end of the world? Nay, rather, does there not arise a wider and more difficult one, why Jesus bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, whom He loved beyond the others to such an extent that he was counted worthy to recline on His breast, the gift of a protracted sleep in the body, when He delivered the blessed Peter, by the eminent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, from the burden of the body itself, and vouchsafed to him what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> said that he desired, and committed to writing, namely, <q>to be let loose, and to be with Christ</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note171967"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> But if, what is rather to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, Saint John declared that the Lord said not, <q>He dies not,</q> for the very purpose that no such meaning might be attached to the words which He used; and his body lies in its sepulchre lifeless like those of others deceased; it remains, if that really takes place which report has spread abroad regarding the soil, which grows up anew, though continually carried away, that it is either so done for the purpose of commending the preciousness of his death, seeing it wants the commendation of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (for he suffered not death at a persecutor's hand for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ), or on some other account that is concealed from our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Still there remains the question, why the Lord said of one who was destined to die, <q>Thus I wish him to remain till I come.</q></p>

<p>4. And who, besides, would not be disposed, in the case of these two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Peter and John, to make this further inquiry, why the Lord loved John better, when He Himself was better loved by Peter? For wherever John has something to say of himself, in order that the reference may be understood without any mention of his name, he adds this, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> loved him, as if he were the only one so loved, that he might be distinguished by this mark from the others, who were all of them certainly loved by Christ: and what else, when he so spoke, did he wish to be understood but that he himself was more abundantly loved? And far be it that he should utter a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. And what greater <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> could Jesus have given of His own greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to him than that this man, who was only a partner with the rest of his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, should be the only one that leaned on the breast of the Saviour Himself? And further, that the Apostle Peter loved Christ more than the others, may be adduced from many documentary evidences; but to go no further after others, it is plainly enough apparent in the lesson almost immediately preceding the present, in connection with that third manifestation of the Lord, when He put to him the question, <q>Do you love me more than these?</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it, of course, and yet asked, in order that we also, who read the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Peter's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both from the questions of the One and the answers of the other. But when Peter only replied, <q>I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You,</q> without adding, <q>more than these,</q> his answer contained all that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of himself. For he could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much He was loved by any other, not being able to look into that other's heart. But by saying in the earliest of his answers, <q>Yea, Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he stated in clear enough terms, that it was with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all that the Lord asked what He asked. The Lord therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, not only that Peter loved Him, but also that he loved Him more than the others. And yet if we propose to ourselves, in the way of inquiry, which of the two is the better, he that loves Christ more or he that loves Him less, who will hesitate to answer, he is the better that loves Him more? If, on the other hand, we propose this question, which of the two is the better, he that is loved less or he that is loved more by Christ, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we shall reply that he is the better who is loved the more by Christ. In the comparison therefore which I drew first, Peter is superior to John; but in the latter, John is preferred to Peter. Accordingly, we have a third to propose in this form: Which of the two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> is the better, he that loves Christ less than his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> [does], and is loved more than his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> by Christ? Or he who is loved less than his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> by Christ, while he, more than his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, loves Christ? Here it is that the answer plainly halts, and the question grows in magnitude. As far, however, as my own wisdom goes, I might easily reply, that he is the better who loves Christ the more, but he the happier who is loved the more by Christ; if only I could thoroughly see how to defend the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of our Deliverer in loving him the less by whom He is loved the more, and him the more by whom He is loved the less.</p>

<p>5. I shall therefore, in the manifested mercy of Him whose <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is hidden, set about the discussion, in order to the solution of a question of such importance, in accordance with the strength which He may graciously bestow: for hitherto it has only been proposed, not expounded. Let this, then, be the commencement of its exposition, namely, that we bear in mind that in this corruptible body, which burdens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note171968"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> we live a miserable life. But we who are now redeemed by the Mediator, and have received the earnest of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, have a blessed life in prospect, although we possess it not as yet in reality. But a hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. <span class="stiki" id="note171969"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> And it is in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that every one suffers, not in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that he enjoys, that he has need of patience. The present life, therefore, whereof it is written, <q>Is not the life of man a term of trial upon earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171970"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> in which we are daily crying to the Lord, <q>Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171971"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> a man is compelled to endure, even when his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven him, although it was the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that caused his falling into such misery. For the penalty is more protracted than the fault; lest the fault should be accounted small, were the penalty to end with itself. On this account it is also, either for the demonstration of our debt of misery, or for the amendment of our passing life, or for the exercise of the necessary patience, that man is kept through time in the penalty, even when he is no longer held by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as liable to everlasting damnation. This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> lamentable but unblameable condition of the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days we pass in this mortal state, even while in it we look with loving eyes to the days that are good. For it comes from the righteous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereof the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> say, <q>Man, that is born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, is of few days and full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171972"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;14:1</a></span> for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God is not like that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the disturbance of an excited man, but the calm fixing of righteous punishment. In this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of His, God restrains not, as it is written, His tender mercies;  but, besides other consolations to the miserable, which He ceases not to bestow on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, in the fullness of time, when He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son, <span class="stiki" id="note171974"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> by whom He created all things, that He might become man while remaining <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so be the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus: <span class="stiki" id="note171975"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, being absolved by the laver of regeneration from the guilt of all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;to wit, both of the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they have inherited by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted, and of all others contracted by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conduct&mdash;might be delivered from perpetual condemnation, and live in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> while sojourning in this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and perilous <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> on the one hand, but the consolations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both bodily and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the salutary remedies of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> whereby their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> might be aided when He taught them to say, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171976"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> So does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper personality, he was by nature one man, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> one <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, by still more abounding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to him, <q>I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and whatsoever you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,</q> he represented the universal Church, which in this world is shaken by various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, that come upon it like torrents of rain, floods and tempests, and falls not, because it is founded upon a rock (<em>petra</em>), from which Peter received his name. For <em> petra</em> (rock) is not derived from Peter, but Peter from <em> petra</em>; just as Christ is not called so from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, <q>On this rock will I build my Church,</q> because Peter had said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171977"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16-19</a></span> On this rock, therefore, He said, which you have confessed, I will build my Church. For the Rock (<em>Petra</em>) was Christ; <span class="stiki" id="note171978"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note171979"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, which is founded in Christ received from Him the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is essentially in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, such representatively is Peter in the rock (<em>petra</em>); and in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives amidst <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by loving and following Christ is delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But its following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But to the universality  [of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>] is it said, <q>Follow me,</q> even as it was for the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter says, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His footsteps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171981"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> This, then, you see is why it was said to him, <q>Follow me.</q> But there is another, an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life, that is not in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a riddle, <span class="stiki" id="note171982"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> even when much progress is made in the beholding of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to herself from heaven, that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereof the one is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the wages of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; one declines from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and makes for good, the other has no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory; the one is helped in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, the other, free from all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent, the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything to pardon nor does anything for which pardon has to be asked; the one is scourged with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that it may not be elated with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, the other is free from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by such a fullness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that, without any <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerns both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the other has only that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> presented to view: therefore the one is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed. This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter, <q>Follow me;</q> but of the former, <q>Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? You follow me.</q> For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes, so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, You follow me by imitating me in the endurance of temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; let him remain till I come to restore everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come. For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, follows Christ; but the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> tarries till Christ come, to be manifested then. For here the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this world are endured in the land of the dying, while there shall be seen the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the Lord in the land of the living. For in saying, <q>I wish him to tarry till I come,</q> we are not to understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait; seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but when Christ has come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, <q>You follow me,</q> unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in this life of activity, the more we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ the more easily are we delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But He loves us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it, that we may not be always such as we are. There, however, He loves us more; for we shall not have anything about us to displease Him, or anything that He will have to separate us from: nor is it for anything else that He loves us here but that He may heal and translate us from everything He loves not. Here, therefore, [He loves us] less, where He would not have us remain; there in larger measure, whither He would have us to be passing, and out of that wherein He would not that we should perish. Let Peter therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, that we may obtain deliverance from our present mortality; let John be loved by Him, that we may be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to come.</p>

<p>6. But by this line of argument we have shown why Christ loved John more than Peter, not why Peter loved Christ more than John. For if Christ loves us more in the world to come, where we shall live unendingly with Him, than in the present, from which we are in the course of being rescued, that we may be always in the other, it does not follow on that account that we shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him less when better ourselves; since we can in no possible way be better ourselves, save by loving Him more. Why was it, then, that John loved Him less than Peter, if he signified that life, wherein He must be more abundantly loved, but because on that very account it was said, <q>I will that he tarry,</q> that is wait, <q>till I come;</q> for we have not yet the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, which will then be greater far, but are expecting that future, that we may have it when He shall come? Just as in his own epistle the same apostle declares, <q>It has not yet appeared what we shall be: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171983"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Then accordingly shall we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the more that which we shall see. But the Lord Himself, in His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, loves more that future life of ours that is yet to come, such as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it will be hereafter in us, in order that by so loving us He may draw us onward to its possession. Wherefore, as all the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our present misery, because we feel it; and therefore we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more the mercy of the Lord, which we wish to be exhibited in our deliverance from misery, and we ask and experience it daily, especially in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: this it is that was signified by Peter, as loving more, but less beloved; because Christ loves us less in our misery than in our blessedness. But the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such as it then shall be, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> less, because as yet we neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor possess it: this was signified by John as loving less, and therefore waiting both for that state itself, and for the perfecting in us of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Him, to which He is entitled, till the Lord come; but loved the more, because that it is, which is symbolized by him, that makes him blessed.</p>

<p>7. Let no one, however, separate these distinguished <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. In that which was signified by Peter, they were both alike; and in that which was signified by John, they will both be alike hereafter. In their representative character, the one was following, the other tarrying; but in their personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they were both of them enduring the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the misery here, both of them expecting the future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the blessedness to come. And such is the case, not with them alone, but with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> universal Church, the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has still to be rescued from the present trials, and to be preserved in the future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And these two states of life were symbolized by Peter and John, the one by the one, the other by the other; but in this life they both of them walked for a time by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the other they shall both of them enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> by sight. For the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, therefore, inseparably belonging to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and for their safe pilotage through the present tempestuous life, did Peter, the first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, receive the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> for the binding and loosing of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and for the same congregation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in reference to the perfect repose in the bosom of that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> life to come did the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John recline on the breast of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is not the former alone but the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that binds and looses <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; nor did the latter alone drink at the fountain of the Lord's breast, to emit again in preaching, of the Word in the beginning, God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and those other sublime truths regarding the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Trinity and Unity of the whole Godhead. which are to be yet beheld in that kingdom face to face, but meanwhile till the Lord's coming are only to be seen in a mirror and in a riddle; but the Lord has Himself diffused this very gospel through the whole world, that every one of His own may drink thereat according to his own individual capacity. There are some who have entertained the idea&mdash; and those, too, who are no contemptible handlers of sacred eloquence&mdash; that the Apostle John was more loved by Christ on the ground that he never married a wife, and lived in perfect <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> from early boyhood.  There is, indeed, no distinct evidence of this in the canonical Scriptures: nevertheless it is an idea that contributes not a little to the suitableness of the opinion expressed above, namely, that that life was signified by him, where there will be no marriage.</p>

<p>8. <q>This is the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And there are also,</q> he adds, <q>many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.</q> We are not to suppose that in regard to local space the world would be unable to contain them; for how could they be written in it if it could not bear them when written? But perhaps it is that they could not be comprehended by the capacity of the readers: although, while our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in certain things themselves remains unharmed, the words we use about them may not unfrequently appear to exceed belief. This will not take place when anything that was obscure or dubious is in course of exposition by the setting forth of its ground and reason, but only when that which is clear of itself is either magnified or extenuated, without any real departure from the pathway of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be intimated; for the words may outrun the thing itself that is indicated only in such a way, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that speaks, but without any intention to deceive, may be apparent, so that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how far he will be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he, orally, either diminishes or magnifies his subject beyond the limit to which credit will be given. This mode of speaking is called by the Greek name hyperbole, by the masters not only of Greek, but also of Latin literature. And this mode is found not only here, but in several other parts also of the divine literature: as, <q>They set their mouths against the heavens;</q>  and, <q>The top of the hair of such as go on in their trespasses;</q>  and many others of the same kind, which are no more wanting in the sacred Scriptures than other tropes or modes of speaking. Of these I might give a more elaborate discussion, were it not that, as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> here terminates his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, I am also compelled to bring my discourse to a close.</p>
