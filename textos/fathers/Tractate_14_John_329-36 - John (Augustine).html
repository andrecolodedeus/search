<h1>Tractate 14 (John 3:29-36)</h1>

<p>1. This lesson from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shows us the excellency of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ's</a> divinity, and the humility of the man who earned the title of the Bridegroom's friend; that we may distinguish between the man who is man, and the Man who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Man who is God is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, God before all ages, Man in the age of our world: God of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, man of the Virgin, yet one and the same Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But John, a man of distinguished <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, was sent before Him, a man enlightened by Him who is the Light. For of John it is said, <q>He was not the Light, but that he should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Light.</q> He may himself be called a light indeed, and rightly so; but an enlightened, not an enlightening light. The light that enlightens, and that which is enlightened, are different things: for even our eyes are called lights (<em>lumina</em>), and yet when we open them in the dark, they do not see. But the light that enlightens is a light both from itself and for itself, and does not need another light for its shining; but all the rest need it, that they may shine.</p>

<p>2. Accordingly John confessed Him: as you have heard that when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was making many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and they reported to John as if to excite him to jealousy,&mdash; for they told the matter as if moved by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, <q>Lo, he is making more <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> than you,</q>&mdash; John confessed what he was, and thereby merited to belong to Him, because he dared not affirm himself to be that which Jesus is. Now this is what John said: <q>A man cannot receive anything, unless it be given him from heaven.</q> Therefore Christ gives, man receives. <q>You yourselves bear me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I said, I am not the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, but that I am sent before Him. He that has the bride is the Bridegroom; but the friend of the Bridegroom, who stands and hears Him, rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom's voice.</q> Not of himself did he give himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. He that will have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of himself shall be sad; but he that will have his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of God will ever <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because God is everlasting. Do you desire to have everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? Cleave to Him who is everlasting. Such an one John declared himself to be. <q>Because of the Bridegroom's voice, the friend of the Bridegroom rejoices,</q> not because of his own voice, and <q>stands and hears.</q> Therefore, if he falls, he hears Him not: for of a certain one who fell it is said, <q>And he stood not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170315"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> this is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. It behooves the Bridegroom's friend, then, <q>to stand and to hear.</q> What is it to stand? It is to abide in His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which he received. And he hears a voice at which he rejoices. Such was John: he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> whereof he rejoiced; he did not arrogate to himself to be what he was not; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself as one enlightened, not the enlightener. <q>But that was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, <q>that lightens every man coming into this world.</q> If <q>every man,</q> then also John himself; for he too is of men. Moreover, although none has arisen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> greater than John, yet he was himself one of those that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Is he to be compared with Him who, because He willed it, was born by a singular and extraordinary birth? For both generations of the Lord are unexampled, both the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>: by the divine He has no mother; by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, no father. Therefore John was but one of the rest: of greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, however, so that of those born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> none arose greater than he; so great a testimony he gave to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> as to call Him the Bridegroom, and himself the Bridegroom's friend, not worthy however to loose the latchet of the Bridegroom's shoe. You have already heard much on this point, beloved: let us look to what follows; for it is somewhat hard to understand. But as John himself says, that <q>no man can receive anything, unless it be given him from heaven,</q> whatever we shall not have understood, let us ask Him who gives from heaven: for we are men, and cannot receive anything, except He, who is not man, give it us.</p>

<p>3. Now this is what follows: and John says, <q>This my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> therefore is fulfilled.</q> What is his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? To <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the Bridegroom's voice. It is fulfilled in me, I have my <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; more I do not assume to myself, lest also I lose what I have received. What is this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? <q>With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> rejoices for the Bridegroom's voice.</q> A man may understand, then, that he ought not to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> of his own wisdom, but of the wisdom which he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let him ask nothing more, and he loses not what he found. For many, in that they affirmed themselves to be wise, became fools. The apostle convicts them, and says of them, <q>Because that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest to them; for God has showed it unto them.</q> Hear ye what he says of certain unthankful, ungodly men: <q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are seen, being understood by the things that are made, His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power likewise, and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.</q> Why without excuse? <q>Because, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> God</q> (he said not, <q>because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not</q>), <q>they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened: professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170316"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;1:19-22</a></span> If they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at the same time that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and none other, had made them wise; and they would not then attribute to themselves that which they did not have from themselves, but to Him from whom they had received it. But by their unthankfulness they became fools. Therefore, what God gave freely, He took from the unthankful. John would not be this; he would be thankful: he confessed to have received, and declared that he rejoiced for the Bridegroom's voice, saying, <q>Therefore this my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is fulfilled.</q></p>

<p>4. <q>He must increase, but I must decrease.</q> What is this? He must be exalted, but I must be humbled. How is Jesus to increase? How is God to increase? The perfect does not increase. God neither increases nor decreases. For if He increases, He is not perfect; if He decreases, he is not God. And how can Jesus increase, being God? If to man's estate, since He deigned to be man and was a child; and, though the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, lay an infant in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>; and, though His mother's Creator, yet sucked the milk of infancy of her: then Jesus having grown in age of the flesh, that perhaps is the reason why it is said, <q>He must increase, but I must decrease.</q> But why in this? As regards the flesh, John and Jesus were of the same age, there being six months between them: they had grown up together; and if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had willed to be here longer before His death, and that John should be here with Him, then, as they had grown up together, so would they have grown old together: in what way, then, <q>He must increase but I must decrease</q>? Above all, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> being now thirty years old, does a man who is already thirty years old still grow? From that same age, men begin to go downward, and to decline to graver age, thence to old age. Again, even had they both been lads, he would not have said, <q>He must increase,</q> but, We must increase together. But now each is thirty years of age. The interval of six months makes no difference in age; the difference is discovered by reading rather than by the look of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>5. What means, then, <q>He must increase, but I must decrease</q>? This is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! Before the Lord Jesus came, men were glorying of themselves; He came a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to lessen man's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to increase the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now He came without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and found all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If thus He came to put away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, God may freely give, man may confess. For man's confession is man's lowliness: God's pity is God's loftiness. Therefore, since He came to forgive man his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, let man acknowledge his own lowliness and let God show His pity. <q>He must increase, but I must decrease:</q> that is, He must give, but I must receive; He must be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, but I must confess. Let man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own condition, and confess to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and hear the apostle as he says to a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, elated man, bent on extolling himself: <q>What have you that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you did not receive it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170317"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Then let man understand that he has received; and when he would call that his own which is not his, let him decrease: for it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him that God be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in him. Let him decrease in himself, that he may be increased in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These testimonies and this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Christ and John signified by their deaths. For John was lessened by the Head: Christ was exalted on the cross; so that even there it appeared what this is, <q>He must increase, but I must decrease.</q> Again, Christ was born when the days were just beginning to lengthen; John was born when they began to shorten. Thus their very creation and deaths testify to the words of John, when he says, <q>He must increase, but I must decrease.</q> May the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God then increase in us, and our own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> decrease, that even ours may increase in God! For this is what the apostle says, this is what <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170318"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> Will you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in yourself? You will grow; but grow worse in your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For whoso grows worse is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> decreased. Let <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, who is ever perfect, grow, and grow in you. For the more you understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and apprehendest Him, He seems to be growing in you; but in Himself He grows not, being ever perfect. You understood a little yesterday; you understand more today, wilt understand much more tomorrow: the very light of God increases in you: as if thus God increases, who remains ever perfect. It is as if one's eyes were being cured of former blindness, and he began to see a little glimmer of light, and the next day he saw more, and the third day still more: to him the light would seem to grow; yet the light is perfect, whether he see it or not. Thus it is also with the inner man: he makes progress indeed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God seems to be increasing in him; yet man himself is decreasing, that he may fall from his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and rise into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. What we have just heard, appears now distinctly and clearly. <q>He that comes from above, is above all.</q> See what he says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What of himself? <q>He that is of the earth, is of earth, and speaks of the earth. He that comes from above is above all</q>&mdash; this is Christ; and <q>he that is of the earth, is of earth, and speaks of the earth</q>&mdash; this is John. And is this the whole: John is of the earth, and speaks of the earth? Is the whole testimony that he bears of Christ a speaking of the earth? Are they not voices of God that are heard from John, when he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Christ? Then how does he speak of the earth? He said this of man. So far as relates to man in himself, he is of earth, and speaks of the earth; and when he speaks some divine things, he is enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, were he not enlightened, he would be earth speaking of earth. God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is apart by itself, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man apart by itself. Do but examine the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man: man is born and grows, he learns the customs of men. What does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> but earth, of earth? He speaks the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, minds the things of men; carnal, he judges carnally, conjectures carnally: lo! It is man all over. Let the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God come, and enlighten his darkness, as it says, <q>You will lighten my candle, O Lord; my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, enlighten my darkness;</q>  let it take the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and turn it to its own light; immediately he begins to say, as the apostle says, <q>Yet not I, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God that is with me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170320"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:10</a></span> and, <q>Now I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170321"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> That is to say, <q>He must increase, but I must decrease.</q> Thus John: as regards John, he is of the earth, and speaks of the earth; whatever that is divine you have heard from John, is of Him that enlightens, not of him that receives.</p>

<p>7. <q>He that comes from heaven is above all; and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies: and no man receives His testimony.</q> Comes from heaven, is above all, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; of whom it was said above, <q>No man has ascended into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who is in heaven.</q> And He is above all; <q>and what He has seen and heard, that He speaks.</q> Moreover, He has a Father, being Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; He has a Father, and He also hears of the Father. And what is that which He hears of the Father? Who can unfold this? When can my tongue, when can my heart be sufficient, either the heart to understand, or the tongue to utter, what that is which the Son has heard from the Father? May it be the Son has heard the Word of the Father? Nay, the Son is the Word of the Father. You see how all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort is here wearied out; you see how all guessing of our heart, all straining of our darkened <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, here fails. I hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> saying that the Son speaks that which He hears from the Father; and again, I hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> saying that the Son is Himself the Word of the Father: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> The words that we speak are fleeting and transient: as soon as your word has sounded from your mouth, it passes away; it makes its noise, and passes away into silence. Can you follow your sound, and hold it to make it stand? Your thought, however, remains, and of that thought that remains you utter many words that pass away. What say we, brethren? When God spoke, did He give out a voice, or sounds, or syllables? If He did, in what tongue spoke He? In Hebrew, or in Greek, or in Latin? Tongues are necessary where there is a distinction of nations. But there none can say that God spoke in this tongue, or in that. Observe your own heart. When you conceive a word which you may utter&mdash;For I will say, if I can, what we may note in ourselves, not whereby we may comprehend that&mdash;well, when you conceive a word to utter, you mean to utter a thing, and the very conception of the thing is already a word in your heart: it has not yet come forth, but it is already born in the heart, and is waiting to come forth. But you consider the person to whom it is to come forth, with whom you are to speak: if he is a Latin, you seek a Latin expression; if a Greek, you think of Greek words; if a Punic, you consider whether you know the Punic language: for the diversity of hearers you have recourse to various tongues to utter the word conceived; but the conception itself was bound by no tongue in particular. Whilst therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when speaking, required not a language, nor took up any kind of speech, how was He heard by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, seeing that God's speaking is the Son Himself? As, in fact, you have in your heart the word that you speak, and as it is with you, and is none other than the spiritual conception itself (for just as your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is spirit, so also the word which you have conceived is spirit; for it has not yet received sound to be divided by syllables, but remains in the conception of your heart, and in the mirror of the mind); so God gave out His Word, that is, begot the Son. And you, indeed, begettest the word even in your heart according to time; God without time begot the Son by whom He created all times. Whilst, therefore, the Son is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and the Son spoke to us not His own word, but the word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He willed to speak Himself to us when He was speaking the word of the Father. This it is that John said, as was fit and necessary; and we have expounded according to our ability. He whose heart has not yet attained to a proper perception of so great a matter, has whither to turn himself, has where to knock, has from whom to ask, from whom to seek, of whom to receive.</p>

<p>8. <q>He that comes from heaven is above all; and what He has seen and heard, that testifies He; and His testimony no man receives.</q> If no man, to what purpose came He? He means, no man of a certain class. There are some people prepared for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be damned with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; of these, none receives the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if none at all, not any man, received, what could these words mean, <q>But he that received His testimony has set to his seal that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></q>? Not certainly, then, <em>no man</em>, if you say yourself, <q>He that received His testimony has set to his seal that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> Perhaps John, on being questioned, would answer and say, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I have said, in saying <em>no man</em>. There are, in fact, people born to God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and thereunto foreknown. For God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> who they are that will and that will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> who they are that shall persevere in that in which they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who that shall fall away; and all that shall be for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life are numbered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already the people set apart. And if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this, and has given to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> by His Spirit to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, He gave this also to John. Now John was observing, not with his eye&mdash;for as regards himself he is earth, and speaks of earth&mdash;but with that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit which he received of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he saw a certain people, ungodly, unbelieving. Contemplating that people in its unbelief, he says, <q>His testimony, who came from heaven, no man receives.</q> No man of whom? Of them who shall be on the left hand, of them to whom it shall be said, <q>Go into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> Who are they that do receive it? They who shall be at the right hand, they to whom it shall be said, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which is prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</q> He observes, then, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> a dividing, but in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> a mingling together; and that which is not yet separated locally, he separated in the understanding, in the view of the heart; and he saw two peoples, one of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, one of unbelievers. Fixing his thought on the unbelievers, he says, <q>He that comes from heaven is above all; and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies and no man receives His testimony.</q> He then turned his thought from the left hand, and looked at the right, and proceeded to say, <q>He that received His testimony has set to his seal that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> What means <q>has set to his seal that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> if it be not that man is a liar, and God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being can speak any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unless he be enlightened by Him who cannot lie. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Would you prove this? Receive His testimony and you find it. For <q>he that has received His testimony has set to his seal that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? The same who came from heaven, and is above all, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But if you do not yet understand Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have not yet received His testimony: receive it, and you put your seal to it; confidently you understand, definitely you acknowledge, that God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>9. <q>For He whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sent speaks the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Himself is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God sent Him: God sent God. Join both, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Ask concerning them singly, He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; ask concerning them both, they are God. Not individually <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and both Gods; but each individual <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and both God. For so great is the charity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> there, so great the peace of unity, that when you question about them individually, the answer to you is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when you ask concerning the Trinity, you get for answer, God. For if the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when it cleaves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is one spirit, as the apostle openly declares, <q>He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170322"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> how much more is the equal Son, joined to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with Him one God! Hear another testimony. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, when they sold all they had and laid it at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet, that it might be distributed to each according to his need; and what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> of that gathering of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? <q>They had one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and one heart in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170323"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> If charity made one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and one heart of so many hearts, how great must be the charity between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>! Surely it must be greater than that between those men who had one heart. If, then, the heart of many brethren was one by charity, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of many brethren was one by charity, would you say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son are two? If they are two Gods, there is not the highest charity between them. For if charity is here so great as to make your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and your friend's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how can it be then that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not one God? Far be unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from this thought. In short, how excellent that charity is, understand hence: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of many men are many, and if they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, it is one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; still, in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they may be called many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, because the union is not so strong. But there it is right for you to say one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; two or three Gods it is not right for you to say. From this, the supreme and surpassing excellency of charity is shown you to be such, that a greater cannot be.</p>

<p>10. <q>For He whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sent speaks the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> This, of course, he said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to distinguish himself from Christ. What then? Did not God send John himself? Did he not say himself, <q>I am sent before Him</q>? And, <q>He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water</q>? And is it not of John that it is said, <q>Behold, I send my messenger before You, and he shall prepare Your way</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note170324"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi&nbsp;3:1</a></span> Does he not himself speak the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he of whom it is said that he is more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Then, if God sent him too, and he speaks the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how do we understand him to have distinctly said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>He whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sent speaks the words of God</q>? But see what he adds: <q>For God gives not the Spirit by measure.</q> What is this, <q>For God gives not the Spirit by measure</q>? We find that God does give the Spirit by measure. Hear the apostle when he says, <q>According to the measure of the gift of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170325"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> To men He gives by measure, to the only Son He gives not by measure. How does He give to men by measure? <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of wisdom according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another discerning of spirits; to another kinds of tongues; to another the gift of healing. Are all <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? Are all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Are all teachers? Are all workers of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? Have all the gift of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170326"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-30</a></span> This man has one gift, that man another; and what that man has, this has not: there is a measure, a certain division of gifts. To men, therefore, it is given by measure, and concord among them makes one body. As the hand receives one kind of gift to work, the eye another to see, the ear another to hear, the foot another to walk; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that does all is one, in the hand to work, in the foot to walk, in the ear to hear, in the eye to see; so are also the gifts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> diverse, distributed to them as to members, to each according to his proper measure. But Christ, who gives, receives not by measure.</p>

<p>11. Now hear further what follows: because He had said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>For God gives not the Spirit by measure: the Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and has given all things into His hand,</q> He added, <q>has given all things into His hands,</q> that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also here with what distinction it is said, <q>The Father loves the Son.</q> And why? Does the Father not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> John? And yet He has not given all things into his hand. Does the Father not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? And yet He has not given all things into his hand. <q>The Father loves the Son:</q> but as father loves, not as master loves a servant; as the Only Son, not as an adopted son. And so <q>has given all things into His hand.</q> What means <q>all things</q>? That the Son should be such as the Father is. To equality with Himself He begot Him in whom it was no <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>The Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and has given all things into His hand.</q> Therefore, having deigned to send us the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, let us not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it is something less than the Father that is sent to us. The Father, in sending the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, sent His other self.</p>

<p>12. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, still thinking that the Father is something greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, seeing only the flesh, and not understanding His divinity, said to Him, <q>Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.</q> As much as to say, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You already, and bless You that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You: for we thank You that You have shown Yourself to us. But as yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the Father: therefore our heart is inflamed, and occupied with a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longing of seeing Your Father who sent You. Show us Him, and we shall desire nothing more of You: for it suffices us when He has been shown, than whom none can be greater.</q> A good longing, a good desire; but small intelligence. Now the Lord Jesus Himself, regarding them as small men seeking great things, and Himself great among the small, and yet small among the small, says to Philip, one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who had said this: <q>Am I so long time with you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip?</q> Here Philip might have answered, You we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but did we say to You, Show us Yourself? We have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You, but it is the Father we seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. He immediately adds, <q>He that has seen me, has seen the Father also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170327"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;14:8-9</a></span> If, then, One equal with the Father has been sent, let us not estimate Him from the weakness of the flesh, but think of the majesty clothed in flesh, but not weighed down by the flesh. For, remaining God with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He was made man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that, through Him who was made man, you might become such as to receive God. For man could not receive God. Man could see man; God he could not apprehend. Why could he not apprehend God? Because he had not the eye of the heart, by which to apprehend Him. There was something within disordered, something without sound: man had the eyes of the body sound, but the eyes of the heart sick. He was made man to the eye of the body; so that, believing on Him who could be seen in bodily form, you might be healed for seeing Him whom you were not able to see spiritually. <q>Am I so long time with you, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me not, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father also.</q> Why did they not see Him? Lo, they did see Him, and yet saw not the Father: they saw the flesh, but the majesty was concealed. What the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who loved Him saw, saw also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who crucified Him. Inwardly, then, was He all; and in such manner inwardly in the flesh, that He remained with the Father when He came to the flesh.</p>

<p>13. Carnal thought does not apprehend what I say: let it defer understanding, and begin by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; let it hear what follows: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son has everlasting life: and he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not the Son shall not see life; but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him.</q> He has not said, The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God comes to him; but, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him.</q> All that are born mortals have the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God with them. What <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God? That <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> first received. For if the first man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and heard the sentence, <q>You shall die the death,</q> he became mortal, and we began to be born mortal; and we have been born with the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From this stock came the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and He was clothed with flesh and mortality. If He partook with us of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are we slow to partake with Him the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God? He, then, that will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, on the same <q>the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides.</q> What <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God? That of which the apostle says, <q>We also were by nature the children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as the rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170328"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> All are therefore children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, because coming of the curse of death. Believe on Christ, for you made mortal, that you may receive Him, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; and when you shall have received His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, you shall no longer be mortal. He lived, you were dead; He died that you should live. He has brought us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has taken away the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God has conquered death, lest death should conquer man.</p>
