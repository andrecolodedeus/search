<h1>Tractate 16 (John 4:43-54)</h1>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> Lesson of today follows that of yesterday, and this is the subject of our discourse. In this passage the meaning, indeed, is not difficult of investigation, but worthy of preaching, worthy of admiration and praise. Accordingly, in reciting this passage of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, we must commend it to your attention, rather than laboriously expound it.</p>

<p>Now Jesus, after His stay of two days in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, <q>departed into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>,</q> where He was brought up. And the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, as he goes on, says, <q>For Jesus Himself testified that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country.</q> It was not because He had no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> departed thence after two days; for <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> was not His own country, but <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. Whilst, therefore, He left <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> so quickly, and came to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, where He had been brought up, how does He testify that <q>a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country</q>? Rather does it seem that He might have testified that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country, had He disdained to go into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and had stayed in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</p>

<p>2. Now mark well, beloved, while the Lord suggests and bestows what I may speak, that here is intimated to us no slight <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the question before us; seek ye out the solution of it. But, to make the solution desirable, let us repeat the theme. The point that troubles us is, why the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> said, <q>For Jesus Himself testified that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country.</q> Urged by this, we go back to the preceding words, to discover the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist's</a> intention in saying this; and we find him relating, in the preceding words of the narrative, that after two days Jesus departed from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. Was it for this, then, you said, O <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> testified that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country, just because He left <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> after two days, and made haste to come to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>? On the contrary, I should have thought it more likely, that if Jesus had no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in His own country, He should not have hastened to it, and left <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. But if I am not mistaken, or rather, because it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and I am not mistaken; for the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> saw what he was saying better than I can see it, saw the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> better than I do, he who drank it in from the Lord's bosom: for the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> is the same John who, among all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, reclined on the Lord's breast, and whom the Lord, owing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to all, yet loved above the rest. Is it he, then, that should be mistaken, and I right in my opinion? Rather, if I am piously-minded, let me obediently hear what he said, that I may be worthy of thinking as he thought.</p>

<p>3. Hear then, dearly beloved, what I think in this matter, without prejudice to your own judgment, if you have formed a better. For we have all one Master, and we are fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in one school. This, then, is my opinion, and see whether my opinion is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or near the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> He spent two days, and the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him; many were the days He spent in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and yet the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. Look back to the passage, or recall in memory the lesson and the discourse of yesterday. He came into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, where at first He had been preached by that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with whom He had spoken great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> at Jacob's well. After they had seen and heard Him, the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him because of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> word, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> more firmly because of His own word, even many more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: thus it is written. After passing two days there (in which number of days is <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> indicated the number of the two precepts on which hang the whole law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as you remember we intimated to you yesterday), He goes into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and comes to the city <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, where He made the water wine. And there, when He turned the water into wine, as John himself writes, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him; but, of course, the house was full with a crowd of guests. So great a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was wrought, and yet only His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him. He has now returned to this city of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. <q>And, behold, a certain ruler, whose son was sick, came to Him, and began to beseech Him to go down</q> to that city or house, <q>and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</q> Did he who besought not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? What do you expect to hear from me? Ask the Lord what He thought of him. Having been besought, this is what He answered: <q>Unless you see signs and wonders, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</q> He shows us a man lukewarm, or cold in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or of no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all; but eager to try by the healing of his son what manner of person Christ was, who He was, what He could do. The words of the suppliant, indeed, we have heard: we have not seen the heart of the doubter; but He who both heard the words and saw the heart has told us this. In short, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> himself, by the testimony of his narrative, shows us that the man who desired the Lord to come to his house to heal his son, had not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For after he had been informed that his son was whole, and found that he had been made whole at that hour in which the Lord had said, <q>Go your way, your son lives;</q> then he says, <q>And himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and all his house.</q> Now, if the reason why he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and all his house, was that he was told that his son was whole, and found the hour they told him agreed with the hour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> foretelling it, it follows that when he was making the request he did not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> had waited for no sign, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> simply His word; but His own fellow citizens deserved to hear this said to them, <q>Unless you see signs and wonders, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not;</q> and even there, notwithstanding so great a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was wrought, there did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> but <q>himself and his house.</q> At His discourse alone many of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; at that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, in the place where it was wrought, only that house <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. What is it, then, brethren, that the Lord does show us here? <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> was then the Lord's own country, because He was brought up in it. But now that the circumstance portends something&mdash;for it is not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that <q>prodigies</q> are so called, but because they portend or presage something: for the word <q>prodigy</q> is so termed as if it were <em>porrodicium, quod porro dicat</em>, what betokens something to come, and portends something future&mdash;now all those circumstances portended something, predicted something; let us just now assume the country of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> after the flesh (for He had no country on earth, except after the flesh which He took on earth); let us, I say, assume the Lord's own country to mean the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Lo, in His own country He has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Observe at this moment the multitudes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; observe that nation now scattered over the whole world, and plucked up by the roots; observe the broken branches, cut off, scattered, withered, which being broken off, the wild olive has deserved to be grafted in; look at the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: what do they say to us even now? <q>He whom you worship and adore was our brother.</q> And we reply, <q>A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country.</q> In short, those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw the Lord as He walked on the earth and worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; they saw Him giving sight to the blind, opening the ears of the deaf, loosing the tongues of the dumb, bracing up the limbs of the paralytics, walking on the sea, commanding the winds and waves, raising the dead: they saw Him working such great signs, and after all that scarcely a few <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. I am speaking to God's people; so many of us have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, what signs have we seen? It is thus, therefore, that what occurred at that time betokened what is now going on. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were, or rather are, like the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a>; we, like those <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. We have heard the gospel, have given it our consent, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ through the gospel; we have seen no signs, none do we demand.</p>

<p>4. For, though one of the chosen and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> twelve, yet he was an Israelite, of the Lord's nation, that Thomas who desired to put his fingers into the places of the wounds. The Lord censured him just as He did this ruler. To the ruler He said, <q>Unless you see signs and wonders, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not;</q> and to Thomas He said, <q>Because you have seen, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> He had come to the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a> after the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> His word, before whom He wrought no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, whom He without anxiety quickly left, strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because by the presence of His divinity He had not left them. Now, then, when the Lord said to Thomas, <q>Come, reach hither your hand, and be not faithless, but believing;</q> and he, having touched the places of the wounds, exclaimed, and said, <q>My Lord, and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> he is chided, and has it said to him, <q>Because you have seen, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> Why, but <q>because a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country?</q> But since this Prophet has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> among strangers, what follows? <q>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170351"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;20:29</a></span> We are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> here foretold; and that which the Lord by anticipation praised, He has deigned to fulfill even in us. They saw Him, who crucified Him, and touched Him with their hands, and thus a few <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; we have not seen nor handled Him, we have heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. May it be our lot, that the blessedness which He has promised may be made good in us: both here, because we have been preferred to His own country; and in the world to come, because we have been grafted in instead of the branches that were broken off!</p>

<p>5. For He showed that He would break off these branches, and ingraft this wild olive, when moved by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the centurion, who said to Him, <q>I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my child shall be healed: for I also am a man put under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. Jesus turned to those who followed Him, and said, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> Why not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? <q>Because a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in his own country.</q> Could not the Lord have said to that centurion, what He said to this ruler, <q>Go, your child lives?</q> See the distinction: this ruler desired the Lord to come down to his house; that centurion declared himself to be unworthy. To the one it was said, <q>I will come and heal him;</q> to the other, <q>Go, your son lives.</q> To the one He promised His presence; the other He healed by His word. The ruler sought His presence by force; the centurion declared himself unworthy of His presence. Here is a ceding to loftiness; there, a conceding to humility. As if He said to the ruler, <q>Go, your son lives;</q> do not weary me. <q>Unless you see signs and wonders, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not;</q> you desire my presence in your house, I am able to command by a word; do not wish to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in virtue of signs: the centurion, an alien, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> me able to work by a word, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> before I did it; you, <q>except ye see signs and wonders, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</q> Therefore, if it be so, let them be broken off as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> branches, and let the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> wild olive be grafted; nevertheless let the root remain, while those are cut off and these received in their place. Where does the root remain? In the patriarchs. For the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is Christ's own country, since it is of them that He came according to the flesh; but the root of this tree is <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarchs. And where are they? In rest with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; so that it was into <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom that the poor man, on being promoted, was raised after his departure from the body, and in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom was he seen from afar off by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> rich man. Wherefore the root remains, the root is praised; but the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> branches deserved to be cut off, and to wither away; and by their cutting off, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> wild olive has found a place.</p>

<p>6. Hear now how the natural branches are cut off, how the wild olive is grafted in, by means of the centurion himself, whom I have thought proper to mention for the sake of comparison with this ruler. <q>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; therefore I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west.</q> How widely the wild olive took possession of the earth! This world was a bitter forest; but because of the humility, because of this <q>I am not worthy&mdash; many shall come from the east and from the west.</q> And grant that they come, what shall become of them? For if they come, they are cut off from the forest; where are they to be ingrafted, that they may not wither? <q>And shall sit down,</q> says He, <q>with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob.</q> At what banquet, in case you do not invite to ever living, but to much drinking? Where, <q>shall sit down? In the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> And how will it be with them who came of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? What will become of the branches with which the tree was full? What but to be cut off, that these may be grafted in? Show us that they shall be cut off: <q>But the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170352"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;8:5-12</a></span> </p>

<p>7. Therefore let the Prophet have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> among us, because He had no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in His own country. He had no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in His country, wherein He was formed; let Him have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in the country which He has formed. For in that country was He, the Maker of all, made as to the form of a servant. For that city in which He was made, that Zion, that nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> He Himself made when He was with the Father as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: for <q>all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> Of that man we have today heard it said: <q>One Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, the man Christ Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170353"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> The Psalms also foretold, saying, <q>My mother is Sion, shall a man say.</q> A certain man, the Mediator man between God and men, says, <q>My mother Sion.</q> Why says, <q>My mother is Sion</q>? Because from it He took flesh, from it was the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, of whose womb He took upon Him the form of a servant; in which He deigned to appear most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. <q>My mother is Sion,</q> says a man; and this man, who says, <q>My mother is Sion,</q> was made in her, became man in her. For He was God before her, and became man in her. He who was made man in her, <q>Himself did found her; the Most High  was made man in her most low.</q> Because <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> <q>He Himself, the Most High, founded her.</q> Now, because He founded this country, here let Him have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. The country in which He was born rejected Him; let that country receive Him which He regenerated.</p>
