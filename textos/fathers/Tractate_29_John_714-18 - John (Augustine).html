<h1>Tractate 29 (John 7:14-18)</h1>

<p>1. What follows of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and was read today, we must next in order look at, and speak from it as the Lord may grant us. Yesterday it was read thus far, that although they had not seen the Lord Jesus in the temple on the feast-day, yet they were speaking about Him: <q>And some said, He is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man: but others said, Nay; but he seduces the people.</q> For this was said for the comfort of those who, afterwards preaching God's word, were to be seducers, and yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> men. <span class="stiki" id="note170572"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:8</a></span> For if to seduce is to deceive, neither was Christ a seducer, nor His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, nor ought any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to be such; but if to seduce (to lead aside) is by persuading to lead one from something to something else, we ought to inquire into the <em>whence</em> and the <em>whither</em>: if from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good, the seducer is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man; if from good to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the seducer is a bad man. In that sense, then, in which men are seduced from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good, would that all of us both were called, and actually were seducers!</p>

<p>2. Then afterwards the Lord went up to the feast, <q>about the middle of the feast, and taught.</q> <q>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> marvelled, saying, How <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this man letters, having never learned?</q> He who was in secret taught, He was speaking openly and was not restrained. For that hiding of Himself was for the sake of example; this showing Himself openly was an intimation of His power. But as He taught, <q>the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> marvelled;</q> all indeed, so far as I think, marvelled, but all were not converted. And why this wondering? Because all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> where He was born, where He had been brought up; they had never seen Him learning letters, but they heard Him disputing about the law, bringing forward testimonies of the law, which none could bring forward unless he had read, and none could read unless he had learned letters: and therefore they marvelled. But their marvelling was made an occasion to the Master of insinuating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> more deeply into their minds. By reason, indeed of their wondering and words, the Lord said something profound, and worthy of being more diligently looked into and discussed. On account of which I would urge you, my beloved, to earnestness, not only in hearing for yourselves, but also in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us.</p>

<p>3. How then did the Lord answer those that were marvelling how He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> letters which He had not learned? <q>My doctrine,</q> says He, <q>is not mine, but His that sent me.</q> This is the first profundity. For He seems as if in a few words He had spoken contraries. For He says not, This doctrine is not mine; but, <q>My doctrine is not mine.</q> If not Yours, how Yours? If Yours, how not Yours? For You say both: both, <q>my doctrines;</q> and, <q>not mine.</q> For if He had said, This doctrine is not mine, there would have been no question. But now, brethren, in the first place, consider well the question, and so in due order expect the solution. For he who sees not the question proposed, how can he understand what is expounded? The subject of inquiry, then, is that which He says, <q>My, not mine</q> this appears to be contrary; how <q>my,</q> how <q>not mine</q>? If we carefully look at what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> himself says in the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> thence hangs the solution of this question. What then is the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Father's Word? Therefore, Christ Himself is the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if He is the Word of the Father. But since the Word cannot be of none, but of some one, He said both <q>His doctrine,</q> namely, Himself, and also, <q>not His own,</q> because He is the Word of the Father. For what is so much <q>Yours</q> as Yourself? And what so much not Yours as Yourself, if that You are is of another?</p>

<p>4. The Word then is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it is also the Word of a stable, unchangeable doctrine, not such as can be sounded by syllables and fleeting, but abiding with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to which abiding doctrine let us be converted, being admonished by the transitory sounds of the voice. For that which is transitory does not so admonish us as to call us to transitory things. We are admonished to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. All this that I have said were syllables; they smote through the air to reach your sense of hearing, and by sounding passed away: that, however, which I advise you ought not so to pass away, because He whom I exhort you to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> passes not away; and when you, exhorted in transient syllables, shall have been converted, you shall not pass away, but shall abide with Him who is abiding. There is therefore in the doctrine this great matter, this deep and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> thing which is permanent: whither all things that pass away in time call us, when they mean well and are not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> put forward. For, in fact, all the signs which we produce by sounds do signify something which is not sound. For God is not the two short syllables <q>Deus,</q> and it is not the two short syllables that we worship, and it is not the two short syllables that we adore, nor is it to the two short syllables that we desire to come&mdash; two syllables which almost cease to sound before they have begun to sound; nor in sounding them is there room for the second until the first has passed away. There remains, then, something great which is called <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> although the sound does not remain when we say the word <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Thus direct your thoughts to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and you shall arrive at the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and when you have arrived at the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, consider this, <q>The Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and you will see that it was said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, <q>my doctrine:</q> consider also whose the Word is, and you will see that it was rightly said, <q>is not mine.</q></p>

<p>5. Therefore, to speak briefly, beloved, it seems to me that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> said, <q>My doctrine is not mine,</q> meaning the same thing as if He said, <q>I am not from myself.</q> For although we say and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son is equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that there is not any diversity of nature and substance in them, that there has not intervened any interval of time between Him that begets and Him that is begotten, nevertheless we say these things, while keeping and guarding this, that the one is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other the Son. But Father He is not if He have not a Son, and Son He is not if He have not a Father: but yet the Son is God from the Father; and the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not from the Son. The Father of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not God from the Son: but the other is Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and God from the Father. For the Lord Christ is called Light from Light. The Light then which is not from Light, and the equal Light which is not from Light, are together one Light not two Lights.</p>

<p>6. If we have understood this, thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but if any has not sufficiently understood, man has done as far as he could: as for the rest, let him see whence he may hope to understand. As laborers outside, we can plant and water; but it is of God to give the increase. <q>My doctrine,</q> says He, <q>is not mine, but His that sent me.</q> Let him who says he has not yet understood hear counsel. For since it was a great and profound matter that had been spoken, the Lord Christ Himself did certainly see that all would not understand this so profound a matter, and He gave counsel in the sequel. Do you wish to understand? Believe. For God has said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Unless you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170573"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> To the same purpose what the Lord here also added as He went on&mdash; <q>If any man is willing to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> concerning the doctrine, whether it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or whether I speak from myself.</q> What is the meaning of this, <q>If any man be willing to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a></q>? But I had said, if any man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and I gave this counsel: If you have not understood, said I, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For understanding is the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore do not seek to understand in order to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you may understand; since, <q>except ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand.</q> Therefore when I would counsel the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of believing toward the possibility of understanding, and say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has added this very thing in the following sentence, we find Him to have said, <q>If any man be willing to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the doctrine.</q> What is <q>he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q>? It is the same thing as <q>he shall understand.</q> But what is <q>If any man be willing to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a></q>? It is the same thing as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. All men indeed perceive that <q>shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q> is the same thing as <q>shall understand:</q> but that the saying, <q>If any man be willing to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>,</q> refers to believing, all do not perceive; to perceive this more accurately, we need the Lord Himself for expounder, to show us whether the doing of the Father's will does in reality refer to believing. But who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to work the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, to work that work which is pleasing to Him? But the Lord Himself says openly in another place: <q>This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170574"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;6:29</a></span> <q>That ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him,</q> not, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him. But if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <em>on</em> Him, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him; yet he that believes Him does not necessarily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <em>on</em> Him. For even the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him, but they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. Again, moreover, of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> we can say, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; but not, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Peter; but not, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Peter. For, <q>to him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him that justifies the ungodly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is counted unto him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170575"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> What then is <q>to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him</q>? By believing to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, by believing to esteem highly, by believing to go into Him and to be incorporated in His members. It is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself then that God exacts from us: and He finds not that which He exacts, unless He has bestowed what He may find. What <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but that which the apostle has most amply defined in another place, saying, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170576"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Not any <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of what kind soever, but <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q> let this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be in you, and you shall understand concerning the doctrine. What indeed shall you understand? That <q>this doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me;</q> that is, you shall understand that Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is not from Himself, but is the Son of the Father.</p>

<p>7. This sentence overthrows the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The Sabellians have dared to affirm that the Son is the very same as He who is also the Father: that the names are two, but the reality one. If the names were two and reality one, it would not be said, <q>My doctrine is not mine.</q> Anyhow, if Your doctrine is not Yours, O Lord, whose is it, unless there be another whose it is? The Sabellians understand not what You said; for they see not the trinity, but follow the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their own heart. Let us worshippers of the trinity and unity of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, understand concerning Christ's doctrine, how it is not His. And He said that He spoke not from Himself for this reason, because Christ is the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is the Father of Christ; and the Son is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is God not from God the Son.</p>

<p>8. <q>He that speaks of himself seeks his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: 'This will be he who is called <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>,' exalting himself,</q> as the apostle says, <q>above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is worshipped.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170577"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> The Lord, declaring that this same it is that will seek his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>I have come in my Father's name, and you have not received me; another will come in his own name, him you will receive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170578"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse45">John&nbsp;5:45</a></span> He intimated that they would receive <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who will seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his own name, puffed up, not solid; and therefore not stable, but assuredly ruinous. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has shown us a great example of humility: for doubtless He is equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> yea, doubtless, He Himself said, and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said, <q>Am I so long time with you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170579"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> Yea, doubtless, Himself said, and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said, <q>I and the Father are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170580"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> If, therefore, He is one with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, coeternal, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, alike unchangeable, alike without time, alike Creator and disposer of times; and yet because He came in time, and took the form of a servant, and in condition was found as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note170581"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> He seeks the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not His own; what ought thou to do, O man, who, when you do anything good, seekest your own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but when you do anything ill, dost meditate <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against God? Consider yourself: you are a creature, acknowledge your Creator: you are a servant, despise not your Lord: you are adopted, not for your own merits; seek His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from whom you have this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that you are a man adopted; His, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He sought who is from Him, the Only-begotten. <q>But He that seeks His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that sent Him, the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</q> In <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, however, there is unrighteousness, and he is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because he will seek his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not His by whom he was sent: for, indeed, he was not sent, but only permitted to come. Let us all, therefore, that belong to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seek not our own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that we be not led into the snares of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. But if Christ sought His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that sent Him, how much more ought we to seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who made us?</p>
