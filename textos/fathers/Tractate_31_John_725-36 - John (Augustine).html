<h1>Tractate 31 (John 7:25-36)</h1>

<p>1. You remember, beloved, in the former discourses&mdash;for it was both read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and also discussed by us according to our ability&mdash;how that the Lord Jesus went up to the feast-day, as it were in secret, not because He feared lest He should be laid hold of&mdash;He who had the power not to be laid hold of&mdash;but to signify that even in that very feast which was celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> He Himself was hidden, and that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the feast was His own. In the passage read today then, that which was supposed to be timidity appeared as power; for He spoke openly on the feast-day, so that the crowds marvelled, and said that which we have heard when the passage was read: <q>Is not this he whom they sought to kill? And, lo, he speaks openly, and they say nothing. Do the rulers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed that this is the Christ?</q> They who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> with what fierceness He was sought after, wondered by what power He was kept from being taken. Then, not fully understanding His power, they fancied it was the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the rulers, that these rulers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be the very Christ, and that for this reason they spared Him whom they had with so much eagerness sought out to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<p>2. Then those same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had said, <q>Did the rulers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the Christ?</q> proposed a question among themselves, by which it appeared to them that He was not the Christ; for they said in addition, <q>But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this man whence he is: but when Christ comes, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence he is.</q> As to how this opinion among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> arose, that <q>when Christ comes, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He is</q> (for it did not arise without reason), if we consider the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we find, brethren, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> have declared of Christ that <q>He shall be called a Nazarene.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170591"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;2:23</a></span> Therefore they foretold whence He is. Again, if we seek the place of His nativity, as that whence He is by birth, neither was this hidden from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which had foretold these things. For when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, on the appearing of a star, sought Him out to worship Him, they came to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and told him what they sought and what they meant: and he, having called together those who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the law, inquired of them where Christ should be born: they told him, <q>In <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Judah,</q> and also brought forward the prophetic testimony. <span class="stiki" id="note170592"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;2:6</a></span> If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had foretold both the place where the origin of His flesh was, and the place where His mother would bring Him forth, whence did spring that opinion among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which we have just heard, but from this, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> had proclaimed beforehand, and had foretold both? In respect of His being man, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> foretold whence He should be; in respect of His being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this was hidden from the ungodly, and it required godly men to discover it. Moreover, they said this, <q>When Christ comes, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He is,</q> because that which was spoken by Isaiah produced this opinion in them, viz. <q>And His generation, who shall tell?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170593"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;8:8</a></span> In short, the Lord Himself made answer to both, that they both did, and also did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence He was; that He might testify to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which before was predicted of Him, both as to the humanity of infirmity and also as to the divinity of majesty.</p>

<p>3. Hear, therefore, the word of the Lord, brethren; see how He confirmed to them both what they said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this man whence he is,</q> and also what they said, <q>When Christ comes, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He is. Then cried Christ in the temple, saying, You both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</q> That is to say, you both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me not; ye both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I am, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence I am. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I am: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> also ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For in this case, the birth of the Virgin alone was hidden, to whom, however, her husband was <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; for the same was able faithfully to declare this, who was also able as a husband to be jealous. Therefore, this birth of the Virgin excepted, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all that in Jesus pertains to man: His face was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, His country was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; where He was born was to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by inquiry. Rightly then did He say, <q>You both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I am,</q> according to the flesh and form of man which He bore; but according to His divinity, <q>And I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not;</q> but yet that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent, and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. For, <q>No man has seen God at any time, except the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170594"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and, <q>None <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170595"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Lastly, when He had said, <q>But He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not,</q> in order to show them whence they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, He subjoined, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him.</q> Therefore seek from me to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. But why is it that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him? <q>Because I am from Him, and He sent me.</q> Gloriously has He shown both. <q>I am from Him,</q> said He; because the Son is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and whatever the Son is, He is of Him whose Son He is. Hence we say that the Lord Jesus is God of God: we do not say that the Father is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but simply God: and we say that the Lord Jesus is Light of Light; we do not say that the Father is Light of Light, but simply Light. Accordingly, to this belongs that which He said <q>I am from Him.</q> But as to my being seen of you in the flesh, <q>He sent me.</q> When you hear,<q>He sent me,</q> do not understand a difference of nature to be meant, but the authority of Him that begets.</p>

<p>5. <q>Then they sought to take Him: but no man laid hands on Him, because His hour was not yet come;</q> that is, because He was not willing. For what is this. <q>His hour was not yet come</q>? The Lord was not born under <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. This is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning you, much less concerning Him by whom you were made. If your hour is His good will, what is His hour but His good will? He meant not therefore an hour in which He should be forced to die, but that in which He would deign to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But He was awaiting the time in which He should die, for He awaited also the time in which He should be born. The apostle, speaking of this time, says, <q>But when the fullness of time came, God sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170596"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many say, Why did not Christ come before? To whom we must make answer, Because the fullness of time had not yet come, while He by whom the times were made sets their bounds; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> when He ought to come. In the first place, it was necessary that He should be foretold through a long series of times and years; for it was not something insignificant that was to come: He who was to be ever held, had to be for a long time foretold. The greater the judge that was coming, the longer the train of heralds that preceded him. In short, when the fullness of time came, He also came who was to deliver us from time. For being delivered from time, we shall come to that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> where there is no time: there it is not said, When shall the hour come, for the day is everlasting, a day which is neither preceded by a yesterday, nor cut off by a morrow. But in this world days roll on, some are passing away, others come; none abides; and the moments in which we are speaking drive out one another in turn, nor stands the first syllable for the second to sound. Since we began to speak we are somewhat older, and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> I am just now older than I was in the morning; thus, nothing stands, nothing remains fixed in time. Therefore ought we to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by whom the times were made, that we may be delivered from time and be fixed in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, where there is no more changeableness of times. Great, therefore, is the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in that for our sakes He was made in time, by whom the times were made; that He was made among all things, by whom all things were made; that He became what He made. For He was made what He had made; for He was made man who had made man, lest what He had made should perish. According to this dispensation, the hour of His birth had now come, and He was born; but not yet had come the hour of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, therefore not yet had He suffered.</p>

<p>6. In short, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the words refer, not to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His dying, but to His power&mdash;I speak this for the sake of some who, when they hear <q>His hour was not yet come,</q> are determined on believing in <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, and their hearts become infatuated;&mdash; that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, that it was His power of dying, recollect the passion, look at Him crucified. While hanging on the tree, He said, <q>I thirst.</q> They, having heard this, offered to Him on the cross vinegar by a sponge on a reed. He received it, and said, <q>It is finished;</q> and, bowing His head, gave up the ghost. You see His power of dying, that He waited for this&mdash; until all things should be fulfilled that had been foretold concerning Him&mdash; to take place before His death. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had said, <q>They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</q>  He waited for all these things to be fulfilled: after they were completed, He said, <q>It is finished;</q> and He departed by power, because He came not by necessity. Hence some wondered more at this His power to die than at His ability to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For they came to the cross to take the bodies down from the tree, for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was drawing near, and the thieves were found still living. The punishment of the cross was so much the harder because it tortured men so long, and all that were crucified were killed by a lingering death. But the thieves, that they might not remain on the tree, were forced to die by having their legs broken, that they might be taken down thence. The Lord, however, was found to be already dead, <span class="stiki" id="note170598"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;19:28-33</a></span> and the men marvelled; and they who despised Him when living, so wondered at Him when dead, that some of them said, <q>Truly this was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170599"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse54">Matthew&nbsp;27:54</a></span> Whence also that, brethren, where He says to those that seek Him, <q>I am He;</q> and they, going backward, all fell to the ground? <span class="stiki" id="note170600"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;18:6</a></span> Consequently there was in Him supreme power. Nor was He forced to die at an hour; but He waited the hour on which His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> might fittingly be done, not that on which necessity might be fulfilled against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>But many of the people <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him.</q> The Lord made whole the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and the poor. The rulers were mad, and therefore they not only did not acknowledge the Physician, but even were eager to slay Him. There was a certain crowd of people which quickly saw its own sickness, and without delay recognized His remedy. See what that very crowd, moved by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, said: <q>When Christ comes will He do more signs than these?</q> Surely, unless there will be two Christs, this is the Christ. Consequently, in saying these things, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him.</p>

<p>8. But those rulers, having heard the assurance of the multitude, and that murmuring noise of the people in which Christ was being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, <q>sent officers to take Him.</q> To take whom? Him not yet willing to be taken. Because then they could not take Him while He would not, they were sent to hear Him teaching. Teaching what? <q>Then said Jesus, Yet a little while I am with you.</q> What ye wish to do now ye will do, but not just now; because I am not just now willing. Why am I now as yet unwilling? Because <q>yet a little while I am with you; and then I go unto Him that sent me.</q> I must complete my dispensation, and in this manner come to my suffering.</p>

<p>9. <q>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, there ye cannot come.</q> Here He has already foretold His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; for they would not acknowledge Him when present, and afterwards they sought Him when they saw the multitude already believing on Him. For great signs were wrought, even when the Lord was risen again and ascended into heaven. Then mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were done by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but He wrought by them as He wrought by Himself: since, indeed, He had said to them, <q>Without me you can do nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170601"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;15:5</a></span> When that lame man who sat at the gate rose up at Peter's voice, and walked on his feet, so that men marvelled, Peter spoke to them to this effect, that it was not by his own power that he did this, but in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Him whom they slew. <span class="stiki" id="note170602"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;3:2-16</a></span> Many pricked in the heart said, <q>What shall we do?</q> For they saw themselves bound by an immense crime of impiety, since they slew Him whom they ought to have revered and worshipped; and this crime they thought inexpiable. A great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> indeed it was, the thought of which might make them despair; yet it did not behoove them to despair, for whom the Lord, as He hung on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, deigned to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For He had said, <q>Father, forgive them; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170603"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> He saw some who were His own among many who were aliens; for these He sought pardon, from whom at the time He was still receiving injury. He regarded not that He was being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by them, but only that He was dying for them. It was a great thing that was forgiven them, it was a great thing that was done by them and for them, so that no man should despair of the forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when they who slew Christ obtained pardon. Christ died for us, but surely He was not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by us? But those men indeed saw Christ dying by their own villany; and yet they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ pardoning their villanies. Until they drank the blood they had shed, they despaired of their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore said He this: <q>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, you cannot come;</q> because they were to seek Him after the resurrection, being pricked in their heart with remorse. Nor did He say <q>where I will be,</q> but <q>where I am.</q> For Christ was always in that place whither He was about to return; for He came in such manner that He did not depart from that place. Hence He says in another place, <q>No man has ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170604"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> He said not, who was in heaven. He spoke on the earth, and declared that He was at the same time in heaven. He came in such wise that He departed not thence; and He so returned as not to abandon us. What do ye marvel at? This is God's doing. For man, as regards his body, is in a place, and departs from a place; and when he comes to another place, he will not be in that place whence he came: but God fills all things, and is all everywhere; He is not held in places according to space. Nevertheless the Lord Christ was, as regards His visible flesh, on the earth: as regards His invisible majesty, He was in heaven and on earth; and therefore He says, <q>Where I am, there ye cannot come.</q> Nor did He say, <q>You shall not be able.</q> but <q>you are not able to come;</q> for at that time they were such as were not able. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this was not said to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> despair, He said something of the same kind also to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Whither I go ye cannot come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170605"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;13:33</a></span> Yet while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in their behalf, He said, <q>Father, I will that where I am they also may be with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170606"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> And, finally, this He expounded to Peter, and says to him, <q>Whither I go you can not follow me now, but you shall follow me hereafter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170607"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;13:36</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>Then said the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> not to Him, but <q>to themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersion among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and teach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>?</q> For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they said; but, it being His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, they prophesied. The Lord was indeed about to go to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, not by His bodily presence, but still with His feet. What were His feet? Those which Saul desired to trample upon by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when the Head cried out to him, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170608"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> What is this saying that He said, <q>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, there ye cannot come?</q> Wherefore the Lord said this they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and yet they did predict something that was to be without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. For this is what the Lord said that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the place, if place however it must be called, which is the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from which Christ never departed; nor were they competent to conceive where Christ was, whence Christ never withdrew, whither He was to return, where He was all the while dwelling. How was it possible for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart to conceive this, least of all to explain it with the tongue? This, then, they in no wise understood; and yet by occasion of this they foretold our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that the Lord would go to the dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and would fulfill that which they read but did not understand. <q>A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> served me, and by the hearing of the ear <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me.</q>  They before whose eyes He was, heard Him not; those heard Him in whose ears He was sounded.</p>

<p>11. For of that Church of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which was to come, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had the issue of blood was a type: she touched and was not seen; she was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and yet was healed. It was in reality a figure what the Lord asked: <q>Who touched me?</q> As if not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, He healed her as unknown: so has He done also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. We did not get to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in the flesh, yet we have been made worthy to eat His flesh, and to be members in His flesh. In what way? Because He sent to us. Whom? His heralds, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, His servants, His redeemed whom He created, but whom He redeemed, His brethren also. I have said but little of all that they are: His own members, Himself; for He sent to us His own members, and He made us His members. Nevertheless, Christ has not been among us with the bodily form which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw and despised; because this also was said concerning Him, even as the apostle says: <q>Now I say that Christ was a minister of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170610"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;15:8</a></span> He owed it to have come to those by whose fathers and to whose fathers He was promised. For this reason He says also Himself: <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170611"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> But what says the apostle in the following words? <q>And that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might glorify God for His mercy.</q> What, moreover, says the Lord Himself? <q>Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170612"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;10:16</a></span> He who had said, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> how has He other sheep to which He was not sent, except that He intimated that He was not sent to show His bodily presence but to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only, who saw and killed Him? And yet many of them, both before and afterwards, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. The first harvest was winnowed from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that there might be a seed whence another harvest might spring up. But at this present time, when roused by the fame of the gospel, and by its goodly odor, His faithful ones among all nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, He shall be the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, when He shall come who has already come; when He shall be seen by all, He who was then not seen by some, by some was seen; when He shall come to judge who came to be judged; when He shall come to distinguish who came not to be distinguish ed. For Christ was not discerned by the ungodly, but was condemned with the ungodly; for it was said concerning Him, <q>He was accounted among the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170613"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> The robber escaped, Christ was condemned. He who was loaded with criminal accusations received pardon; He who has released from their crimes all who confess Him, was condemned. Nevertheless even the cross itself, if you consider it well, was a judgment-seat; for the Judge being set up in the middle, one thief who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> was delivered, the other who reviled was condemned. <span class="stiki" id="note170614"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;22:43</a></span> Already He signified what He is to do with the quick and the dead: some He will set on His right hand and others on His left. That thief was like those that shall be on the left hand, the other like those that shall be on the right. He was undergoing judgment, and He threatened judgment.</p>
