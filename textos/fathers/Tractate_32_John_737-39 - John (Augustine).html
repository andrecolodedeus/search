<h1>Tractate 32 (John 7:37-39)</h1>

<p>1. Among the dissensions and doubtings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, among other things which He said, by which some were confounded, others taught: <q>On the last day of that feast</q> (for it was then that these things were done) which is called the feast of tabernacles; that is, the building of tents, of which feast you remember, my beloved, that we have already discoursed, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> calls, not by speaking in any way soever, but by crying aloud, that whoso thirsts may come to Him. If we thirst, let us come; and not by our feet, but by our affections; let us come, not by removing from our place, but by loving. Although, according to the inner man, he that loves does also move from a place. But it is one thing to move with the body, another thing to move with the heart: he migrates with the body who changes his place by a motion of the body; he migrates with the heart who changes his affection by a motion of the heart. If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one thing, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> another thing before, you are not now where you were.</p>

<p>2. Accordingly, the Lord cries aloud to us: for, <q>He stood and cried out, if any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q> We are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to delay to inquire what this meant, since the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has explained it. For why the Lord said, <q>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink;</q> and, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water;</q> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has subsequently explained, saying: <q>But this spoke He of the Spirit which they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him should receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> There is therefore an inner thirst and an inner belly, because there is an inner man. And that inner man is indeed invisible, but the outer man is visible; but yet better is the inner than the outer. And this which is not seen is the more loved; for it is certain that the inner man is loved more than the outer. How is this certain? Let every man prove it in himself. For although they who live ill may surrender their minds to the body, yet they do wish to live, and to live is the property of the mind only; and they who rule, manifest themselves more than those things that are ruled. Now it is minds that rule, bodies are ruled. Every man rejoices in pleasure, and receives pleasure by the body: but separate the mind from it, and nothing remains in the body to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; and if there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the body, it is the mind that rejoices. If it has <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of its dwelling, ought it not to have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of itself? And if the mind has whereof it may have delight outside itself, does it remain without delights within? It is quite certain that a man loves his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than his body. But further, a man loves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even in another man more than the body. What is it that is loved in a friend, where the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the purer and more sincere? What in the friend is loved&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or the body? If fidelity is loved, the mind is loved; if benevolence is loved, the mind is the seat of benevolence: if this is what you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in another, that he too loves you, it is the mind you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because it is not the flesh, but the mind that loves. For therefore you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because he loves you: ask why he loves you, and then see what it is you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Consequently, it is more loved, and yet is not seen.</p>

<p>3. I would say something further, by which it may more clearly appear to you, beloved, how much the mind is loved, and how it is preferred to the body. Those wanton lovers even, who delight in beauty of bodies, and are charmed by shapeliness of limbs, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the more when they are loved. For when a man loves, and finds that he is regarded with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, he feels more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> than liking. Why does he feel <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than liking? Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that he bestows is not given him in return. If, therefore, even the lovers of bodies desire to be loved in return, and this delights them more when they are loved, what shall we say of the lovers of minds? And if the lovers of minds are great, what shall we say of the lovers of God who makes minds beautiful? For as the mind gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the body, so it is God that gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the mind. For it is only the mind that causes that in the body by which it is loved; when the mind has left it, it is a corpse at which you have a horror; and how much soever you may have loved its beautiful limbs, you make haste to bury it. Hence, the ornament of the body is the mind; the ornament of the mind is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>4. The Lord, therefore, cries aloud to us to come and drink, if we thirst within; and He says that when we have drunk, rivers of living water shall flow from our belly. The belly of the inner man is the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the heart. Having drunk that water then, the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> being purged begins to live; and drinking in, it will have a fountain, will be itself a fountain. What is the fountain, and what the river that flows from the belly of the inner man? Benevolence, whereby a man will consult the interest of his neighbor. For if he imagines that what he drinks ought to be only for his own satisfying, there is no flowing of living water from his belly; but if he is quick to consult for the good of his neighbor, then he becomes not dry, because there is a flowing. We will now see what it is that they drink who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Lord; because we surely are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we drink. And it is every man's duty to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in himself whether or not he drinks, and whether he lives by what he drinks; for the fountain does not forsake us if we forsake not the fountain.</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> explained, as I have said, whereof the Lord had cried out, to what kind of drink He had invited, what He had procured for them that drink, saying, <q>But this spoke He of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him should receive: for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> What spirit does He speak of, if not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? For every man has in himself a spirit of his own, of which I spoke when I was commending to you the consideration of the mind. For every man's mind is his own spirit: of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the spirit of the man which is in himself?</q> And then he added, <q>So also the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170615"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> None <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things that are ours but our own spirit. I indeed do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what are your thoughts, nor do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what are mine; for those things which we think within are our own, peculiar to ourselves; and his own spirit is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of every man's thoughts. <q>So also the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> We with our spirit, God with His: so, however, that God with His Spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also what goes on within us; but we are not able, without His own Spirit, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what takes place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in us even what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in ourselves. For Peter did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own weakness, when he heard from the Lord that he would deny Him thrice: the sick man was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his own condition; the Physician <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him to be sick. There are then certain things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in us, while we ourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them not. So far, however, as belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a man as he does himself: another does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is going on within him, but his own spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it. But on receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, we learn also what takes place in God: not the whole, for we have not received the whole. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many things from the pledge; for we have received a pledge, and the fullness of this pledge shall be given hereafter. Meanwhile, let the pledge console us in our pilgrimage here; because he who has condescended to bind himself to us by a pledge, is prepared to give us much. If such is the token, what must that be of which it is the token?</p>

<p>6. But what is meant by this which he says, <q>For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>?</q> He is understood to say this in a sense that is evident. For the meaning is not that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, which was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not in being; but was not yet in them who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Jesus. For thus the Lord Jesus disposed not to give them the Spirit of which we speak, until after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>; and this not without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And perhaps if we inquire, He will favor us to find; and if we knock, He will open for us to enter. Piety knocks, not the hand, though the hand also knocks, if it cease not from works of mercy. What then is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> determined not to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> until He should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>? Which thing before we speak of as we may be able, we must first inquire, lest that should trouble any one, in what manner the Spirit was not yet in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, while we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> concerning the Lord Himself newly born, that Simeon by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> recognized Him; that Anna the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, a prophetess, also recognized Him; <span class="stiki" id="note170616"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;2:25-38</a></span> that John, who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Him, recognized Him; <span class="stiki" id="note170617"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;1:26-34</a></span> that Zacharias, being filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, said many things; that Mary herself received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to conceive the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note170618"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35-79</a></span> We have therefore many preceding evidences of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> before the Lord was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the resurrection of His flesh. Nor was it another spirit that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also had, who proclaimed beforehand the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But still, there was to be a certain manner of this giving, which had not at all appeared before. For nowhere do we read before this, that men being gathered together had, by receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, spoken in the tongues of all nations. But after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when He first appeared to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He said to them: <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Of this giving then it is said, <q>The Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And He breathed upon their faces,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170619"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> He who with His breath enlivened the first man, and raised him up from the clay, by which breath He gave a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the limbs; signifying that He was the same who breathed upon their faces, that they might rise out of the mire and renounce their miry works. Then, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> calls His glorifying, did the Lord first give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Then having tarried with them forty days, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles shows, while they were seeing Him and companying with Him, He ascended into heaven in their sight. There at the end of ten days, on the day of Pentecost, He sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from above. Which having received, they, who had been gathered together in one place, as I have said, being filled withal, spoke in the tongues of all nations.</p>

<p>7. How then, brethren, because he that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and believes on Him, does not speak now in the tongues of all nations, are we not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he has received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? God forbid that our heart should be tempted by this faithlessness. Certain we are that every man receives: but only as much as the vessel of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that he shall bring to the fountain can contain, so much does He fill of it. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is even now received by men, some one may say, Why is it that no man speaks in the tongues of all nations? Because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself now speaks in the tongues of all nations. Before, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in one nation, where it spoke in the tongues of all. By speaking then in the tongues of all, it signified what was to come to pass; that by growing among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, it would speak in the tongues of all. Whoso is not in this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, does not now receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For, being cut off and divided from the unity of the members, which unity speaks in the tongues of all, let him declare for himself; he has it not. For if he has it, let him give the sign which was given then. What do we mean by saying, Let him give the sign which was then given? Let him speak in all tongues. He answers me: How then, do you speak in all tongues? Clearly I do; for every tongue is mine, namely, of the body of which I am a member. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, spread among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, speaks in all tongues; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in this body you are a member: therefore, since you are a member of that body which speaks with all tongues, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that thou too speakest with all tongues. For the unity of the members is of one mind by charity; and that unity speaks as one man then spoke.</p>

<p>8. Consequently, we too receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we are joined together by charity, if we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> name and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, brethren; as much as every man loves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so much has he the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the Spirit is given, as the apostle says, <q>to manifestation.</q> To what manifestation? Just as the same apostle says, <q>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> after the same Spirit, to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same Spirit, to another the gift of healing in one Spirit, to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the same Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170620"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> For there are many gifts given to manifestation, but thou, it may be, hast nothing of all those I have said. If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it is not <em> nothing</em> that you have: if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unity, whoever has anything in that unity has it also for you. Take away <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and what I have is yours too. The <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> temper puts men apart, soundness of mind unites them. In the body, the eye alone sees; but is it for itself alone that the eye sees? It sees both for the hand and the foot, and for all the other members. If a blow be coming against the foot, the eye does not turn away from it, so as not to take precaution. Again, in the body, the hand alone works, but is it for itself alone the hand works? For the eye also it works: for if a coming blow comes, not against the hand, but only against the face, does the hand say, I will not move, because it is not coming to me? So the foot by walking serves all the members: all the other members are silent, and the tongue speaks for all. We have therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> if we stand firm in its union and charity. For the apostle himself, after he had said that diverse gifts were bestowed on diverse men, just as the offices of the several members, says, <q>Yet I show you a still more pre-eminent way;</q> and begins to speak of charity. This he put before tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, before <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, before <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, before even that great work of mercy by which a man distributes to the poor all that he possesses; and, lastly, put it before even the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the body: before all these so great things he put charity. Have it, and you shall have all: for without it, whatever you can have will profit nothing. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the charity of which we are speaking refers to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (for the question now in hand in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>), hear the apostle when he says, <q>The charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170621"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> </p>

<p>9. Why then was it the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, seeing that the Spirit's benefits in us are the greatest, because by Him the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts, to give us that Spirit after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>? Why did He signify by this? In order that in our resurrection our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may be inflamed, and may part from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world to run wholly towards God. For here we are born and die: let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this world; let us migrate hence by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> let us dwell above, by that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by which we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. In this sojourn of our life let us meditate on nothing else, but that here we shall not always be, and that by good living we shall prepare a place for ourselves there, whence we shall never migrate. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, after that He is risen again, <q>now dies no more;</q> <q>death,</q> as the apostle says, <q>shall no more have dominion over Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170622"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Behold what we must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. If we live, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who is risen again, He will give us, not that which men <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> here who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the more the less they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this the less the more they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him; but let us see what He has promised us. Not earthly and temporal riches, not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and power in this world; for you see all these things given to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, that they may not be highly prized by the good. Not, in short, bodily health itself, though it is He that gives that also, but that, as you see, He gives even to the beasts. Not long life; for what, indeed, is long that will some day have an end? It is not length of days that He has promised to His <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, as if that were a great thing, or decrepit old age, which all wish for before it comes, and all murmur at when it does come. Not beauty of person, which either bodily disease or that same old age which is desired drives away. One wishes to be beautiful, and also to live to be old: these two desires cannot agree together; if you shall be old, you will not be beautiful; when old age comes, beauty will flee away; the vigor of beauty and the groaning of old age cannot dwell together in one body. All these things, then, are not what He promised us when He said, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, let him come and drink, and out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q> He has promised us <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, where we shall have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, where we shall not be troubled, whence we shall have no migration, where we shall not die; where there is neither bewailing a predecessor deceased, nor a hoping for a successor. Accordingly, because such is what He has promised to us that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and glow with the charity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, therefore He would not give us that same Spirit until He should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, so that He might show in His body the life which we have not now, but which we hope for in the resurrection.</p>
