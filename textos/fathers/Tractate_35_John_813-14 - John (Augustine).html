<h1>Tractate 35 (John 8:13-14)</h1>

<p>1. You who were present yesterday, bear in mind that we were a long while discoursing of the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, where He says, <q>I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life;</q> and if we wished to go on discoursing of that light, we might still speak a long time; for it would be impossible for us to expound the matter in brief. Therefore, my brethren, let us follow Christ, the light of the world, that we may not be walking in darkness. We must <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the darkness&mdash;not the darkness of the eyes, but that of the moral character; and even if it be the darkness of the eyes, it is not of the outer, but of the inner eyes, of those by which we discern, not between white and black, but between right and wrong.</p>

<p>2. When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had spoken these things, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered, <q>You bear record of yourself; your record is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> Before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> came, He lighted and sent many prophetic lamps before Him. Of these was also John Baptist, to whom the great Light itself, which is the Lord Christ, gave a testimony such as was given to no other man; for He said, <q>Among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170647"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> Yet this man, than whom none was greater among those born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, said of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <q>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in water; but He that is coming is mightier than I, whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170648"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;1:26-27</a></span> See how the lamps submits itself to the Day. The Lord Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that the same John was indeed a lamp: <q>He was,</q> says He, <q>a burning and a shining lamp; and you were willing for a season to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in his light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170649"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;5:35</a></span> But when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to the Lord, <q>Tell us by what authority you do these things,</q> He, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they regarded John the Baptist as a great one, and that the same whom they regarded as a great one had borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to them concerning the Lord, answered them, <q>I also will ask you one thing; tell me, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, whence is it? From heaven, or from men?</q> Thrown into confusion, they considered among themselves that, if they said, <q>From men,</q> they might be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by the people, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> John to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; if they said, <q>From heaven,</q> He might answer them, <q>He whom you confess to have been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> from heaven bore testimony to me, and you have heard from him by what authority I do these things.</q> They saw, then, that whichever of these two answers they made, they would fall into the snare, and they said, <q>We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> And the Lord answered them, <q>Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170650"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;21:23-27</a></span> <q>I tell you not what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because you will not confess what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> Most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, certainly, were they repulsed, and they departed in confusion; and that was fulfilled which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the psalm, <q>I have prepared a lamp for my Christ</q> (the lamp was John); <q>His enemies I will clothe with confusion.</q> </p> 

<p>3. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, then, had the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sent before Him, of the heralds that preceded the judge: He had <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from John; but He was Himself the greater <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> which He bore to Himself. But those men with their feeble eyes sought lamps, because they were not able to bear the day; for that same Apostle John, whose <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> we have in our hands, says in the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, concerning John the Baptist: <q>There was a man sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose name was John. He came for a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through him. He was not the light, but was sent to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light. That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, that lights every man coming into the world.</q> If <q>every man,</q> therefore also lights John. Whence also the same John says, <q>We all have received out of His fullness.</q> Wherefore discern ye these things, that your minds may profit in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that you be not always babes seeking the breasts and shrinking from solid food. You ought to be nourished and to be weaned by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to come to more solid food by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not by the belly. This discern ye then, that the light which enlightens is one thing, another that which is enlightened. For also our eyes are called lights;  and every man thus swears, touching his eyes, by these lights of his: <q>So may my lights live.</q> This is a customary <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Let these lights, if lights they are, be opened, and shine for you in your closed chamber, when the light is not there; they certainly cannot. Therefore, as these which we have in our face, and call lights, when they are both healthy and open, need the help of light from without&mdash;which being removed or not brought in, though they are sound and are open, yet they do not see&mdash;so our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, unless it be irradiated by the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and wondrously shone upon by Him who enlightens and is not enlightened, will not be able to come to wisdom nor to righteousness. For to live righteously is for us the way itself. But how can he on whom the light does not shine but stumble in the way? And hence, in such a way, we have need of seeing, in such a way it is a great thing to see. Now Tobias had the eyes in his face closed, and the son gave his hand to the father; and yet the father, by his instruction, pointed out the way to the son. <span class="stiki" id="note170653"><a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse11">Tobit&nbsp;2:11</a></span> </p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then answered, <q>You bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of yourself; your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> Let us see what they hear; let us also hear, yet not as they did: they despising, we believing; they wishing to slay Christ, we desiring to live through Christ. Let this difference distinguish our ears and minds from theirs, and let us hear what the Lord answers to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <q>Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I came and whither I go.</q> The light shows both other things and also itself. Thou lightest a lamp, for instance, to look for your coat, and the burning lamp affords you light to find your coat; do you light the lamp to see itself when it burns? A burning lamp is indeed capable at the same time of exposing to view other things which the darkness covered, and also of showing itself to your eyes. So also the Lord Christ distinguished between His faithful ones and His Jewish enemies, as between light and darkness: as between those whom He illuminated with the ray of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and those on whose closed eyes He shed His light. So, too, the sun shines on the face of the sighted and of the blind; both alike standing and facing the sun are shone upon in the flesh, but both are not enlightened in the eyesight. The one sees, the other sees not: the sun is present to both, but one is absent from the present sun. So likewise the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, is everywhere present, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is everywhere, wisdom is everywhere. One man in the east understands <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, another man in the west understands <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which the one understands a different thing from that which the other understands? In body they are far apart, and yet they have the eyes of their minds on one object. The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which I, placed here, see, if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it is, is the same which the just man, separated from me in the flesh by ever so many days' journey, also sees, and is united to me in the light of that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the light bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to itself; it opens the sound eyes and is its own <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that it may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the light. But how about the unbelievers? Is it not present to them? It is present also to them, but they have not eyes of the heart with which to see it. Hear the sentence fetched from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself concerning them: <q>And the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170654"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Hence the Lord says, and says <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, <q>Though I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself, my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I came and whither I go.</q> He meant us to understand the Father here: the Son gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father. Himself the equal glorifies Him by whom He was sent. How ought man to glorify Him by whom he was created!</p>

<p>5. <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I came and whither I go.</q> He who speaks to you in person has what He has not left, and yet He came; for by coming He departed not thence, nor has He forsaken us by returning there. Why marvel ye? It is God: this cannot be done by man; it cannot be done even by the sun. When it goes to the west it leaves the east, and until it returns to the east, when about to rise, it is not in the east; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> both comes and is there, both returns and is here. Hear the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> himself speaking in another place, and, if you can, understand it; if not, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>no man has ever seen, but the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him.</q> He said not <em>was</em> in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as if by coming He had quitted the Father's bosom. Here He was speaking, and yet He declared that He was there; and when about to depart hence, what said He? <q>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170655"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> </p>

<p>6. The <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light then is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whether it be manifesting itself or other things; for without light you can not see light, and without light you can not see any other thing whatever that is not light. If light is capable of showing other things which are not lights, is it not capable of showing itself? Does not that discover itself, without which other things cannot be made manifest? A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but whence had he it, unless he drew it from the fountain of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? John spoke a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but whence he spoke it, ask himself: <q>We all,</q> says he, <q>have received of His fullness.</q> Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is worthy to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Himself. But in any case, my brethren, let us who are in the night of this world hear also <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> with earnest attention: for now our Lord willed to come in humility to our weakness and the deep night-darkness of our hearts: He came as a man to be despised and to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, He came to be denied and to be confessed; to be despised and to be denied by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and confessed by us: to be judged and to judge; to be judged <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, to judge righteously. Such then He came that He behooved to have a lamp to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him. For what need was there that John should, as a lamp, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the day, if the day itself could be looked upon by our weakness? But we could not look upon it: He became weak for the weak; by infirmity He healed infirmity; by mortal flesh He took away the death of the flesh; of His own body He made a salve for our eyes. Since, therefore, the Lord has come, and since we are still in the night of the world, it behooves us to hear also prophecies.</p>

<p>7. For it is from <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that we convince gainsaying <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. Who is Christ? Says the pagan. To whom we reply, He whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold. What <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Asks he. We quote Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, and other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: we tell him that they came long before Christ, by what length of time they preceded His coming. We make this reply then: Prophets came before Him, and they foretold His coming. One of them answers: What <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? We quote for him those which are daily read to us. And, said he, Who are these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? We answer: Those who also foretold the things which we see come to pass. And he urges: You have forged these for yourselves, you have seen them come to pass, and have written them in what books you pleased, as if their coming had been predicted. Here in opposition to pagan enemies the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of other enemies offers itself. We produce books written by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and reply: Doubtless both you and they are enemies of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence are they scattered among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that we may convince one class of enemies by another. Let the book of Isaiah be produced by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and let us see if it is not there we read, <q>He was led as a sheep to be slaughtered, and as a lamb before his shearer was dumb, so He opened not His mouth. In humility His judgment was taken away; by His bruises we are healed: all we as sheep went astray, and He was delivered up for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170656"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;53:5-8</a></span> Behold one lamp. Let another be produced, let the psalm be opened, and thence, too, let the foretold suffering of Christ be quoted: <q>They pierced my hands and my feet, they counted all my bones: but they considered me and gazed upon me, they parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast the lot. My praise is with You; in the great assembly will I confess to You. All the ends of the earth shall be reminded, and be converted to the Lord: all countries of the nations shall worship in His sight; for the kingdom is the Lord's, and He shall have dominion over the nations.</q>  Let one enemy blush, for it is another enemy that gives me the book. But lo, out of the book produced by the one enemy, I have vanquished the other: nor let that same who produced me the book be left; let him produce that by which himself also may be vanquished. I read another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and I find the Lord speaking to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord, nor will I accept <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> at your hands: for from the rising of the sun even to his going down, a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered to my name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170658"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> Thou dost not come, O Jew, to a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; I prove you impure.</p>

<p>8. Behold, even lamps bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the day, because of our weakness, for we cannot bear and look at the brightness of the day. In comparison, indeed, with unbelievers, we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are even now light; as the apostle says, <q>For you were once darkness, but now light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170659"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and he says elsewhere, <q>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast away the works of darkness, and put on us the armor of light; let us walk honestly as in the day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170660"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;13:12-13</a></span> Yet that even the day in which we now are is still night, in comparison with the light of that to which we are to come, listen to the Apostle Peter: he says that a voice came to the Lord Christ from the excellent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <q>You are my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased. This voice,</q> said he, <q>which came from heaven, we heard, when we were with Him in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mount.</q> But because we were not there, and have not then heard this voice from heaven, the same Peter says to us, <q>And we have a more sure word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</q> You have not heard the voice come from heaven, but you have a more sure word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, foreseeing that there would be certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men who would <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, by attributing them to magical arts, sent <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> before Him. For, supposing He was a magician, and by magical arts caused that He should be worshipped after His death, was He then a magician before He was born? Hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, O man dead, and breeding the worms of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: I read, hear them who came before the Lord. <q>We have,</q> says the Apostle Peter, <q>a more sure word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, to which you do well to give heed, as to a lamp in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170661"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:17-19</a></span> </p>

<p>9. When, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> shall come, and, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also says, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the thoughts of the heart, that every man may have praise from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note170662"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> then, in presence of such a day, lamps will not be needed: no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall then be read to us, no book of an apostle shall be opened; we shall not require the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of John, we shall not need the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself. Accordingly all Scriptures shall be taken out of the way&mdash;which, in the night of this world, were as lamps kindled for us that we might not remain in darkness&mdash;when all these are taken away, that they may not shine as if we needed them, and the men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom these were ministered to us, shall themselves, together with us, behold that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and clear light. Well, what shall we see after these aids have been removed? Wherewith shall our mind be fed? Wherewith shall our gaze be delighted? Whence shall arise that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has gone up into the heart of man? What shall we see? I beseech you, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with me, by believing run with me: let us long for our home above, let us pant for our home above, let us feel that we are strangers here. What shall we see then? Let the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> now tell us: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> You shall come to the fountain from which a little dew has already besprinkled you: you shall see that very light, from which a ray was sent aslant and through many windings into your dark heart, in its purity, for the seeing and bearing of which you are being purified. John himself says, and this I cited yesterday: <q>Beloved, we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it has not yet appeared what we shall be: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him even as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170663"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> I feel that your affections are being lifted up with me to the things that are above: but the body, which is corrupt, weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and, the earthly habitation depresses the mind while meditating many things. <span class="stiki" id="note170664"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> I am about to lay aside this book, and you too are going to depart, every man to his own house. It has been good for us to have been in the common light, good to have been glad therein, good to have rejoiced therein; but when we part from one another, let us not depart from Him.</p>
