<h1>Tractate 39 (John 8:26-27)</h1>

<p>1. The words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, which He had addressed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, so regulating His discourse that the blind saw not, and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers'</a> eyes were opened, are these, which have been read today from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Then said the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Who are you?</q> Because the Lord had said before, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that I am, you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  To this accordingly they rejoined, <q>Who are you?</q> as if seeking to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on whom they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so as not to die in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He replied to those who asked Him: <q>Who are you?</q> by saying, <q>The beginning, for [so] also I speak to you.</q> If the Lord has called Himself the beginning, it may be inquired whether the Father also is the beginning. For if the Son who has a Father is the beginning, how much more easily must <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father be understood as the beginning, who has indeed the Son whose Father He is, but has no one from whom He Himself proceeds? For the Son is the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father certainly is the Father of the Son; but the Son is called God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;the Son is called Light of Light; the Father is called Light, but not, of Light&mdash;the Father is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, then, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, is the beginning, how much more easily may we understand as such that Light, from whom the Light [comes], and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom is God? It seems, therefore, absurd, dearly beloved, to call the Son the beginning, and not to call the Father the beginning also.</p>

<p>2. But what shall we do? Are there, then, two beginnings? Let us beware of saying so. What then, if both the Father is the beginning and the Son the beginning, how are there not two beginnings? In the same way that we call the Father <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet say not that there are two Gods; and yet He who is the Father is not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He who is the Son is not the Father; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the Spirit of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is neither the Father nor the Son. Although, then, as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ears have been taught in the bosom of mother Church, neither He who is the Father is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor He who is the Son is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, either the Son or the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet we say not that there are three Gods; although, if we are asked of each apart, we must, of whichever we are questioned, confess that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>3. But all this seems absurd to those who drag up familiar things to a level with things little <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, visible things with invisible, and compare the creature to the Creator. For unbelievers sometimes question us and say: Whom you call the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, do you call him God? We answer, God. Whom you call the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, do you call him God? We answer, God. Whom you call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, do you call him God? We answer, God. Then, say they, are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> three Gods? We answer, No. They are confounded, because they are not enlightened; they have their heart shut up, because they want the key of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Let us then, brethren, by an antecedent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that heals the eye of our heart, receive without obscurity what we understand&mdash;and what we understand not, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without hesitation; let us not quit the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in order to reach the summit of perfection. The Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is God: and yet He is not the Father who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor He the Son who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the Spirit of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is neither the Father nor the Son. The Trinity is one God. The Trinity is one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, one power, one majesty&mdash;three, [but not three] Gods. Let not the reviler answer me: <q>Three what, then? For,</q> he adds, <q>if there are three, you must say, three what?</q> I reply: The Father, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <q>See,</q> he says, <q>you have named three; but express what the three are?</q> Nay, count them yourself; for I make out three when I say, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For the Father is God as respects Himself, but [He is] the Father as respects the Son; the Son is God as respects Himself, but He is the Son as regards the Father.</p>

<p>4. What I say you may gather from daily analogies. So it is with one man and another, if the one be a father, the other his son. He is man as regards himself, but a father as regards his son; and the son man as respects himself, but a son as respects his father. For father is a name given relatively, and so with son; but these are two men. And certainly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is Father in a relative sense, that is, in relation to the Son; and God the Son is Son relatively, that is, in relation to the Father; but not as the former are two men are these two Gods. Why is it not so here? Because that belongs to one sphere and this to another; for this is divine. There is here something ineffable which cannot be explained in words, that there should both be, and not be, number. For see if there appear not a kind of number, Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash; the Trinity. If three, three what? Here number fails. And so God neither keeps apart from number, nor is comprehended by number. Because there are three, there is a kind of number. If you ask three what, number ceases. Hence it is said, <q>Great is our Lord, and great His power; and of His understanding there is no number.</q>  When you have begun to reflect, you begin to number; when you have numbered, you cannot tell what you have numbered. The Father is Father, the Son is Son, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. What are these three, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Are They not three Gods? No. Are They not three Almighties? No. Not three Creators of the world? No. Is the Father then almighty? Manifestly almighty. And is the Son then not almighty? Clearly the Son is also almighty. And is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> then not almighty? He, too, is almighty. Are there then three Almighties? No; only one Almighty. Only in Their relation to each other do They suggest number, not in Their essential <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is, as respects Himself, God along with the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, there are not three Gods; and, though as respects Himself He is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, as well as the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, there are not three omnipotents; for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He is the Father not in respect to Himself, but to the Son; nor is the Son so in respect to Himself, but to the Father; nor is the Spirit so as regards Himself, in as far as He is called the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. I have no name to give the three, save the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one Almighty. And so one beginning.</p>

<p>5. Take an illustration from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, whereby you may in some measure comprehend what I am saying. After <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> rose again, and was pleased to ascend into heaven, at the end of ten days He sent from thence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom those who were present in that one chamber were filled, and began to speak in the languages of all nations. The Lord's murderers, terrified by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, were pricked to the heart and sorrowed; sorrowing, were changed; and being changed, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. There were added to the Lord's body, that is, to the number of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, three thousand people. And so also by the working of another <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> there were added other five thousand. A considerable community was created, in which all, receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was kindled, were by their very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and fervor of spirit welded into one, and began in the very unity of fellowship to sell all that they had, and to lay the price at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet, that distribution might be made to every one as each had need. And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says this of them, that <q>they were of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and one heart toward God.</q>  Give heed then, brethren, and from this acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity, how it is we say, There is both the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and yet there is one God. See! There were so many thousands of these, and yet there was one heart; there were so many thousands, and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But where? In God. How much more so God Himself? Do I <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> at all in word when I call two men two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or three men three <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or many men many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? Surely I speak correctly. Let them approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belongs to all. If by approaching God many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> become one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and many hearts one heart, what of the very fountain of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the Father and Son? Is it not still more so here that the Trinity is one God? For thence, of that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, does <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> come to us, as the apostle says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170709"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> If then the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us, makes many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and many hearts one heart, how much rather are the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one light, and one beginning?</p>

<p>6. Let us hear, then, the Beginning who speaks to us: <q>I have,</q> said He, <q>many things to say of you and to judge.</q> You remember that He said, <q>I do not judge any one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170710"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;8:15</a></span> See, now He says, <q>I have many things to say of you and to judge.</q> But, <q>I do not judge</q> is one thing: <q>I have to judge</q> is another; for He had come to save the world, not to judge the world.  In saying, <q>I have many things to say of you and to judge,</q> He speaks of the future judgment. For therefore did He ascend, that He may come to judge the living and the dead. No one will judge more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> than He who was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> judged. <q>Many things,</q> said He, <q>have I to say of you and to judge; but He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> See how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, His equal, gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father. For He sets us an example, and says as it were in our hearts: O believer, if you hear my gospel, the Lord your God says to you, when I, in the beginning <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, coeternal with Him that begot, give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Him whose Son I am, how can you be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> before Him, whose servant you are?</p>

<p>7. <q>I have many things,</q> He said, <q>to say of you and to judge: but He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>;</q> as if He had said, Therefore I judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because, as the Son of the True One, I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Father <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Son the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;which do we account the greater? Let us reflect, if we can, which is the greater, the True One or the Truth.  Take some other instances. Is a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the more comprehensive? Surely <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> itself; for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, not <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> may still exist, though he who was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> became impious. He has lost his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but has taken nothing from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> itself. What also of comely and comeliness? Comeliness is more than comely; for comeliness gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to the comely, not the comely to comeliness. And so of chaste and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Chastity is clearly something more than chaste. For if <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, one would have no ground to be chaste; but though one may refuse to be chaste, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> remains entire. If then the term <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> implies more than the term <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, comeliness more than comely, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than chaste, shall we say that the Truth is more than the True One? If we say so, we shall begin to say that the Son is greater than the Father. For the Lord Himself says most distinctly, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170713"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> Therefore, if the Son is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what is the Father but what the Truth Himself says, <q>He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></q>? The Son is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Father <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. I inquire which is the greater, but find equality. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> not because He contained a part of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but because He begot it entire.</p>

<p>8. I see I must speak more plainly. And, not to detain you long, let me treat only of this point today. When I have finished what, with God's help, I wish to say, my discourse shall close. I have said this, then, to enlist your attention. Every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as being a thing, is mutable; and although a great creature, yet a creature; though superior to the body, yet made. Every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, since it is changeable&mdash; that is, sometimes believes, sometimes disbelieves; at one time wishes, at another time refuses; at one time is adulterous, at another chaste; now good, and again <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>&mdash;is changeable. But God is that which is, and so has retained as His own peculiar name, <q>I am who am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170714"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> Such also is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when He says, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that I am;</q> and thereto pertains also, <q>Who are you? The Beginning</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse25">John 8:25</a></span>. God therefore is unchangeable, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> changeable. When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives from God the elements of its goodness it becomes good by participation, just as by participation your eye sees. For it sees not when the light is withdrawn, while so long as it shares in the light it sees. Since then by participation the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made good, if <em> it</em> changes and becomes bad, the goodness remains that made it good. For there is a goodness of which it partook when good; and when it has turned to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that goodness continues entire. If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fall away and become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there is no lessening of goodness; if it return and become good, that goodness is not enlarged. Your eye participates in this light, and you see. Is it shut? Then you have not diminished the light. Is it open? You have not increased the light. By this illustration, brethren, understand that if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is partaker; if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is chaste, there is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which it partakes; if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is goodness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which it partakes; if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is partaker. Whereof if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is no partaker, every man is false;  and if every man may be false, no man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of himself.  But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Himself,  for He begot the Truth. It is one thing to say, That man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for he has taken in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: it is another, God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for He begot the Truth. See then how God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;not by participating in, but by generating the Truth. I see you have understood me, and am glad. Let this suffice you today. The rest, according as He gives it, we shall expound when the Lord pleases.</p>
