<h1>Tractate 3 (John 1:15-18)</h1>

<p>We undertook, in the name of the Lord, and promised to you, beloved, to treat of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, full of which the only-begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, appeared to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and to show how, as a matter belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, it is to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Give, then, your attention that what I receive in my measure from God you in your measure may receive and hear the same. For it will only remain if, when the seed is scattered in your hearts, the birds take it not away, nor thorns choke it, nor heat scorch it, and there descend upon it the rain of daily exhortations and your own good thoughts, by which that is done in the heart which in the field is done by means of harrows, so that the clod is broken, and the seed covered and enabled to germinate: that you bear fruit at which the husbandman may be glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. But if, in return for good seed and good rain, you bring forth not fruit but thorns, the seed will not be blamed, nor will the rain be in fault; but for thorns due fire is prepared. <span class="stiki" id="note170043"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;13:3-25</a></span> </p>

<p>2. I do not think that I need spend much time in endeavoring to persuade you that we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men; and if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by virtue of the name, belonging to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Upon the forehead we bear His sign; and we do not blush because of it, if we also bear it in the heart. His sign is His humility. By a star the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him; <span class="stiki" id="note170044"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and this sign was given by the Lord, and it was heavenly and beautiful. He did not desire that a star should be His sign on the forehead of the faithful, but His cross. By it humbled, by it also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; by it He raised the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, even by that to which He, when humbled, descended. We belong, then, to the gospel, we belong to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <q>The law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> We ask the apostle, and he says to us, since we are not under the law but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note170045"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;6:14</a></span> <q>He sent therefore His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, that He might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170046"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> Behold, for this end Christ came, that He might redeem those who were under the law; that now we may not be under the law, but under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Who, then, gave the law? He gave the law who gave likewise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but the law He sent by a servant, with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He Himself came down. And in what manner were men made under the law? By not fulfilling the law. For he who fulfills the law is not under the law, but with the law; but he who is under the law is not raised up, but pressed down by the law. All men, therefore, being placed under the law, are by the law made guilty; and for this purpose it is over their head, that it may show <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not take them away. The law then commands, the Giver of the law shows pity in that which the law commands. Men, endeavoring by their own strength to fulfill that which the law commands, fell by their own rash and headstrong presumption; and not with the law, but under the law, became guilty: and since by their own strength they were unable to fulfill the law, and had become guilty under the law, they implored the aid of the Deliverer; and the guilt which the law brought caused sickness to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. The sickness of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> became the confession of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Now the sick confess that they are sick; let the physician come to heal the sick.</p>

<p>3. Who is the Physician? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>? He who was seen even by those by whom He was crucified. He who was seized, buffeted, scourged, spit upon, crowned with thorns, suspended upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, died, pierced by the spear, taken down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, laid in the sepulchre. That same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, that same Jesus exactly, He is the complete Physician of our wounds. That crucified One at whom insults were cast, and while He hung on the cross His persecutors wagging the head, and saying, <q>If he be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let him come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170047"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;27:39-40</a></span> &mdash; He, and no other, is our complete Physician. Wherefore, then, did He not show to his deriders that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; so that if He allowed Himself to be lifted up upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, at least when they said, <q>If he be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let him come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,</q> He should then come down, and show to them that He was the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> whom they had dared to deride? He would not. Wherefore would He not? Was it because He could not? Manifestly He could. For which is greater, to descend from the cross or to rise from the sepulchre? But He bore with His insulters; for the cross was taken not as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of power, but as an example of patience. There He cured your wounds, where He long bore His own; there He healed you of death <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, where He vouchsafed to die the temporal death. And did He die, or in Him did death die? What a death was that, which slew death!</p>

<p>4. Is it, however, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself&mdash; His whole self&mdash; who was seen, and held, and crucified? Is the whole very self that? It is the same, but not the whole, that which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw; this is not the whole Christ. And what is? <q>In the beginning was the Word.</q> In what beginning? <q>And the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And what word? <q>And the Word was God.</q> Was then perhaps this Word made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? No. For <q>the same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> What then? Are the other things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not like the Word? No: because <q>all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.</q> In what manner were all things made by Him? Because <q>that which was made in Him was life;</q> and before it was made there was life. That which was made is not life; but in the art, that is, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before it was made, it was life. That which was made passes away; that which is in wisdom cannot pass away. There was life, therefore, in that which was made. And what sort of life, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is the life of the body? Our body has its own life; and when it has lost it, the death of the body ensues. Was then the life such as this? No; but <q>the life was the light of men.</q> Was it the light of cattle? For this light is the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of cattle. There is a certain light of men: let us see how far men differ from the cattle, and then we shall understand what is the light of men. Thou dost not differ from the cattle except in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; do not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in anything besides. Do you presume upon your strength? By the wild beasts you are surpassed. Upon your swiftness do you presume? By the flies you are surpassed. Upon your beauty do you presume? How great beauty is there in the feathers of a peacock! Wherein then are you better? In the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Where is the image of God? In the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. If then you are in this respect better than the cattle, that you have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by which you may understand what the cattle cannot understand; and therein a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because better than the cattle; the light of men is the light of minds. The light of minds is above minds and surpasses all minds. This was that life by which all things were made.</p>

<p>5. Where was it? Was it here? Was it with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and was it not here? Or, what is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, was it both with the Father and here also? If then it was here, wherefore was it not seen? Because <q>the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> Oh men, be not darkness, be not unbelieving, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, unrighteous, rapacious, avaricious lovers of this world: for these are the darkness. The light is not absent, but you are absent from the light. A blind man in the sunshine has the sun present to him, but is himself absent from the sun. Be not then darkness. For this is perhaps the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> regarding which we are about to speak, that now we be no more darkness, and that the apostle may say to us, <q>We were sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170048"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Because then the light of men was not seen, that is, the light of minds, there was a necessity that a man should give testimony regarding the light, who was not in darkness, but who was already enlightened; and nevertheless, because enlightened, not the light itself, <q>but that He might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light.</q> For <q>he was not that light.</q> And what was the light? <q>That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which enlightened every man that comes into the world.</q> And where was that light? <q>In this world it was.</q> And how was it <q>in this world?</q> As the light of the sun, of the moon, and of lamps, was that light thus in the world? No. Because <q>the world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not;</q> that is to say, <q>the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> For the world is darkness; because the lovers of the world are the world. For did not the creature acknowledge its Creator? The heavens gave testimony by a star; <span class="stiki" id="note170049"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;2:2</a></span> the sea gave testimony, and bore its Lord when He walked upon it; <span class="stiki" id="note170050"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;14:26</a></span> the winds gave testimony, and were quiet at His bidding; <span class="stiki" id="note170051"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;23:27</a></span> the earth gave testimony, and trembled when He was crucified. <span class="stiki" id="note170052"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse51">Matthew&nbsp;27:51</a></span> If all these gave testimony, in what sense did the world not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, unless that the world signifies the lovers of the world, those who with their hearts dwell in the world? And the world is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because the inhabitants of the world are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; just as a house is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not because of its walls, but because of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>6. <q>He came unto His own;</q> that is to say, He came to that which belonged to Himself; <q>and His own received Him not.</q> What, then, is the hope, unless that <q>as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God</q>? If they become sons, they are born; if born, how are they born? Not of flesh, <q>nor of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man; but of God are they born.</q> Let them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, therefore, that they are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let them receive the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they are born of God: <q>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.</q> If the Word was not ashamed to be born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, are men ashamed to be born of God? And because He did this, He cured us; and because He cured us, we see. For this, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us,</q> became a medicine unto us, so that as by earth we were made blind, by earth we might be healed; and having been healed, might behold what? <q>And we beheld,</q> he says, <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the Only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>7. <q>John bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Him, and cries, saying, This was He of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is made before me.</q> He came after me, and He preceded me. What is it, <q>He is made before me</q>? He preceded me. Not was made before I was made, but was preferred before me, this is <q>He was made before me.</q> Wherefore was He made before you, when He came after you? <q>Because He was before me.</q> Before you, O John! What great thing to be before you! It is well that you bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him; let us, however, hear Himself saying, <q>Even before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170053"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John&nbsp;8:58</a></span> But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> also was born in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: there were many before him, many after him. Listen to the voice of the Father to the Son: <q>Before Lucifer I have begotten You.</q>  He who was begotten before Lucifer Himself illuminates all. A certain one was named Lucifer, who fell; for he was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and concerning him the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> said, <q>Lucifer, who did arise in the morning, fell.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170055"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse27">Isaiah&nbsp;14:27</a></span> And why was he <em>Lucifer</em>? Because, being enlightened, he gave forth light. But for what reason did he become dark! Because he abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note170056"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> Therefore He was before Lucifer, before every one that is enlightened; since before every one that is enlightened, of necessity He must be by whom all are enlightened who can be enlightened.</p>

<p>8. Therefore this follows: <q>And of His fullness have all we received.</q> What have ye received? <q>And <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> For so run the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as we find by a comparison of the Greek copies. He does not say, And of His fullness have all we received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but thus He says: <q>And of His fullness have all we received, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q>&mdash; that is, have we received; so that He would wish us to understand that we have received from His fullness something unexpressed, and something besides, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For we received of His fullness <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the first instance; and again we received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. What <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did we, in the first instance, receive? Faith: walking in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we walk in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. How have we merited this? By what previous merits of ours? Let not each one flatter himself, but let him return into his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, seek out the secret places of his own thoughts, recall the series of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; let him not consider what he is if now he is something, but what he was that he might be something: he will find that he was not worthy of anything save punishment. If, then, you were worthy of punishment, and He came not to punish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was given to you, and not reward rendered. Wherefore is it called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? Because it is bestowed gratuitously. For you did not, by previous merits, purchase that which you received. This first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then, the sinner received, that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven. What did he deserve? Let him interrogate <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he finds punishment; let him interrogate mercy, he finds <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But God promised this also through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; therefore, when He came to give what He had promised, He not only gave <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. How was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> exhibited? Because that was done which had been promised.</p>

<p>9. What, then, is <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q>? By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we render God favorable to us; and inasmuch as we were not worthy to have our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven, and because we, who were unworthy, received so great a benefit, it is called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. What is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? That which is freely given. What is <q>freely given</q>? Given, not paid. If it was due, wages were given, not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed; but if it was reply due, you were good; but if, as is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, you were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him who justifies the ungodly <span class="stiki" id="note170057"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> (What is, Who justifies the ungodly? Of the ungodly makes <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>), consider what did by right hang over you by the law, and what you have obtained by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But having obtained that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you shall be just by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>);  and you shall obtain favor of God by living by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And having obtained favor from God by living by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you shall receive <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> as a reward, and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And that is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For because of what merit do you receive life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? Because of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is, as it were, the wages of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, appears to bestow <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life as if it were due (To whom due? To the faithful, because he had merited it by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>); but because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> also is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>10. Listen to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> acknowledging <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and afterwards desiring the payment of a debt. What acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is there in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? <q>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained,</q> says he, <q>mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170059"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:13</a></span> He said that he who obtained it was unworthy; that he had, however, obtained it, not through his own merits, but through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Listen to him now demanding the payment of a debt, who had first received unmerited <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: <q>For,</q> says he, <q>I am now ready to be offered up, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170060"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6-8</a></span> Now he demands a debt, he exacts what is due. For consider the following words: <q>Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall render unto me in that day.</q> That he might in the former instance receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he stood in need of a merciful Father; for the reward of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judge. Will He who did not condemn the ungodly man condemn the faithful man? And yet, if you rightly consider, it was He who first gave you <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby you obtained favor; for not of your own did you so obtain favor that anything should be due to you. Wherefore, then, in afterwards bestowing the reward of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, He crowns His own gifts, not your merits. Therefore, brethren, <q>we all of His fullness have received;</q> of the fullness of His mercy, of the abundance of His goodness have we received. What? The remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that we might be justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And what besides? <q>And <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>;</q> that is, for this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by which we live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we shall receive another <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. What, then, is it except <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? For if I shall say that this also is due, I attribute something to myself as if to me it were due. But God crowns in us the gifts of His own mercy; but on condition that we walk with perseverance in that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which in the first instance we received</p>

<p>11. <q>For the law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>;</q> which law held the guilty. For what says the apostle? <q>The law entered that the offense might abound.</q> It was a benefit to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> that the offense abounded, for they gave much to themselves, and, as it were, attributed much to their own strength; and they were unable to fulfill righteousness without the aid of Him who had commanded it. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, desirous to subdue their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, gave the law, as if saying: Behold, fulfill, and do not think that there is One wanting to command. One to command is not wanting, but one to fulfill.</p>

<p>12. If, then, there is one wanting to fulfill, whence does he not fulfill? Because born with the heritage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death. Born of Adam, he drew with him that which was there conceived. The first man fell, and all who were born of him from him derived the concupiscence of the flesh. It was needful that another man should be born who derived no concupiscence. A man and a man: a man to death and a man to life. Thus says the apostle: <q>Since, indeed, by man death, by man also the resurrection of the dead.</q> By which man death, and by which man the resurrection of the dead? Do not make haste: he goes on to say, <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170061"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-22</a></span> Who belong to Adam? All who are born of Adam. Who to Christ? All who were born through Christ. Wherefore all in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Because no one was born except through Adam. But that they were born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was of necessity, arising from damnation; to be born through Christ is of will and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Men are not compelled to be born through Christ: not because they wished were they born of Adam. All, however, who are of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> are sinners with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: all who are through Christ are justified, and just not in themselves, but in Him. For in themselves, if you should ask, they belong to Adam: in Him, if you should ask, they belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore? Because He, the Head, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, did not come with the heritage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but He came nevertheless with mortal flesh.</p>

<p>13. Death was the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; in the Lord was the gift of mercy, not the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the Lord had nothing on account of which He should <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> die. He Himself says, <q>Behold, the prince of this world comes, and finds nothing in me.</q> Wherefore then dost Thou die? <q>But that all may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father, arise, let us go hence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170062"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30-31</a></span> He had not in Himself any reason why He should die, and He died: you have such a reason, and do you refuse to die? Do not refuse to bear with an equal mind your desert, when He did not refuse to suffer, to deliver you from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. A man and a man; but the one nothing but man, the other God-man. The one a man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the other of righteousness. You died in Adam, rise in Christ; for both are due to you. Now you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, render nevertheless that which you owe through Adam. But the chain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not hold you <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>; because the temporal death of your Lord slew your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. The same is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, my brethren, the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because promised and manifested.</p>

<p>14. This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, because the law threatened, did not bring aid; commanded, did not heal; made manifest, but did not take away our feebleness: but it prepared the way for that Physician who was to come with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as a physician who, about to come to any one to cure him, might first send his servant that he might find the sick man bound. He was not sound; he did not wish to be made sound and lest he should be made sound, he boasted that he was so. The law was sent, it bound him; he finds himself accused, now, he exclaims against the bandage. The Lord comes, cures with somewhat bitter and sharp medicines: for He says to the sick, Bear; He says, Endure; He says, Love not the world, have patience, let the fire of continence cure you, let your wounds endure the sword of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. Were you greatly terrified although bound? He, free and unbound, drank what He gave to you; He first suffered that He might console you, saying, as it were, that which you fear to suffer for yourself, I first suffer for you. This is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Who can praise it in a worthy manner?</p>

<p>15. I speak, my brethren, regarding the humility of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Who can speak regarding the majesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the divinity of Christ? In explaining and speaking of the humility of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to do so in any fashion we find ourselves not sufficient, indeed wholly insufficient: we commend Him entire to your thoughts, we do not endeavor to fill Him up to your hearing. Consider the humility of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But who, you say, may explain it to us, unless you declare it? Let Him declare it within. Better does He declare it who dwells within, than he who cries without. Let Himself show to you the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His humility, who has begun to dwell in your hearts. But now, if in explaining and setting forth His humility we are deficient, who can speak of His majesty? If <q>the Word made flesh</q> disturbs us, who shall explain <q>In the beginning was the Word</q>? Keep hold then, brethren, upon the entireness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>16. <q>The law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> By a servant was the law given, and made men guilty: by an Emperor was pardon given, and delivered the guilty. <q>The law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q> Let not the servant attribute to himself more than was done through him. Chosen to a great ministry as one faithful in his house, but yet a servant, he is able to act according to the law, but cannot release from the guilt of the law. <q>The law,</q> then, <q>was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>17. And lest, perhaps, any one should say, And did not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> come through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, immediately he adds, <q>No one has seen God at any time.</q> And how did God become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Because the Lord revealed Himself to His servant. What Lord? The same Christ, who sent the law beforehand by His servant, that He might Himself come with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>For no one has seen God at any time.</q> And whence did He appear to that servant as far as he was able to receive Him? But <q>the Only-begotten,</q> he says, <q>who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him.</q> What signifies <q>in the bosom of the Father?</q> In the secret of the Father. For God has not a bosom, as we have, in our garments, nor is He to be thought of sitting, as we do, nor is He girt with a girdle so as to have a bosom; but because our bosom is within, the secret of the Father is called the bosom of the Father. And He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being in the secret of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He declared Him. <q>For no man has seen God at any time.</q> He then came and narrated whatever He saw. What did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> see? <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw a cloud, he saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, he saw a fire. All that is the creature: it bore the type of its Lord, but did not manifest the presence of the Lord Himself. For you have it plainly stated in the law: <q>And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke with the Lord face to face, as a friend with his friend.</q>  Following the same scripture, you find <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saying: <q>If I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, show me Yourself plainly, that I may see You.</q> And it is little that he said this: he received the reply, <q>You can not see my face.</q> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> then spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, my brethren, bearing the type of the Lord; and all those things which were done by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> promised that future <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Those who examine the law well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this; and when we have opportunity to speak somewhat of this matter also, we shall not fail to speak to you, beloved brethren, as far as the Lord may reveal to us.</p>

<p>18. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that all those things which were seen in bodily form were not that substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we saw those things with the eyes of the flesh: how is the substance of God seen? Interrogate the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170064"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> There have been men who, deceived by the vanity of their hearts, have said, The Father is invisible, but the Son is visible. How visible? If on account of His flesh, because He took flesh, the matter is manifest. For of those who saw the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, some crucified; and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> when He was crucified; and unless they had touched the flesh after the resurrection, their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would not have been recalled. If, then, on account of His flesh the Son was visible, that we also grant, and it is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but if before He took flesh, as they say, that is, before He became incarnate, they are greatly deluded, and grievously <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. For those visible and bodily appearances took place though the creature, in which a type might be exhibited: not in any fashion was the substance itself shown and made manifest. Give heed, beloved brethren, to this easy <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. The wisdom of God cannot be beheld by the eyes. Brethren, if Christ is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note170065"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> if Christ is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and if the word of man is not seen with the eyes, can the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> be so seen?</p>

<p>19. Expel, therefore, from your hearts carnal thoughts, that you may be really under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that you may belong to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Therefore is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> promised in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Read the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and see that the same things were enjoined upon a people yet carnal as upon us. For to worship one God is also enjoined upon us. <q>You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain</q> is also enjoined upon us, which is the second commandment. <q>Observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a></q> is enjoined on us more than on them, because it is commanded to be spiritually observed. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in a servile manner, using it for luxuriousness and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>. How much better would their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be employed in spinning wool than in dancing on that day in the balconies? God forbid, brethren, that we should call that an observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> observes the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> spiritually, abstaining from servile work. For what is it to abstain from servile work? From <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And how do we prove it? Ask the Lord. <q>Whosoever commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170066"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> Therefore is the spiritual observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> enjoined upon us. Now all those commandments are more enjoined on us, and are to be observed: <q>You shall not kill. You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>. You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Honor your father and your mother. You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> your neighbor's goods. You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> your neighbor's wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170067"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;20:3-17</a></span> Are not all these things enjoined upon us also? But ask what is the reward, and you will find it there said: <q>That your enemies may be driven forth before your face, and that you may receive the land which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised to your fathers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170068"><a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse1">Leviticus&nbsp;26:1-13</a></span> Because they were not able to comprehend invisible things, they were held by the visible. Wherefore held? Lest they should perish altogether, and slip into idol-worship. For they did this, my brethren, as we read, forgetful of the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> performed before their eyes. The sea was divided; a way was made in the midst of the waves; their enemies following, were covered by the same waves through which they passed: <span class="stiki" id="note170069"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;14:21-31</a></span> and yet when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had departed from their sight, they asked for an idol, and said, <q>Make us gods to go before us; for this man has deserted us.</q> Their whole hope was placed in man, not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Behold, the man is dead: was God dead who had rescued them from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? And when they had made to themselves the image of a calf, they offered it adoration, and said, <q>These be your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which delivered you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170070"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1-4</a></span> How soon forgetful of such manifest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! By what means could such a people be held except by carnal promises?</p>

<p>20. The same things are commanded in the Decalogue as we are commanded to observe; but the same promises are not made as to us. What is promised to us? Life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom You have sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170071"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God is promised: that is, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Brethren, we now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we do not see; for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the reward will be to see what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this, but it was concealed before He came. For a certain lover sighing, says in the Psalms: <q>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after.</q> And do you ask what he seeks? For perhaps he seeks a land flowing with milk and honey carnally, although this is to be spiritually sought and desired; or perhaps the subjection of his enemies, or the death of foes, or the power and riches of this world. For he glows with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and sighs greatly, and burns and pants. Let us see what he desires: <q>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after.</q> What is it that he does seek after? <q>That I may dwell,</q> says he, <q>in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</q> And suppose that you dwell in the house of the Lord, from what source will your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> there be derived? <q>That I may behold,</q> says he, <q>the beauty of the Lord.</q> </p>

<p>21. My brethren, wherefore do you cry out, wherefore do you exult, wherefore do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, unless that a spark of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is there? What do you desire? I ask you. Can it be seen with the eyes? Can it be touched? Is it some fairness which delights the eyes? Are not the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> vehemently beloved; and when we commemorate them do we not burn with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? What is it that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in them, brethren? Limbs torn by wild beasts? What is more revolting if you ask the eyes of the flesh? What more fair if you ask the eyes of the heart? How appears in your eyes a very fair young man who is a thief? How shocked are your eyes! Are the eyes of the flesh shocked? If you interrogate them, nothing is more shapely and better formed than that body; the symmetry of the limbs and the beauty of the color attract the eyes; and yet, when you hear that he is a thief, your mind recoils from the man. You behold on the other hand a bent old man, leaning upon a staff, scarcely moving himself, ploughed all over with wrinkles. You hear that he is just: you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and embracest him. Such are the rewards promised to us, my brethren: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> such, sigh after such a kingdom, desire such a country, if you wish to arrive at that with which our Lord came, that is, at <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But if you <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> bodily rewards from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are still under the law, and therefore you shall not fulfill the law. For when you see those temporal things granted to those who offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your steps falter, and you say to yourself: Behold, I worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, daily I run to church, my knees are worn with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and yet I am constantly sick: there are men who commit murders, who are guilty of robberies, and yet they exult and have abundance; it is well with them. Was it such things that you sought from God? Surely you belonged to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. If, therefore, God gave to you <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because He gave freely, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> freely. Do not for the sake of reward <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let Him be the reward. Let your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> say, <q>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord.</q> Do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that your enjoyment will fail through satiety: such will be that enjoyment of beauty that it will ever be present to you, and you shall never be satisfied; indeed you shall be always satisfied, and yet never satisfied. For if I shall say that you shall not be satisfied, it will mean famine; and if I shall say you shall be satisfied, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> satiety: where neither satiety nor famine are, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to say; but God has that which He can manifest to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to express it, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they shall receive.</p>
