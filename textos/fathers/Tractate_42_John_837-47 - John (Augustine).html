<h1>Tractate 42 (John 8:37-47)</h1>

<p>1. Our Lord, in the form of a servant, yet not a servant, but even in servant-form the Lord (for that form of flesh was indeed servant-like; but though He was <q>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170775"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> yet was He not sinful flesh) promised freedom to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as if proudly glorying in their own freedom, refused with indignation to be made free, when they were the servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And therefore they said that they were free, because <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed. What answer, then, the Lord gave them to this, we have heard in the reading of this day's lesson. <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> He said, <q>that you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children; but you seek to kill me, because my word takes no hold in you.</q> I recognize you, He says; <q>You are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, but you seek to kill me.</q> I recognize the fleshly origin, not the believing heart. <q>You are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> but after the flesh. Therefore He says, <q>You seek to kill me, because my word takes no hold in you.</q> If my word were taken, it would take hold: if you were taken, you would be enclosed like fishes within the meshes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What then means that&mdash; <q>takes no hold in you</q>? It takes not hold of your heart, because not received by your heart. For so is the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so it ought to be to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, as a hook to the fish: it takes when it is taken. No injury is done to those who are taken; since they are taken for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and not for destruction. Hence the Lord says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Come after me, and I shall make you fishers of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170776"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;4:19</a></span> But such were not these; and yet they were the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>&mdash;children of a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unrighteous themselves. For they inherited the fleshly genus, but had become degenerate, by not imitating the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of him whose children they were.</p>

<p>2. You have heard, indeed, the Lord saying, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children.</q> Hear what He says afterwards: <q>I speak that which I have seen with my Father; and you do that which you have seen with your father.</q> He had already said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children.</q> What is it, then, that they do? What He told them: <q>You seek to kill me.</q> This they never saw with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But the Lord wishes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to be understood when He says, <q>I speak that which I have seen with my Father.</q> I have seen the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because I am the Truth. For if the Lord speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which He has seen with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has seen Himself&mdash; He speaks Himself; because He Himself is the Truth of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which He saw with the Father. For He is the Word&mdash; the Word which was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, then, which these men do, and which the Lord chides and reprehends, where have they seen it? With their father. When we come to hear in what follows the still clearer statement who is their father, then shall we understand what kind of things they saw with such a father; for as yet He names not their father. A little above He referred to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, but in regard to their fleshly origin, not their similarity of life. He is about to speak of that other father of theirs, who neither begot them nor created them to be men. But still they were his children in as far as they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not in as far as they were men; in what they imitated him, and not as created by him.</p>

<p>3. <q>They answered and said unto Him, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is our father;</q> as if, What have you to say against <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? Or, If you can, dare to find fault with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Not that the Lord dared not find fault with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; but <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was not one to be found fault with by the Lord, but rather approved. But these men seemed to challenge Him to say some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and so to have some occasion for doing what they purposed. <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is our father.</q></p>

<p>4. Let us hear how the Lord answered them, praising <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to their condemnation. <q>Jesus says unto them, If you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, do the works of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which I have heard of God: this did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> See, he was praised, they were condemned. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was no manslayer. I say not, He implies, I am <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> Lord; though did I say it, I would say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For He said in another place, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I am</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John 8:58</a></span>; and then they sought to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> Him. He said not so. But meanwhile, as you see me, as you look upon me, as alone you think of me, I am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore, then, wish you to kill a man who is telling you what he has heard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because you are not the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? And yet He said above, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children.</q> He does not deny their origin, but condemns their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Their flesh was from him, but not their life.</p>

<p>5. But we, dearly beloved, do we come of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> race, or was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in any sense our father according to the flesh? The flesh of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> draws its origin from his flesh, not so the flesh of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. We have come of other nations, and yet, by imitating him, we have become the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Listen to the apostle: <q>To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed were the promises made. He says not,</q> he adds, <q>And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And if you be Christ's, then are you <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed, and heirs according to the promise.</q>  We then have become <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It was not of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> flesh that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made any co-heirs with him. He disinherited the former, He adopted the latter; and from that olive tree whose root is in the patriarchs, He cut off the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> natural branches, and engrafted the lowly wild olive. <span class="stiki" id="note170778"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;11:17</a></span> And so, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came to John to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he broke out upon them, and addressed them, <q>O generation of vipers.</q> Very greatly indeed did they boast of the loftiness of their origin, but he called them a generation of vipers&mdash;not even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, but of vipers. He saw the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but detected the poison. Yet they had come to be changed,  because at all events to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and he said to them, <q>O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves, We have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to our father; for God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170780"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7-9</a></span> If you bring not forth fruits meet for repentance, flatter not yourselves about such a lineage. God is able to condemn you, without defrauding <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> of children. For He has a way to raise up children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Those who imitate his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be made his children. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> Such are we. In our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> we were stones, when we worshipped stones for our god. Of such stones God has created a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p>6. Why, then, does this empty and vain bragging exalt itself? Let them cease boasting that they are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. They have heard what they ought to have heard: <q>If you are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> prove it by your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, not by words. <q>You seek to kill me, a man;</q>&mdash; I say not, meanwhile, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; I say not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I say not the Word, for the Word dies not. I say merely this that you see; for only what you see can you kill, and whom you see not can you offend. <q>This,</q> then, <q>did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <q>You do the works of your father.</q> And as yet He says not who is that father of theirs.</p>

<p>7. And now what answer did they give Him? For they began somewhat to realize that the Lord was not speaking of carnal generation, but of their manner of life. And because it is the custom of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which they read, to call it, in a spiritual sense, fornication, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, as it were, prostituted by subjection to many false gods, they made this reply: <q>Then said they to Him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</q> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> has now lost his importance. For they were repulsed as they ought to have been by the truth-speaking mouth; because such was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they failed to imitate, and yet gloried in his lineage. And they altered their reply, saying, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, with themselves, As often as we name <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, he goes on to say to us, Why do ye not imitate him in whose lineage ye <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, just, and guileless, we cannot imitate. Let us call God our Father, and see what he will say to us.</p>

<p>8. Has <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> indeed found something to say, and should not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> find its fitting reply? Let us hear what they say: let us hear what they hear. <q>We have one Father,</q> they say, <q>even God. Then said Jesus unto them, If God were your Father, you would [doubtless] <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me; for I proceeded forth and came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither came I of myself, but He sent me.</q> You call God Father; recognize me, then, as at least a brother. At the same time He gave a stimulus to the hearts of the intelligent, by touching on that which He has a habit of saying, <q>I came not of myself: He sent me. I proceeded forth and came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Remember what we are wont to say: From Him He came; and from whom He came, with Him He came. The sending of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, is His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. But as respects the proceeding forth of the Word from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> procession. Time holds not Him by whom time was created. Let no one be saying in his heart, Before the Word was, how did God exist? Never say, Before the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was. God was never without the Word, because the Word is abiding, not transient; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a sound; by whom the heaven and earth were made, and which passed not away with those things that were made upon the earth. From Him, then, He proceeded forth as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the equal, the only Son, the Word of the Father; and came to us, for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> that He might dwell among us. His coming indicates His humanity; His abiding, His divinity. It is His Godhead towards which, His humanity whereby, we make progress. Had He not become that whereby we might advance, we should never attain to Him who abides ever.</p>

<p>9. <q>Why,</q> He says, <q>do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.</q> And so they could not understand, because they could not hear. And whence could they not hear, but just because they refused to be set right by believing? And why so? <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> How long do ye keep speaking of a father? How often will you change your fathers&mdash;at one time <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, at another God? Hear from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> whose children ye be: <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q></p>

<p>10. Here, now, we must beware of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Manicheans, which affirms that there is a certain principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and a certain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of darkness with its princes, which had the presumption to fight against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to let His kingdom be subdued by the hostile <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, dispatched against them, as it were, His own offspring, princes of His own [kingdom of] light; and so subdued that race from which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> derives his origin. From thence, also, they say our flesh derives its origin, and accordingly think the Lord said, <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> because they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as it were, by nature, deriving their origin from the opposing <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of darkness. So they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, so their eyes are blinded, so they make themselves the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of darkness, by believing a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> against Him who created them. For every nature is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but man's nature has been corrupted by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will. What God made cannot be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if man were not [a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of] <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself. But surely the Creator is Creator, and the creature a creature [a thing created]. The creature cannot be put on a level with the Creator. Distinguish between Him who made, and that which He made. The bench cannot be put on a level with the mechanic, nor the pillar with its builder; and yet the mechanic, though he made the bench, did not himself create the wood. But the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His omnipotence and by the Word, made what He made. He had no materials out of which to make all that He made, and yet He made it. For they were made because He willed it, they were made because He said it; but the things made cannot be compared with the Maker. If you seek a proper subject of comparison, turn your mind to the only-begotten Son. How, then, were the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? By imitation, not by birth. Listen to the usual language of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says to those very <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170781"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:3</a></span> The Amorites were not a nation that gave origin to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The Hittites also were themselves of a nation altogether different from the race of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But because the Amorites and Hittites were impious, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> imitated their impieties, they found <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for themselves, not of whom they were born, but in whose damnation they should share, because following their customs. But perhaps you inquire, Whence is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself? From the same source certainly as the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> continued in their obedi ence. He, by disobedience and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, fell as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and became a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>11. But listen now to what the Lord says: <q>You,</q> said He, <q>are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father ye will do.</q> This is how you are his children, because such are your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, not because you are born of him. What are his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>? <q>He was a murderer from the beginning.</q> This it is that explains, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father ye will do.</q> <q>You seek to kill me, a man that tells you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> He, too, had ill-will to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and slew man. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in his ill-will to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, assuming the guise of a serpent, spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> instilled his poison into the man. They died by listening to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note170782"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;3:1</a></span> whom they would not have listened to had they but listened to the Lord; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, having his place between Him who created and him who was fallen, ought to have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the Creator, not the deceiver. Therefore <q>he was a murderer from the beginning.</q> Look at the kind of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, brethren. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is called a murderer not as armed with a sword, or girded with steel. He came to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, sowed his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suggestions, and slew him. Think not, then, that you are not a murderer when you persuade your brother to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If you persuade your brother to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you slay him. And to let you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you slay him, listen to the psalm: <q>The sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</q>  You, then, <q>will do the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father;</q> and so ye go madly after the flesh, because ye cannot go after the spirit. <q>He was a murderer from the beginning;</q> at least in the case of the first of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. From the very time that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> [manslaughter] could possibly be committed, <em>he</em> was a murderer [manslayer]. Only from the time that man was made could manslaughter be committed. For man could not be slain unless man was previously made. Therefore, <q> <em>he</em> was a murderer from the beginning.</q> And whence a murderer? <q>And he stood [abode] not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Therefore he was in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and fell by not standing in it. And why <q>stood he not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q>? <q>Because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him;</q> not as in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In such a way is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> [in Him], that Christ Himself <em>is</em> the Truth. If, then, he had stood in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he would have stood in Christ; but <q>he abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him.</q></p>

<p>12. <q>When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</q>  What is this? You have heard the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: you have received them with attention. Here now, I repeat them, that you may clearly understand the subject of your thoughts. The Lord said those things of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> which ought to have been said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by the Lord. That <q>he was a murderer from the beginning</q> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for he slew the first man; <q>and he abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> for he lapsed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>,</q> to wit, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, <q>he speaks of his own;</q> for he is a liar, and its [his] father. From these words some have thought that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has a father, and have inquired who was the father of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Indeed this detestable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Manicheans has found means down to this present time wherewith to deceive the simple. For they are wont to say, Suppose that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and fell; and with him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> began as you say; but, Who was his father? We, on the contrary, reply, Who of us ever said that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had a father? And they, on the other hand, rejoin, The Lord says, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> declares, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <q>He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him. When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and <em> his</em> father.</q></p>

<p>13. Hear and understand. I shall not send you far away [for the meaning]; understand it from the words themselves. The Lord called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the father of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. What is this? Hear what it is, only revolve the words themselves, and understand. It is not every one who tells a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> that is the father of his lie. For if you have got a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> from another, and uttered it, thou indeed hast lied in giving utterance to the lie; but you are not the father of that lie, because you have got it from another. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was a liar of himself. He begot his own <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; he heard it from no one. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father begot as His Son the Truth, so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, having fallen, begot <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> as his son. Hearing this, recall now and reflect upon the words of the Lord. You catholic minds, consider what you have heard; attend to what He says. <q>He</q>&mdash; who? The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash; <q>was a murderer from the beginning.</q> We admit it&mdash;he slew Adam. <q>And he abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> We admit it, for he lapsed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him.</q> True: by falling away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he has lost its possession. <q>When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</q> He is both a liar, and the father of lies. For thou, it may be, are a liar, because you utter a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; but you are not its father. For if you have got what you say from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, you are a liar, but not the father of the lie. But he, because he got not elsewhere the lie wherewith in serpent-form he slew man as if by poison, is the father of lies just as God is Father of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Withdraw, then, from the father of lies: make haste to the Father of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; embrace the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that you may enter into liberty.</p>

<p>14. Those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, then, spoke what they saw with their father. And what was that but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? But the Lord saw with His Father what He should speak; and what was that, but Himself? What, but the Word of the Father? What, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> itself, and co-eternal with the Father? He, then, <q>was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him; when he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar,</q>&mdash; and not only a liar, but also <q>the father of it;</q> that is, of the very lie that he speaks he is the father, for he himself begot his lie. <q>And because <em>I</em> tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not. Which of you convicts me of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> as I convict both you and your father? <q>If I say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, why do ye not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me,</q> but just because you are the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</p>

<p>15. <q>He that is of God hears God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Here, again, it is not of their nature as men, but of their depravity, that you are to think. In this way they are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By nature they are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in depravity they are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Give heed, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you. In the gospel you have the remedy against the poisonous and impious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For of these words also the Manicheans are accustomed to say, See, here there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, &mdash; the one good and the other bad; the Lord says it. What says the Lord? <q>You therefore hear me not, because you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> This is what the Lord says. What then, he rejoins, do you say to that? Hear what I say. They are both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By nature they are of God: by depravity they are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the good nature which is of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> voluntarily by believing the persuasive words of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and was corrupted; and so it is seeking a physician, because no longer in health. That is what I say. But you think it impossible that they should be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hear why it is not impossible. They are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the same way as they are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and yet not the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Here you have it. It is not as you say. Hearken to the Lord Himself; it is He that said to them, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> Could there be any lie with the Lord? Surely not. Then is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what the Lord said? It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Then it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they were the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But listen to Himself denying it. He who said, <q>You are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> Himself denied that they were the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <q>If you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, do the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that tells you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which I have heard from God: this did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. You do the works of your father,</q> that is, of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. How, then, were they both <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, and yet not his children? Both states He showed in them. They were both <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children in their carnal origin, and not his children in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of following the persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. So, also, apply it to our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they were both of Him, and not of Him. How were they of Him? Because He it was that created the man of whom they were born. How were they of Him? Because He is the Architect of nature,&mdash; Himself the Creator of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. How, then, were they not of Him? Because they had made themselves depraved. They were no longer of Him, because, imitating the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, they had become the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>16. Therefore came the Lord God to man as a sinner. You have heard the two names, both <em>man</em> and <em> sinner</em>. As man, he is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as a sinner, he is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let the moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  in man be distinguished from his nature. Let that nature be owned, to the praise of the Creator; let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be acknowledged, that the physician may be called in to its cure. When the Lord then said, <q>He that is of God hears the words of God: ye therefore hear them not, because you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> He did not distinguish the value of different natures, or find, beyond their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, any nature in men which had not been vitiated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but foreknowing those who should yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, them He called <em>of God</em>, because yet to be born again of God by the adoption of regeneration. To these apply the words <q>He that is of God hears the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> But that which follows, <q>You therefore hear them not, because you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> was said to those who were not only corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (for this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was common to all), but also foreknown as those who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that alone could deliver them from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On this account He foreknew that those to whom He so spoke would continue in that which they derived from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that is, in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and would die in the impiety in which they resembled him; and would not come to the regeneration wherein they would be the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, be born of the God by whom they were created as men. In accordance with this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> purpose did the Lord speak; and not that He had found any man among them who either by regeneration was already of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or by nature was no longer of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
