<h1>Tractate 57 (John 13:6-10, SONG OF SOLOMON 5:2-3)</h1>

<p>In what way the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to defile her feet, while proceeding on her way to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>1. I Have not been unmindful of my debt, and acknowledge that the time of payment has now come. May He give me wherewith to pay, as He gave me <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to incur the debt. For He has given me the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of which it is said, <q>Owe no man anything, but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171145"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;13:8</a></span> May He give also the word, which I feel myself owing to those I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. I put off your expectations till now for this reason, that I might explain as I could how it is we come to Christ along the ground, when we are commanded rather to seek the things which are above, not the things which are upon the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note171146"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> For Christ is sitting above, at the right hand of the Father: but He is assuredly here also; and for that reason said also to Saul, as he was raging on the earth, <q>Why do you persecute me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171147"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> But the topic on which we were speaking, and which led to our entering on this inquiry, was our Lord's washing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, after the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> themselves had already been washed, and needed not, save to wash their feet. And we there saw it to be understood that a man is indeed wholly washed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; but while thereafter he lives in this present world, and with the feet of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> treads on this earth, that is, in his life-intercourse with others, he contracts enough to call forth the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Forgive us our debts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171148"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> And thus from these also is he cleansed by Him who washed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet,  and ceases not to make intercession for us. <span class="stiki" id="note171150"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;8:34</a></span> And here occurred the words of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Song of Songs, when she says, <q>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> when she wished to go and open to that Being, fairer in form than the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,  who had come to her and knocked, and asked her to open to Him. This gave rise to a question, which we were unwilling to compress into the narrow limits of the time, and therefore deferred till now, in what sense the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when on her way to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, may be afraid of defiling her feet, which she had washed in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. For thus she speaks: <q>I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my Beloved  that knocks at the gate.</q> And then He also says: <q>Open to me, my sister, my nearest, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night.</q> And she replies: <q>I have put off my dress; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171153"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:2-3</a></span> O wonderful sacramental <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>! O lofty <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! Does she, then, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to defile her feet in coming to Him who washed the feet of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? Her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is genuine; for it is along the earth she has to come to Him, who is still on earth, because refusing to leave His own who are stationed here. Is it not He that says, <q>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note171154"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> Is it not He that says, <q>You shall see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a></q>?  If they ascend to Him because He is above, how do they descend to Him, but because He is also here? Therefore says the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: <q>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> She says so even in the case of those who, purified from all dross, can say: <q>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ; nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171156"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23-24</a></span> She says it in those who preach Christ, and open to Him the door, that He may dwell by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the hearts of men. <span class="stiki" id="note171157"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> In such she says it, when they deliberate whether to undertake such a ministry, for which they do not consider themselves qualified, so as to discharge it blamelessly, and so as not, after preaching to others, themselves to become castaways. <span class="stiki" id="note171158"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:27</a></span> For it is safer to hear than to preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for in the hearing, humility is preserved; but when it is preached, it is scarcely possible for any man to hinder the entrance of some small measure of boasting, whereby the feet at least are defiled.</p>

<p>3. Therefore, as the Apostle James says, <q>Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171159"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;1:19</a></span> As it is also said by another man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>You will make me to hear <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; and the bones You have humbled will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q>  This is what I said: When the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is heard, humility is preserved. And another says: <q>But the friend of the bridegroom stands and hears him, and rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.</q>  Let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the hearing that comes from the noiseless speaking of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> within us. For although, when the sound is outwardly uttered, as by one that reads; or proclaims, or preaches, or disputes, or commands, or comforts, or exhorts, or even by one that sings or accompanies his voice on an instrument, those who do so may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to defile their feet, when they aim at pleasing men with the secretly active desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> applause. Yet the one who hears such with a willing and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, has no room for self-gratulation in the labors of others; and with no self-inflation, but with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of humility, rejoices because of the Master's words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Accordingly, in those who hear with willingness and humility, and spend a tranquil life in sweet and wholesome studies, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church will take delight, and may say, <q>I sleep, and my heart wakes.</q> And what is this, <q>I sleep, and my heart wakes,</q> but just I sit down quietly to listen? My leisure is not laid out in nourishing slothfulness, but in acquiring wisdom. <q>I sleep, and my heart wakes.</q> I am still, and see that You are the Lord:  for <q>the wisdom of the scribe comes by opportunity of leisure; and he that has little business shall become wise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171163"><a href="../bible/sir038.htm#verse24">Sirach&nbsp;38:24</a></span> <q>I sleep, and my heart wakes:</q> I rest from troublesome business, and my mind turns its attention to divine concerns (<em>or</em> communications). </p>

<p>4. But while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> finds delightful repose in those who thus sweetly and humbly sit at her feet, here is one who knocks, and says: <q>What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171165"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;10:27</a></span> It is His voice, then, that knocks at the gate, and says: <q>Open to me, my sister, my neighbor, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</q> As if He had said, You are at leisure, and the door is closed against me: you are caring for the leisure of the few, and through abounding iniquity the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many is waxing cold. <span class="stiki" id="note171166"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> The night He speaks of is iniquity: but His dew and drops are those who wax cold and fall away, and make the head of Christ to wax cold, that is, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God to fail. For the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note171167"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> But they are borne on His locks, that is, their presence is tolerated in the visible <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; while their senses never take hold of the internal realities. He knocks, therefore, to shake off this quiet from His inactive <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and cries, <q>Open to me,</q> thou who, through my blood, has become <q>my sister;</q> through my drawing near, <q>my neighbor;</q> through my Spirit, <q>my dove;</q> through my word which you have fully learned in your leisure, <q>my perfect one:</q> open to me, go and preach me to others. For how shall I get in to those who have shut their door against me, without some one to open? And how shall they hear without a preacher? <span class="stiki" id="note171168"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;10:14</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Hence it happens that those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to devote their leisure to good studies, and shrink from encountering the troubles of toilsome labors, as feeling themselves unsuited to undertake and discharge such services with credit, would prefer, were it possible, to have the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancient preachers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> again raised up against that abounding of iniquity which has so reduced the warmth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But in regard to those who have already left the body, and put off the garment of the flesh (for they are not utterly parted), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> replies, <q>I have put off my dress; how shall I put it on?</q> That dress shall, indeed, yet be recovered; and in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those who have meanwhile laid it aside, shall the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again put on the garment of flesh: only not now, when the cold are needing to be warmed; but then, when the dead shall rise again. Realizing, then, her present difficulty through the scarcity of preachers, and remembering those members of her own who were so sound in word and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in character, but are now disunited from their bodies, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> says in her sorrow, <q>I have put off my dress; how shall I put it on?</q> How can those members of mine, who had such surpassing power, through their preaching, to open the door to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, now return to the bodies which they have laid aside?</p>

<p>6. And then, turning again to those who preach, and gather in and govern the congregations of His people, and so open as they can to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but are afraid, amid the difficulties of such work, of falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, she says, <q>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> For whosoever offends not in word, the same is a perfect man. And who, then, is perfect? Who is there that offends not amid such an abounding of iniquity, and such a freezing of charity? <q>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> At times I read and hear: <q>My brethren, be not many masters, seeing that you shall receive the greater condemnation: for in many things we offend all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171169"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse1">James&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> <q>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> But see, I rise and open. Christ, wash them. <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> because our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is not altogether extinguished: for <q>we also forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171170"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> When we listen to You, the bones which have been humbled <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with You in the heavenly places.  But when we preach You, we have to tread the ground in order to open to You: and then, if we are blameworthy, we are troubled; if we are commended, we become inflated. Wash our feet, that were formerly cleansed, but have again been defiled in our walking through the earth to open unto You. Let this be enough today, beloved. But in whatever we have happened to offend, by saying otherwise than we ought, or have been unduly elated by your commendations, entreat that our feet may be washed, and may your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> find acceptance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
