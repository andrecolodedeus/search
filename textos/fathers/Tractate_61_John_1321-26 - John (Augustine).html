<h1>Tractate 61 (John 13:21-26)</h1>

<p>1. This short section of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, brethren, we have in this lesson brought forward for exposition, as thinking that we ought also to say something of the Lord's betrayer, as now plainly enough disclosed by the dipping and holding out to him of the piece of bread. Of that indeed which precedes, (namely), that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when about to point him out, was troubled in spirit, we have treated in our last discourse; but what I perhaps omitted to mention there, the Lord, by His own perturbation of spirit, thought proper to indicate this also, that it is necessary to bear with false brethren, and those tares that are among the wheat in the Lord's field until harvest-time, because that when we are compelled by urgent reasons to separate some of them even before the harvest, it cannot be done without disturbance to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such disturbance to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the future, through schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the Lord in a way foretold and prefigured in Himself, when, at the moment of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man Judas' departure, and of his thereby bringing to an end, in a very open and decided way, his past intermingling with the wheat, in which he had long been tolerated, He was troubled, not in body, but in spirit. For it is not spitefulness, but charity, that troubles His spiritual members in scandals of this kind; lest perchance, in separating some of the tares, any of the wheat should also be uprooted therewith.</p>

<p>2. <q>Jesus,</q> therefore, <q>was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said: Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</q> <q>One of you,</q> in number, not in merit; in appearance, not in reality; in bodily commingling, not by any spiritual tie; a companion by fleshly juxtaposition, not in any unity of the heart; and therefore not one who is of you, but one who is to go forth from you. For how else can this <q>one of you</q> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, of which the Lord so testified, and said, if that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which the writer of this very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says in his Epistle, <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note171202"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> Judas, therefore was not of them; for, had he been of them, he would have continued with them. What, then, do the words <q>One of you shall betray me</q> mean, but that one is going out from you who shall betray me? Just as he also, who said, <q>If they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us,</q> had said before, <q>They went out from us.</q> And thus it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in both senses, <q>of us,</q> and <q>not of us;</q> in one respect <q>of us,</q> and in another <q>not of us;</q> <q>of us</q> in respect to sacramental communion, but <q>not of us</q> in respect to the criminal conduct that belongs exclusively to themselves.</p>

<p>3. <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> looked one on another, doubting of whom He spoke.</q> For while they were imbued with a reverential <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to their Master, they were none the less affected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity in their feelings towards each other. Each one's own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to himself; but as he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his neighbor's, each one's self-assurance was such that each was uncertain of all the others, and all the others were uncertain of that one.</p>

<p>4. <q>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom, one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom Jesus loved.</q> What he meant by saying <q>in His bosom,</q> he tells us a little further on, where he says, <q>on the breast of Jesus.</q> It was that very John whose <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is before us, as he afterwards expressly declares.  For it was a custom with those who have supplied us with the sacred writings, that when any of them was relating the divine history, and came to something affecting himself, he spoke as if it were about another; and gave himself a place in the line of his narrative becoming one who was the recorder of public events, and not as one who made himself the subject of his preaching. Saint Matthew acted also in this way, when, in coming in the course of his narrative to himself, he says, <q>He saw a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and says unto him, Follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171204"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;9:9</a></span> He does not say, He saw <em>me</em>, and said to <em>me</em>. So also acted the blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, writing all the history about himself as if it concerned another, and saying, <q>The Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171205"><a href="../bible/exo006.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;6:1</a></span> Less <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> was this done by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, not however in any history which undertakes to explain the course of public events, but in his own epistles. At all events, he speaks thus of himself: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>;) such an one caught up into the third heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171206"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2</a></span> And so, when the blessed <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> also says here, not, I was leaning on Jesus' bosom, but, <q>There was leaning one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> let us recognize a custom of our author's, rather than fall into any wonder on the subject. For what loss is there to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when the facts themselves are told us, and all boastfulness of language is in a measure avoided? For thus at least did he relate that which most signally pertained to his praise.</p>

<p>5. But what mean the words, <q>whom Jesus loved</q>? As if He did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the others, of whom this same John has said above, <q>He loved them to the end</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John 13:1</a></span>; and as the Lord Himself, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> And who could enumerate all the testimonies of the sacred pages, in which the Lord Jesus is exhibited as the lover, not only of this one, or of those who were then around Him, but of such also as were to be His members in the distant future, and of His universal Church? But there is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, doubtless, underlying these words, and having reference to the bosom on which the narrator was leaning. For what else can be in dicated by the <em>bosom</em> but some hidden <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? But there is another more suitable passage, where the Lord may enable us to say something about this secret that may prove sufficient.</p>

<p>6. <q><a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> therefore beckons, and says to him.</q>  The expression is noteworthy, as indicating that something was said not by any sound of words, but by merely beckoning with the head. <q>He beckons, and says;</q> that is, his beckoning is his speech. For if one is said to speak in his thoughts, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>They said [reasoned] with themselves;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171208"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;2:1</a></span> how much more may he do so by beckoning, which expresses outwardly by some sort of signs what had previously been conceived within! What, then, did his beckoning mean? What else but that which follows? <q>Who is it of whom He speaks?</q> Such was the language of Peter's beckoning; for it was by no vocal sounds, but by bodily gestures, that he spoke. <q>He then, having leaned back on Jesus' breast,</q>&mdash; surely the very bosom  of His breast this, the secret place of wisdom!&mdash; <q>says unto Him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a piece of bread, when I have dipped it. And when He had dipped the bread, he gave it to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, the son of Simon. And after the bread, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into him.</q> The traitor was disclosed, the coverts of darkness were revealed. What he got was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to his own hurt he received it, because, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> himself, in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit he received what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But we have much to say about that dipped bread which was presented to the false-hearted <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and about that which follows; and for these we shall require more time than remains to us now at the close of this discourse.</p>
