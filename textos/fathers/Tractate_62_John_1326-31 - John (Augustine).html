<h1>Tractate 62 (John 13:26-31)</h1>

<p>1. I Know, dearly beloved, that some may be moved, as the godly to inquire into the meaning of, and the ungodly to find fault with, the statement, that it was after the Lord had given the bread, that had been dipped, to His betrayer that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into him. For so it is written: <q>And when He had dipped the bread, He gave it to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, the Son of Simon. And after the bread, then entered <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> into him.</q> For they say, Was this the worth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bread, given from Christ's own table, that after it <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> should enter into His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>? And the answer we give them is, that thereby we are taught rather how much we need to beware of receiving what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a sinful spirit. For the point of special importance is, not the thing that is received, but the person that receives it; and not the character of the thing that is given, but of him to whom it is given. For even <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are hurtful, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are beneficial, according to the character of the recipients. <q>Sin,</q> says the apostle, <q>that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wrought death to me by that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171210"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;7:13</a></span> Thus, you see, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is brought about by the good, so long as that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is wrongly received. It is he also that says: <q>Lest I should be exalted unduly through the greatness of my revelations, there was given to me a thorn in my flesh, the messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me. For which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He would take it away from me; and He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you: for strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171211"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> And here, you see, good was brought about by that which was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was received in a good spirit. Why, then, do we wonder if Christ's bread was given to Judas, that thereby he should be made over to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; when we see, on the other hand, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was visited by a messenger of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that by such an instrumentality he might be perfected in Christ? In this way, both the good was injurious to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was beneficial to the good. Bear in mind the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>Whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171212"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27</a></span> And when the apostle said this, he was dealing with those who were taking the body of the Lord, like any other food, in an undiscerning and careless spirit. If, then, he is thus taken to task who does not discern, that is, does not distinguish from the other kinds of food, the body of the Lord, what condemnation must be his, who in the guise of a friend comes as an enemy to His table! If negligence in the guest is thus visited with blame, what must be the punishment that will fall on the man that sells the very person who has invited him to his table! And why was the bread given to the traitor, but as an evidence of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he had treated with ingratitude?</p>

<p>2. It was after this bread, then, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into the Lord's betrayer, that, as now given over to his power, he might take full possession of one into whom before this he had only entered in order to lead him into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For we are not to suppose that he was not in him when he went to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and bargained about the price of betraying the Lord; for the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Luke very plainly attests this when he says: <q>Then entered <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, being one of the twelve; and he went his way, and communed with the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171213"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;22:3-4</a></span> Here, you see, it is shown that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had already entered into Judas. His first entrance, therefore, was when he implanted in his heart the thought of betraying Christ; for in such a spirit had he already come to the supper. But now, after the bread, he entered into him, no longer to tempt one who belonged to another, but to take possession of him as his own.</p>

<p>3. But it was not then, as some thoughtless readers suppose, that Judas received the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For we are to understand that the Lord had already dispensed to all of them the sacrament of His body and blood, when Judas also was present, as very clearly related by Saint Luke; <span class="stiki" id="note171214"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;22:19-21</a></span> and it was after this that we come to the moment when, in accordance with John's account, the Lord made a full disclosure of His betrayer by dipping and holding out to him the morsel of bread, and intimating perhaps by the dipping of the bread the false pretensions of the other. For the dipping of a thing does not always imply its washing; but some things are dipped in order to be dyed. But if a good meaning is to be here attached to the dipping, his ingratitude for that good was deservedly followed by damnation.</p>

<p>4. But still, possessed as Judas now was, not by the Lord, but by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and now that the bread had entered the belly, and an enemy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this man of ingratitude: still, I say, there was this enormous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, already conceived in his heart, waiting to be wrought out to its full issue, for which the damnable desire had always preceded. Accordingly, when the Lord, the living Bread, had given this bread to the dead, and in giving it had revealed the betrayer of the Bread, He said, <q>What you do, do quickly.</q> He did not command the crime, but foretold <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to Judas, and good to us. For what could be worse for Judas, or what could be better for us, than the delivering up of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;a deed done by him to his own destruction, but done, apart from him, in our behalf? <q>What you do, do quickly.</q> Oh that word of One whose wish was to be ready rather than to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>! That word! expressing not so much the punishment of the traitor as the reward awaiting the Redeemer! For He said, <q>What you do, do quickly,</q> not as wrathfully looking to the destruction of the trust-betrayer, but in His own haste to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; for He was delivered for our offenses, <span class="stiki" id="note171215"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> and He loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gave Himself for it. <span class="stiki" id="note171216"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> And as the apostle also says of himself: <q>Who loved me, and gave Himself for me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171217"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> Had not, then, Christ given Himself, no one could have given Him up. What is there in Judas' conduct but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For in delivering up Christ he had no thought of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for which Christ was really delivered, but thought only of his money gain, and found the loss of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He got the wages he wished, but had also given him, against his wish, the wages he merited. Judas delivered up Christ, Christ delivered Himself up: the former transacted the business of his own selling of his Master, the latter the business of our redemption. <q>What you do, do quickly,</q> not because you have the power in yourself, but because He wills it who has all the power.</p>

<p>5. <q>Now no one of those at the table <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> for what intent He spoke this unto him. For some of them thought, because Judas had the money-bag, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said unto him, Buy those things which we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</q> The Lord, therefore, had also a money-box, where He kept the offerings of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and distributed to the necessities of His own, and to others who were in need. It was then that the custom of having church-money was first introduced, so that thereby we might understand that His precept about taking no thought for the morrow <span class="stiki" id="note171218"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;6:34</a></span> was not a command that no money should be kept by His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be served for any such end, and that the doing of what is right should not be held in abeyance through the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of want. For the apostle also has this foresight for the future, when he says: <q>If any believer has <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, let him give them enough, that the church may not be burdened, that it may have enough for them that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171219"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:16</a></span> </p>

<p>6. <q>He then, having received the morsel of bread, went immediately out: and it was night.</q> And he that went out was himself the night. <q>Therefore when</q> the night <q>had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> The day therefore uttered speech unto the day, that is, Christ did so to His faithful <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they might hear and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as His followers; and the night showed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> unto the night,  that is, Judas did so to the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that they might come as His persecutors, and make Him their prisoner. But now, in considering these words of the Lord, which were addressed to the godly, before His arrest by the ungodly, special attention on the part of the hearer is required; and therefore it will be more becoming in the preacher, instead of hurriedly considering them now, to defer them till a future occasion.</p>
