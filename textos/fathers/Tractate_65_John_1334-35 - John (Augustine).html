<h1>Tractate 65 (John 13:34-35)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord Jesus declares that He is giving His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> a new commandment, that they should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. <q>A new commandment,</q> He says, <q>I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> But was not this already commanded in the ancient law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where it is written, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note171236"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus&nbsp;19:18</a></span> Why, then, is it called a new one by the Lord, when it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so old? Is it on this account a new commandment, because He has divested us of the old, and clothed us with the new man? For it is not indeed every kind of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that renews him that listens to it, or rather yields it <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> regarding which the Lord, in order to distinguish it from all carnal affection, added, <q>as I have loved you.</q> For husbands and wives <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children, and all other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> relationships that bind men together: to say nothing of the blame-worthy and damnable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is mutually felt by adulterers and adulteresses, by fornicators and prostitutes, and all others who are knit together by no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> relationship, but by the mischievous depravity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Christ, therefore, has given us a new commandment, that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as He also has loved us. This is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that renews us, making us new men, heirs of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, singers of the new song. It was this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, brethren beloved, that renewed also those of olden time, who were then the righteous, the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as it did afterwards the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: it is it, too, that is now renewing the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and from among the universal race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which overspreads the whole world, is making and gathering together a new people, the body of the newly-married spouse of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of whom it is said in the Song of Songs, <q>Who is she that ascends, made white?</q>  Made white indeed, because renewed; and how, but by the new commandment? Because of this, the members thereof have a mutual interest in one another; and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and one member be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, all the members <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with it. <span class="stiki" id="note171238"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:25-26</a></span> For this they hear and observe, <q>A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another:</q> not as those <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another who are corrupters, nor as men <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> way; but they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another as those who are gods, and all of them sons of the Highest, and brethren, therefore, of His only Son, with that mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He loved them, when about to lead them on to the goal where all sufficiency should be theirs, and where their every desire should be satisfied with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.  For then there will be nothing wanting they can desire, when God will be all in all. <span class="stiki" id="note171240"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> An end like that has no end. No one dies there, where no one arrives save he that dies to this world, not that universal kind of death whereby the body is bereft of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but the death of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, through which, even while still remaining in this mortal flesh, the heart is set on the things which are above. Of such a death it is that the apostle said, <q>For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171241"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> And perhaps to this, also, do the words refer, <q>Love is strong as death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171242"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:6</a></span> For by this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it is brought about, that, while still held in the present corruptible body, we die to this world, and our life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yea, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself is our death to the world, and our life with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if that is death when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quits the body, how can it be other than death when our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> quits the world? Such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, therefore, is strong as death. And what is stronger than that which binds the world?</p>

<p>2. Think not then, my brethren, that when the Lord says, <q>A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another,</q> there is any overlooking of that greater commandment, which requires us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all our mind; for along with this seeming oversight, the words <q>that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another</q> appear also as if they had no reference to that second commandment, which says, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself.</q> For <q>on these two commandments,</q> He says, <q>hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171243"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37-40</a></span> But both commandments may be found in each of these by those who have good understanding. For, on the one hand, he that loves God cannot despise His commandment to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbor; and on the other, he who in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual way loves his neighbor, what does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in him but God? That is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, distinguished from all mundane <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which the Lord specially characterized, when He added, <q>as I have loved you.</q> For what was it but God that He loved in us? Not because we had Him, but in order that we might have Him; and that He may lead us on, as I said a little ago, where God is all in all. It is in this way, also, that the physician is properly said to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sick; and what is it he loves in them but their health, which at all events he desires to recall; not their sickness, which he comes to remove? Let us, then, also so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, that, as far as possible, we may by the solicitude of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be winning one another to have God within us. And this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is bestowed on us by Him who said, <q>As I have loved you, that you also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> For this very end, therefore, did He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, that we also should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; bestowing this on us by His own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us, that we should be bound to one another in mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and, united together as members by so pleasant a bond, should be the body of so mighty a Head.</p>

<p>3. <q>By this,</q> He adds, <q>Shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another:</q> as if He said, Other gifts of mine are possessed in common with you by those who are not mine&mdash;not only nature, life, perception, reason, and that safety which is equally the privilege of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and beasts; but also languages, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the bestowing of their goods upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the giving of their body to the flames: but because destitute of charity, they only tinkle like cymbals; they are nothing, and by nothing are they profited. <span class="stiki" id="note171244"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> It is not, then, by such gifts of mine, however good, which may be alike possessed by those who are not my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but <q>by this it is that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another.</q> O thou spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, fair among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>! O thou who ascendest in whiteness, leaning upon your Beloved! For by His light you are made dazzling to whiteness, by His assistance you are preserved from falling. How well becoming you are the words in that Song of Songs, which is, as it were, your bridal chant, <q>That there is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in your delights</q>!  This it is that suffers not your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to perish with the ungodly; it is this that judges your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and is strong as death, and is present in your delights. How wonderful is the character of that death, which was all but swallowed up in penal sufferings, had it not been over and above absorbed in delights! But here this discourse must now be closed; for we must make a new commencement in dealing with the words that follow.</p>
