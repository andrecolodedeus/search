<h1>Tractate 67 (John 14:1-3)</h1>

<p>1. Our special attention, brethren, must be earnestly turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that we may be able to obtain some intelligent apprehension of the words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which have just been ringing in our ears. For the Lord Jesus says: <q>Let not your heart be troubled. Believe  in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> [<em>or</em>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also] in me.</q> That they might not as men be afraid of death, and so be troubled, He comforts them by affirming Himself also to be God. <q>Believe,</q> He says, <q>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in me.</q> For it follows as a consequence, that if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in me: which were no consequence if Christ were not God. <q>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in</q> Him, who, by nature and not by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, is equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He emptied Himself; not, however, by losing the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by taking the form of a servant. <span class="stiki" id="note171253"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> You are afraid of death as regards this servant form, <q>let not your heart be troubled,</q> the form of God will raise it again.</p>

<p>2. But why have we this that follows, <q>In my Father's house are many mansions,</q> but that they were also in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> about themselves? And therein they might have heard the words, <q>Let not your heart be troubled.</q> For, was there any of them that could be free from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when Peter, the most confident and forward of them all, was told, <q>The cock shall not crow till you have denied me thrice</q>?  Considering themselves, therefore, beginning with Peter, as destined to perish, they had <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be troubled: but when they now hear, <q>In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you,</q> they are revived from their trouble, made certain and confident that after all the perils of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> they shall dwell with Christ in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, albeit one is stronger than another, one wiser than another, one more righteous than another, <q>in the Father's house there are many mansions;</q> none of them shall remain outside that house, where every one, according to his deserts, is to receive a mansion. All alike have that penny, which the householder orders to be given to all that have wrought in the vineyard, making no distinction therein between those who have labored less and those who have labored more: <span class="stiki" id="note171255"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;20:9</a></span> by which penny, of course, is signified <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, whereto no one any longer lives to a different length than others, since in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> life has no diversity in its measure. But the many mansions point to the different grades of merit in that one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. For there is one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun, another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the moon, and another <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the stars: for one star differs from another star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and so also the resurrection of the dead. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, like the stars in the sky, obtain in the kingdom different mansions of diverse degrees of brightness; but on account of that one penny no one is cut off from the kingdom; and God will be all in all  in such a way, that, as God is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note171257"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:8</a></span> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> will bring it about that what is possessed by each will be common to all. For in this way every one really possesses it, when he loves to see in another what he has not himself. There will not, therefore, be any envying amid this diversity of brightness, since in all of them will be reigning the unity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>3. Every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heart, therefore, must utterly reject the idea of those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that there are many mansions spoken of, because there will be some place outside the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which shall be the abode of those blessed innocents who have departed this life without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because without it they cannot enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Faith like this is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, inasmuch as it is not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Are you not so foolish and blinded with carnal imaginations as to be worthy of reprobation, if you should thus separate the mansion, I say not of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or any of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but even of any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infant from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; do you not think yourselves deserving of reprobation in thus putting a separation between these and the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father? For the Lord's words are not, In the whole world, or, In all creation, or, In everlasting life and blessedness, there are many mansions; but He says, <q>In my Father's house are many mansions.</q> Is not that the house where we have a building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens? <span class="stiki" id="note171258"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:1</a></span> Is not that the house whereof we sing to the Lord, <q>Blessed are they that dwell in Your house; they shall praise You for ever and ever</q>?  Will you then venture to separate from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> the house, not of every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> brother, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Himself, to whom all we who are brethren say, <q>Our Father, who art in heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171260"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;6:9</a></span> or divide it in such a way as to make some of its mansions inside, and some outside, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>? Far, far be it from those who desire to dwell in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, to be willing to dwell in such folly with you: far be it, I say, that since every house of sons that are reigning can be nowhere else but in the kingdom, any part of the royal house itself should be outside the kingdom.</p>

<p>4. <q>And if I go,</q> He says, <q>and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the way ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> O Lord Jesus, how can You go to prepare a place, if there are already many mansions in Your Father's house, where Your people shall dwell with Yourself? Or if Thou receive them unto Yourself, how will You come again, who never withdrawest Your presence? Such subjects as these, beloved, were we to attempt to explain them with such brevity as seems within the proper bounds of our discourse today, would certainly suffer in clearness from compression, and the very brevity would become itself a second obscurity; we shall therefore defer this debt, which the bounty of our Family-head will enable us to repay at a more suitable opportunity.</p>
