<h1>Tractate 70 (John 14:7-10)</h1>

<p>1. The words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, brethren, are rightly understood only if they are found to be in harmony with those that precede; for the premises ought to agree with the conclusion, when it is the Truth that speaks. The Lord had said before, <q>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also:</q> and then had added, <q>And whither I go ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the way ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>;</q> and showed that all He said was that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Himself. What, therefore, the meaning was of His going to Himself by Himself&mdash;for He also lets the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> see that it is by Him that they are to come to Him&mdash;we have already told you, as we could, in our last discourse. When He says, therefore, <q>That where I am, there ye may be also,</q> where else were they to be but in Himself? In this way is He also in Himself, and they, therefore, are just where He is, that is, in Himself. Accordingly, He Himself is that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which is yet to be ours, when He has received us unto Himself; and as He is that life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, so is it in Him, that where He is there shall we be also, that is to say, in Himself. <q>For as the Father has life in Himself,</q> and certainly that life which He has is in no wise different from what He is Himself as its possessor, <q>so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself,</q>  inasmuch as He is the very life which He has in Himself. But shall we then actually be what He is, (namely), the life, when we shall have begun our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in that life, that is, in Himself? Certainly not, for He, by His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as the life, has life, and is Himself what He has; and as the life, is in Him, so is He in Himself: but we are not that life, but partakers of His life, and shall be there in such wise as to be wholly incapable of being in ourselves what He is, but so as, while ourselves not the life, to have Him as our life, who has Himself the life on this very account that He Himself is the life. In short, He both exists unchangeably in Himself and inseparably in the Father. But we, when wishing to exist in ourselves, were thrown into inward trouble regarding ourselves, as is expressed in the words, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is cast down within me:</q>  and changing from bad to worse, cannot even remain as we were. But when by Him we come unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to His own words, <q>No man comes unto the Father but by me,</q> and abide in Him, no one shall be able to separate us either from the Father or from Him.</p>

<p>2. Connecting, therefore, His previous words with those that follow, He proceeded to say, <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, you should certainly have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my Father also.</q> This conforms to His previous words, <q>No man comes unto the Father but by me.</q> And then He adds: <q>And from henceforth ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him.</q> But Philip, one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, not understanding what he had just heard, said, <q>Lord, show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us.</q> And the Lord replied to him, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip? He that sees me, sees also the Father.</q> Here you see He complains that He had been so long time with them, and yet He was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But had He not Himself said, <q>And whither I go ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the way ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>;</q> and on their saying that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, had convinced them that they did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by adding the words: <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life</q>? How, then, says He now, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me?</q> when, in fact, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both whither He went and the way, on no other grounds save that they really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Himself? But this difficulty is easily solved by saying that some of them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, and others did not, and that Philip was one of those who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; so that, when He said, <q>And whither I go ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the way ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> He is understood as having spoken to those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and not to Philip, who has it said to him, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip?</q> To such, then, as already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, was it now also said of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>And from henceforth ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him:</q> for such words were used because of the all-sided likeness subsisting between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; so that, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they might henceforth be said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father. Already, therefore, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, if not all of them, those at least to whom it is said, <q>And whither I go ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the way ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>;</q> for He is Himself the way. But they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and so have also to hear, <q>If you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my Father also;</q> that is, through me you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him also. For I am one, and He another. But that they might not think Him unlike, He adds, <q>And from henceforth ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him.</q> For they saw His perfectly resembling Son, but needed to have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> impressed on them, that exactly such as was the Son whom they saw,was the Father also whom they did not see. And to this points what is afterwards said to Philip, <q>He that sees me, sees also the Father.</q> Not that He Himself was Father and Son, which is a notion of the Sabellians, who are also called Patripassians,  condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but that Father and Son are so alike, that he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both. For we are accustomed to speak in this way of two who closely resemble each other, to those who are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of seeing one of them, and wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what like the other is, so that we say, In seeing the one, you have seen the other. In this way, then, is it said <q>He that sees me, sees also the Father.</q> Not, certainly, that He who is the Son is also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that the Son in no respect disagrees with the likeness of the Father. For had not the Father and Son been two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it would not have been said, <q>If you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my Father also.</q> Such is certainly the case for <q>no one,</q> He says, <q>comes unto the Father but by me: if you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my Father also;</q> because it is I, who am the only way to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that will lead you to Him, that He also may Himself become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you. But as I am in all respects His perfect image, <q>from henceforth ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him</q> in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> me; <q>and have seen Him,</q> if you have seen me with the spiritual eyesight of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>3. Why, then, Philip, do you say, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us? Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip? He that sees me, sees the Father also.</q> If it interests you much to see this, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> at least what you see not. For <q>how,</q> He says, <q>do you say, Show us the Father?</q> If you have seen me, who am His perfect likeness, you have seen Him to whom I am like. And if you can not directly see this, <q>do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> at least, <q>that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me?</q> But Philip might say here, <q>I see You indeed, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Your full likeness to the Father; but is one to be reproved and rebuked because, when he sees one who bears a likeness to another, he wishes to see that other to whom he is like? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, indeed, the image, but as yet I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the one without the other; it is not enough for me, unless I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that other whose likeness he bears. Show us, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us.</q> But the Master really reproved the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> because He saw into the heart of his questioner. For it was with the idea, as if the Father were somehow better than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that Philip had the desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father: and so he did not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because believing that He was inferior to another. It was to correct such a notion that it was said, <q>He that sees me, sees the Father also. How do you say, Show us the Father?</q> I see the meaning of your words: it is not the original likeness you seek to see, but it is that other you think the superior. <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me?</q> Why do you desire to dis cover some distance between those who are thus alike? Why do you crave the separate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who cannot be separated? What, after this, He says not only to Philip, but to all of them together, must not now be thrust into a corner, in order that, by His help, it may be the more carefully expounded.</p>
