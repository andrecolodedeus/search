<h1>Tractate 79 (John 14:29-31)</h1>

<p>1. Our Lord and Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, had said unto His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>If you loved me, you would surely <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because I go unto the Father; for the Father is greater than I.</q> And that He so spoke in His servant-form, and not in that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein He is equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is well known to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as it resides in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, not as it is feigned by the scornful and senseless. And then He added, <q>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> What can He mean by this, when the fact rather is, that a man ought, before it comes to pass, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that which demands his belief? For it forms the very encomium of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> when that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> is not seen. For what greatness is there in believing what is seen, as in those words of the same Lord, when, in reproving a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, He said, <q>Because you have seen, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; blessed are they that see not, and yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q>  And I hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether any one can be said to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what he sees; for this same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is thus defined in the epistle addressed to the Hebrews: <q>Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the substance of those that hope,  the assurance  of things not seen.</q> Accordingly, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in things that are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and that, too, in things which are not seen,  what mean these words of the Lord, <q>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></q>? Ought He not rather to have said, And now I have told you before it come to pass, that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what, when it has come to pass, you shall see? For even he who was told, <q>Because you have seen, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> only what he saw; but he saw one thing, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> another: for he saw Him as man, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to be God. He perceived and touched the living flesh, which he had seen in the act of dying, and he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Deity infolded in that flesh. And so he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with the mind what he did not see, by the help of that which was apparent to his bodily senses. But though we may be said to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we see, just as every one says that he believes his own eyes, yet that is not to be mistaken for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is built up by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; but from things that are seen, we are brought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in those which are invisible. Wherefore, beloved, in the passage before us, when our Lord says, <q>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>;</q> by the words, <q>when it has come to pass,</q> He certainly means, that they would yet see Him after His death, alive, and ascending to His Father; at the sight of which they should then be compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was indeed the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing He could do such a thing, even after predicting it, and also could predict it before He did it: and this they should then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not with a new, but with an augmented <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; or at least [with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>] that had been impaired  by His death, and was now repaired  by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For it was not that they had not previously also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but when His own predictions were actually fulfilled in Him, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which was still weak at the time of His here speaking to them, and at the time of His death almost ceased to exist, sprang up again into new life and increased vigor.</p> 

<p>2. But what says He next? <q>Hereafter I will not talk much with you; for the prince of this world comes;</q> and who is that, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? <q>And has nothing in me;</q> that is to say, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. For by such words He points to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as the prince, not of His creatures, but of sinners, whom He here designates by the name of <em>this world</em>. And as often as the name of the world is used in a bad sense, He is pointing only to the lovers of such a world; of whom it is elsewhere recorded, <q>Whosoever will be a friend of this world, becomes the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171372"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse4">James&nbsp;4:4</a></span> Far be it from us, then, so to understand the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as prince of the world, as if he wielded the government of the whole world, that is, of heaven and earth, and all that is in them; of which sort of world it was said, when we were lecturing on Christ the Word, <q>And the world was made by Him.</q>  The whole world therefore, from the highest heavens to the lowest earth, is subject to the Creator, not to the deserter; to the Redeemer, not to the destroyer; to the Deliverer, not to the enslaver; to the Teacher, not to the deceiver. And in what sense the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is to be understood as the prince of the world, is still more clearly unfolded by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who, after saying, <q>We wrestle not against flesh and blood,</q> that is, against men, went on to say, <q>but against principalities and powers, and the world rulers of this darkness.</q>  For in the very next word he has explained what he meant by <q>world,</q> when he added, <q>of this darkness;</q> so that no one, by the name of the world, should understand the whole creation, of which in no sense are fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the rulers. <q>Of this darkness,</q> he says, that is, of the lovers of this world: of whom, nevertheless, there were some elected, not from any deserving of their own, but by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom he says, <q>You were sometimes darkness; but now are you light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171375"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> For all have been under the rulers of this darkness, that is, [under the rulers] of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, or darkness, as it were, in subjection to darkness: but <q>thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has delivered us,</q> says the same apostle, <q>from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171376"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse12">Colossians&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span> And in Him the prince of this world, that is, of this darkness, had nothing; for neither did He come with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor had His flesh any hereditary taint of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its procreation by the Virgin. And, as if it were said to Him, Why, then, dost Thou die, if You have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to merit the punishment of death? He immediately added, <q>But that the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do: arise, let us go hence.</q> For He was sitting at table with those who were similarly occupied. But <q>let us go,</q> He said, and whither, but to the place where He, who had nothing in Him deserving of death, was to be delivered up to death? But He had the Father's commandment to die, as the very One of whom it had been foretold, <q>Then I paid for that which I took not away;</q>  and so appointed to pay death to the full, while owing it nothing, and to redeem us from the death that was our due. For <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had seized on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as a prey, when, deceived, he presumptuously stretched forth his hand to the tree, and attempted to invade the incommunicable name of that Godhead which was disallowed him, and with which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was endowed by nature, and not by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>.</p>
