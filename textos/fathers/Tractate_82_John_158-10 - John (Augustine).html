<h1>Tractate 82 (John 15:8-10)</h1>

<p>1. The Saviour, in thus speaking to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, commends still more and more the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby we are saved, when He says, <q>Herein is my Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>,  that you bear very much fruit, and be made my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> Whether we say <em><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a></em>, or <em>made bright</em>, both are the rendering given us of one Greek verb, namely <em>doxazein</em> (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BE;&#x1F71;&#x03B6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>). For what is doxa (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;</span>) in Greek, is in Latin <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. I have thought it worth while to mention this, because the apostle says, <q>If <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was justified by works, he has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not before God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171395"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;4:2</a></span> For this is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <em>before God</em>, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not man, is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, when he is justified, not by works, but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that even his doing well is imparted to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as the branch, as I have stated above,  cannot bear fruit of itself. For if herein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, that we bear much fruit, and be made the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us not credit our own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> therewith, as if we had it of ourselves. For of Him is such a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and accordingly therein the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not ours, but His. Hence also, in another passage, after saying, <q>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works;</q> to keep them from the thought that such good works were of themselves, He immediately added, <q>and may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171397"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> For herein is the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, that we bear much fruit, and be made the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And by whom are we so made, but by Him whose mercy has forestalled us? For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. <span class="stiki" id="note171398"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> </p>

<p>2. <q>As the Father has loved me,</q> He says, <q>so have I loved you: continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> Here, then, you see, is the source of our good works. For whence should we have them, were it not that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note171399"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> And how should we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, were it not that we were first loved? With striking clearness is this declared by the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> in his epistle: <q>We <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God because He first loved us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171400"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:19</a></span> But when He says, <q>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you,</q> He indicates no such equality between our nature and His as there is between Himself and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby the Mediator between God and men is the man Christ Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note171401"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> For He is pointed out as Mediator when He says, <q>The Father&mdash; me, and I&mdash; you.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, indeed, also loves us, but in Him; for herein is the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, that we bear fruit in the vine, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and so be made His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>3. <q>Continue ye,</q> He says, <q>in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> How shall we continue? Listen to what follows: <q>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> Love brings about the keeping of His commandments; but does the keeping of His commandments bring about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which precedes? For he has no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ground for keeping the commandments who is destitute of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And so, in saying, <q>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> He shows not the source from which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> springs, but the means whereby it is manifested. As if He said, Think not that you abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> if you keep not my commandments; for it is only if you have kept them that you shall abide. In other words, it will thus be made apparent that you shall abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> if you keep my commandments. So that no one need deceive himself by saying that he loves Him, if he keeps not His commandments. For we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him just in the same measure as we keep His commandments; and the less we keep them, the less we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And although, when He says, <q>Continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> it is not apparent what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> He spoke of; whether the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we bear to Him, or that which He bears to us: yet it is seen at once in the previous clause. For He had there said, <q>So have I loved you;</q> and to these words He immediately adds, <q>Continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q> accordingly, it is that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which He bears to us. What, then, do the words mean, <q>Continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> but just, continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? And what do these mean, <q>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> but, hereby shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you shall abide in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which I bear to you, if you keep my commandments? It is not, then, for the purpose of awakening His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us that we first keep His commandments; but this, that unless He loves us, we cannot keep His commandments. This is a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which lies all disclosed to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, but is hid from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</p>

<p>4. But what are we to make of that which follows: <q>Even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q>? Here also He certainly intended us to understand that fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He was loved of the Father. For this was what He has just said, <q>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you;</q> and then to these He added the words, <q>Continue ye in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q> in that, doubtless, wherewith I have loved you. Accordingly, when He says also of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>I abide in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> we are to understand it of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which was borne Him by the Father. But then, in this case also, is that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which the Father bears to the Son referable to the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as that wherewith we are loved of the Son: seeing that we on our part are sons, not by nature, but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; while the Only-begotten is so by nature and not by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? Or is this even in the Son Himself to be referred to His condition as man? Certainly so. For in saying, <q>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you,</q> He pointed to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that was His as Mediator. For Christ Jesus is the Mediator between God and men, not in respect to His Godhead, but in respect to His manhood.  And certainly it is in reference to this His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that we read, <q>And Jesus increased in wisdom and age, and in favor [<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>] with God and men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171403"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;2:52</a></span> In harmony, therefore, with this, we may rightly say that while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet such <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> belong to the person of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and that by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> so great, that there is none greater, yea, none that even approaches equality. For there were no merits that preceded that assumption of humanity, but all His merits began with that very assumption. The Son, therefore, abides in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith the Father has loved Him, and so has kept His commandments. For what are we to think of Him even as man, but that God is His lifter up?  for the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Only-begotten, co-eternal with Him that begot; but that He might be given to us as Mediator, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ineffable, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us. </p>
