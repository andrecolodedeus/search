<h1>Tractate 83 (John 15:2-12)</h1>

<p>1. You have just heard, beloved, the Lord saying to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> might be in you, and that your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> might be full.</q> And what else is Christ's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in us, save that He is pleased to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over us? And what is this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of ours which He says is to be made full, but our having fellowship with Him? On this account He had said to the blessed Peter, <q>If I wash you not, you shall have no part with me.</q>  His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, therefore, in us is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has bestowed upon us: and that is also our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But over it He rejoiced even from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, when He chose us before the foundation of the world. <span class="stiki" id="note171407"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> Nor can we rightly say that His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was not full; for God's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was never at any time imperfect. But that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of His was not in us: for we, in whom it could be, had as yet no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and even when our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> commenced, it began not to be in Him. But in Him it always was, who in the infallible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His own foreknowledge rejoiced that we should yet be His own. Accordingly, He had a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> over us that was already full, when He rejoiced in foreknowing and foreordaining us: and as little could there be any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> intermingling in that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of His, lest there should be any possible failure in what He foreknew would be done by Himself. Nor, when He began to do what He foreknew that He would do, was there any increase to His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> as the expression of His blessedness; otherwise His making of us must have added to His blessedness. Be such a supposition, brethren, far from our thoughts; for the blessedness of God was neither less without us, nor became greater because of us. His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, therefore, over our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which was always in Him, when He foreknew and foreordained us, began to be in us when He called us; and this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> we properly call our own, as by it we, too, shall yet be blessed: but this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as it is ours, increases and advances, and presses onward perseveringly to its own completion. Accordingly, it has its beginning in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the regenerate, and its completion in the reward when they rise again. Such is my opinion of the purport of the words, <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> might be in you, and that your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> might be made full:</q> that <em>mine</em> <q>might be in you;</q> that <em>yours</em> <q>might be made full.</q> For mine was always full, even before you were called, when you were foreknown as those whom I was afterwards to call; but it finds its place in you also, when you are transformed into that which I have foreknown regarding you. And <q>that yours may be full:</q> for you shall be blessed, what you are not as yet; just as you are now created, who had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before.</p>

<p>2. <q>This,</q> He says, <q>is my injunction, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as I have loved you.</q> Whether we call it injunction or commandment,  both are the rendering of the same Greek word, <em>entol&eacute;</em> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;</span>). But He had already made this same announcement on a former occasion, when, as you ought to remember, I repounded it to you to the best of my ability.  For this is what He says there, <q>A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; as I have loved you, that you also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q>  And so the repetition of this commandment is its commendation: only that there He said, <q>A new commandment I give unto you;</q> and here, <q>This is my commandment:</q> <em>there</em>, as if there had been no such commandment before; and <em>here</em>, as if He had no other commandment to give them. But there it is spoken of as <q>new,</q> to keep us from persevering in our old courses; here, it is called <q>mine,</q> to keep us from treating it with contempt.</p>

<p>3. But when He said in this way here, <q>This is my commandment,</q> as if there were none else, what are we to think, my brethren? Is, then, the commandment about that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, His only one? Is there not also another that is still greater&mdash;that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God? Or has God in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> given us such a charge about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone, that we have no need of searching for others? There are three things at least that the apostle commends when he says, <q>But now abide <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171411"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:13</a></span> And although in charity, that is, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, are comprehended the two commandments; yet it is here declared to be the greatest only, and not the sole one. Accordingly, what a host of commandments are given us about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, what a multitude about hope! Who is there that could collect them together, or suffice to number them? But let us ponder the words of the same apostle: <q>Love is the fullness of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171412"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> And so, where there is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, what can be wanting? And where it is not, what is there that can possibly be profitable? The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> believes, <span class="stiki" id="note171413"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;2:19</a></span> but does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: no one loves who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. One may, indeed, hope for pardon who does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but he hopes in vain; but no one can despair who loves. Therefore, where there is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, there of necessity will there be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope; and where there is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbor, there also of necessity will be the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he that loves not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how loves he his neighbour as himself, seeing that he loves not even himself? Such an one is both impious and iniquitous; and he that loves iniquity, manifestly loves not, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  Let us, therefore, be holding fast to this precept of the Lord, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; and then all else that is commanded we shall do, for all else we have contained in this. But this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is distinguished from that which men bear to one another as such; for in order to mark the distinction, it is added, <q>as I have loved you.</q> And wherefore is it that Christ loves us, but that we may be fitted to reign with Christ? With this aim, therefore, let us also be loving one another, that we may manifest the difference of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from that of others, who have no such motive in loving one another, because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself is wanting. But those whose mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has the possession of God Himself for its object, will <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; and, therefore, even for the very purpose of loving one another, they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. There is no such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as this in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for few have this motive for their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another, that God may be all in all. <span class="stiki" id="note171415"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> </p>
