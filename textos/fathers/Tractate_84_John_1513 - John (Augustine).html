<h1>Tractate 84 (John 15:13)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord, beloved brethren, has defined that fullness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we ought to bear to one another, when He said: <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> Inasmuch, then, as He had said before, <q>This is my commandment, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as I have loved you;</q> and appended to these words what you have just been hearing, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;</q> there follows from this as a consequence, what this same Evangelist John says in his epistle, <q>That as Christ laid down His life for us, even so we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171416"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> loving one another in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as He has loved us, who laid down His life for us. Such also is doubtless the meaning of what we read in the Proverbs of Solomon: <q>If you sit down to supper at the table of a ruler, consider wisely what is set before you; and so put to your hand, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are bound to make similar preparations.</q>  For what is the table of the ruler, but that from which we take the body and blood of Him who laid down His life for us? And what is it to sit thereat, but to approach in humility? And what is it to consider intelligently what is set before you, but worthily to reflect on the magnitude of the favor? And what is it, so to put to your hand, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are bound to make similar preparations, but as I have already said, that, as Christ laid down His life for us, so we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren? For as the Apostle Peter also says, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171418"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> This is to make similar preparations. This it was that the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> did in their burning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and if we celebrate their memories in no mere empty form, and, in the banquet whereat they themselves were filled to the full, approach the table of the Lord, we must, as they did, be also ourselves making similar preparations. For on these very grounds we do not commemorate them at that table in the same way, as we do others who now rest in peace, as that we should also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, but rather that they should do so for us, that we may cleave to their footsteps; because they have actually attained that fullness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, than which, our Lord has told us, there cannot be a greater. For such tokens of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they exhibited for their brethren, as they themselves had equally received at the table of the Lord.</p>

<p>2. But let us not be supposed to have so spoken as if on such grounds we might possibly arrive at an equality with Christ the Lord, if for His sake we have undergone witness-bearing even unto blood. <em>He</em> had power to lay down His life, and to take it again;  but we have no power to live as long as we wish; and die we must, however unwilling: <em>He</em>, by dying, straightway slew death in Himself; we, by His death, are delivered from death: <em>His</em> flesh saw no corruption; <span class="stiki" id="note171420"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse31">Acts&nbsp;2:31</a></span> ours, after corruption, shall in the end of the world be clothed by Him with incorruption: <em>He</em> had no need of us, in order to work out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; we, without Him, can do nothing: <em>He</em> gave Himself as the vine, to us the branches; we, apart from Him, can have no life. Lastly, although brethren die for brethren, yet no <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> blood is ever shed for the remission of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of brethren, as was the case in what He did for us; and in this respect He bestowed not on us anything for imitation, but something for congratulation. In as far, then, as the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have shed their blood for the brethren, so far have they exhibited such tokens of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as they themselves perceived at the table of the Lord. (One might imitate Him in dying, but no one could, in redeeming.)  In all else, then, that I have said, although it is out of my power to mention everything, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Christ is far inferior to Christ Himself. But if any one shall set himself in comparison, I say, not with the power, but with the innocence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and (I would not say) in thinking that he is healing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, but at least that he has no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his own, even so far is his avidity overstepping the requirements of the method of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; it is a matter of considerable moment for him, only he attains not his desire. And well it is that he is admonished in that passage of the Proverbs, which immediately goes on to say, <q>But if your greed is too great, be not desirous of his dainties; for it is better that you take nothing thereof, than that you should take more than is befitting. For such things,</q> it is added, <q>have a life of deceit,</q> that is, of hypocrisy. For in asserting his own sinlessness, he cannot prove, but only pretend, that he is righteous. And so it is said, <q>For such have a deceiving life.</q> There is only One who could at once have <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh and be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Appropriately are we commanded that which follows; and such a word and proverb is well adapted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, when it is said, <q>Lay not yourself out, seeing you are poor, against him that is rich.</q> For the rich man is Christ, who was never obnoxious to punishment either through hereditary or personal debt and is righteous Himself, and justifies others. Lay not yourself out against Him, you who are so poor, that you are manifestly to the eyes of all the daily beggar that you are in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <q>But keep yourself,</q> he says, <q>from your own counsel</q> [<q>cease from your own wisdom</q>&mdash; E.V.]. From what, but from this delusive presumption? For He, indeed, inasmuch as He is not only man but also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can never be chargeable with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>For if you turn your eye upon Him, He will nowhere be visible.</q> <q>Your eye,</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eye, wherewith you distinguish that which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; <q>if you turn it upon Him, He will nowhere be visible,</q> because He cannot be seen with such organs of sight as are yours. <q>For He will provide Himself wings like an eagle's, and will depart to the house of His overseer,</q>  from which, at all events, He came to us, and found us not such as He Himself was who came. Let us therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, even as Christ has loved us, and given Himself for us. <span class="stiki" id="note171423"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> <q>For greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> And let us be imitating Him in such a spirit of reverential <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, that we shall never have the boldness to presume on a comparison between Him and ourselves.</p>
