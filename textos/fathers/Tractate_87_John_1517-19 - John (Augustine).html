<h1>Tractate 87 (John 15:17-19)</h1>

<p>1. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> lesson which precedes this one, the Lord had said: <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain; that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you.</q> On these words you remember that we have already discoursed, as the Lord enabled us. But here, that is, in the succeeding lesson which you have heard read, He says: <q>These things I command you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> And thereby we are to understand that this is our fruit, of which He had said, <q>I have chosen you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain.</q> And what He subjoined, <q>That whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you,</q> He will certainly give us if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; seeing that this very thing He has also given us, in choosing us when we had no fruit, because we had chosen Him not; and appointing us that we should bring forth fruit&mdash;that is, that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another&mdash;a fruit that we cannot have apart from Him, just as the branches can do nothing apart from the vine. Our fruit, therefore, is charity, which the apostle explains to be, <q>Out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171451"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> So <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we one another, and so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we God. For it would be with no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that we loved one another, if we loved not God. For every one loves his neighbor as himself if he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if he loves not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he loves not himself. For on these two commandments of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note171452"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> this is our fruit. And it is in reference, therefore, to such fruit that He gives us commandment when He says, <q>These things I command you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> In the same way also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when wishing to commend the fruit of the Spirit in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, posited this as his principle, saying, <q>The fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q> and then, as if springing from and bound up in this principle, he wove the others together, which are <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meekness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171453"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> For who can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> who loves not good as the source of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? Who can have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace, if he have it not with one whom he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> loves? Who can be long-enduring through persevering continuance in good, save through fervent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Who can be kind, if he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the person he is aiding? Who can be good, if he is not made so by loving? Who can be sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Whose meekness can be beneficial in character, if not regulated by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? And who will abstain from that which is debasing, if he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not that which dignifies? Appropriately, therefore, does the good Master so frequently commend <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as the only thing needing to be commended, without which all other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things can be of no avail, and which cannot be possessed without bringing with it those other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that make a man <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good.</p>

<p>2. But alongside of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we ought also patiently to endure the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the world. For it must of necessity <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> those whom it perceives recoiling from that which is loved by itself. But the Lord supplies us with special consolation from His own case, when, after saying, <q>These things I command you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another,</q> He added, <q>If the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me before [it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>] you.</q> Why then should the member exalt itself above the head? Thou refusest to be in the body if you are unwilling to endure the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the world along with the Head. <q>If you were of the world,</q> He says, <q>the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own.</q> He says this, of course, of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, by itself, He frequently also calls by the name of the world: as when it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world unto Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171454"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> And this also: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171455"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;3:17</a></span> And John says in his epistle: <q>We have an advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and not for ours only, but also [for those] of the whole world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171456"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> The whole world then is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and yet the whole world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The world therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the world, the hostile that which is reconciled, the condemned that which is saved, the polluted that which is cleansed.</p>

<p>3. But that world which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in Christ reconciling unto Himself, which is saved by Christ, and has all its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> freely pardoned by Christ, has been chosen out of the world that is hostile, condemned, and defiled. For out of that mass, which has all perished in Adam, are formed the vessels of mercy, whereof that world of reconciliation is composed, that is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the world which belongs to the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that are formed out of the same mass and fitted to destruction.  Finally, after saying, <q>If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own,</q> He immediately added, <q>But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you.</q> And so these men were themselves also of that world, and, that they might no longer be of it, were chosen out of it, through no merit of their own, for no good works of theirs had preceded; and not by nature, which through <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> had become totally corrupted at its source: but gratuitously, that is, of actual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For He who chose the world out of the world, effected for Himself, instead of finding, what He should choose: for <q>there is a remnant saved according to the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> he adds, <q>then is it no more of works: otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171458"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>4. But if we are asked about the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is borne to itself by that world of perdition which <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the world of redemption; we reply, it loves itself, of course, with a false <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and not with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And hence, it loves itself <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> itself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. For he that loves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  And yet it is said to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, inasmuch as it loves the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that makes it <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and, on the other hand, it is said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> itself, inasmuch as it loves that which causes it injury. It <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature that is in it, and loves the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> what it is, as made by the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and loves what has been wrought in it by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. And hence also, if we rightly understand it, we are at once forbidden and commanded to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it: thus, we are forbidden, when it is said to us, <q>Love not the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171460"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15</a></span> and we are commanded, when it is said to us, <q>Love your enemies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171461"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;6:27</a></span> These constitute the world that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> us. And therefore we are forbidden to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in it that which it loves in itself; and we are enjoined to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in it what it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> in itself, namely, the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the various consolations of His goodness. For we are forbidden to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that is in it, and enjoined to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the nature, while it loves the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in itself, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the nature: so that we may both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> it in a right manner, whereas it loves and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> itself perversely.</p>
