<h1>Tractate 88 (John 15:20-21)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord, in exhorting His servants to endure with patience the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the world, proposes to them no greater and better example than His own; seeing that, as the Apostle Peter says, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171462"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> And if we really do so, we do it by His assistance, who said, <q>Without me you can do nothing.</q> But further, to those to whom He had already said, <q>If the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me before [it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>] you,</q> He now also says in the word you have just been hearing, when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was read, <q>Remember my word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</q> Now in saying, <q>The servant is not greater than his lord,</q> does He not clearly indicate how He would have us understand what He had said above, <q>Henceforth I call you not servants</q>?  For, you see, He calls them servants. For what else can the words imply, <q>The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you</q>? It is clear, therefore, that when it is said, <q>Henceforth I call you not servants,</q> He is to be understood as speaking of that servant  who abides not in the house for ever,  but is characterized by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out; <span class="stiki" id="note171466"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> whereas, when it is here said, <q>The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you,</q> that servant is meant who is distinguished by the clean <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which endures for ever.  For this is the servant who is yet to hear, <q>Well done, good servant: enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171468"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span> </p>

<p>2. <q>But all these things,</q> He says, <q>will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not Him that sent me.</q> And what are <q>all these things</q> that <q>they will do,</q> but what He has just said, namely, that they will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and despise your word? For if they kept not their word, and yet neither <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> nor <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them; or if they even <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, but did not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them: it would not be <em>all these things</em> that they did. But <q>all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,</q>&mdash; what else is that but to say, they will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me in you, they will <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me in you; and your word, just because it is mine, they will not keep? For <q>all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake:</q> not for yours, but <em>mine</em>. So much the more miserable, therefore, are those who do such things on account of that name, as those are blessed who suffer such things in its behalf: as He Himself elsewhere says, <q>Blessed are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171469"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> For that is on my account, or <q>for my name's sake:</q> because, as we are taught by the apostle, <q>He is made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and santification, and redemption; that, according as it is written, He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171470"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30-31</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do such things to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but not for righteousness' sake; and therefore both are alike miserable, those who do, and those who suffer them. The good also do such things to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: where, although the former do so for righteousness' sake, yet the latter suffer them not on the same behalf.</p>

<p>3. But some one says, If, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the good for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the good suffer for righteousness' sake, then surely it is for righteousness' sake that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do so to them; and if such is the case, then also, when the good <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for righteousness' sake, it is for righteousness' sake likewise that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffer. For if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> can assail the good with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, why cannot the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at the hands of the good on the same account; and what is that, but for righteousness' sake? For if the good act not so on the same account as that on which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffer, because the good do so for righteousness' sake, while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffer for unrighteousness, so then neither can the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> act so on the same account as that for which the good suffer, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do so by unrighteousness, while the good suffer for righteousness' sake. And how then will that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <q>All these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,</q> when the former do it not for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, for righteousness' sake, but because of their own iniquity? Such a question is solved in this way, if only we understand the words, <q>All these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,</q> as referring entirely to the righteous, as if it had been said, All these things will you suffer at their hands for my name's sake, so that the words, <q>they will do unto you,</q> are equivalent to these, You will suffer at their hands. But if <q>for my name's sake</q> is to be taken as if He had said, For my name's sake which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in you, so also may the other be taken for that righteousness' sake which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in you; and in this way the good, when they institute <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, may be rightly said to do so both for righteousness' sake, in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for which they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and for that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness'</a> sake which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> themselves; and so also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> may be said to suffer both for the iniquity that is punished in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and for the righteousness which is exercised in their punishment.</p>

<p>4. It may also be inquired, if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, just as ungodly princes and judges, while they were the persecutors of the godly, certainly also punished murderers and adulterers, and all classes of evil-doers whom they ascertained to be acting contrary to the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, how are we to understand the words of the Lord, <q>If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse19">John 15:19</a></span> For those whom it punishes cannot be loved by the world, which, we see, generally punishes the classes of crimes mentioned above, save only that the world is both in those who punish such crimes, and in those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them. Therefore that world, which is to be understood as existing in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and ungodly, both <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> its own in respect of that section of men in whose case it inflicts injury on the criminal, and loves its own in respect of that other section in whose case it shows favor to its own partners in criminality. Hence, <q>All these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,</q> is said either in reference to that for the sake of which you suffer, or to that on account of which they themselves so deal with you, because that which is in you they both <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>. And He added, <q>Because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not Him that sent me.</q> This is to be understood as spoken of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which it is also elsewhere recorded, <q>But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You is perfect intelligence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171471"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse16">Wisdom&nbsp;6:16</a></span> For those who with such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom Christ was sent, can in no wise <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> those whom Christ is gathering; for they also themselves are being gathered by Christ along with the others.</p>
