<h1>Tractate 8 (John 2:1-4)</h1>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> indeed of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whereby He made the water into wine, is not marvellous to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was God's doing. For He who made wine on that day at the marriage feast, in those six water-pots, which He commanded to be filled with water, the self-same does this every year in vines. For even as that which the servants put into the water-pots was turned into wine by the doing of the Lord, so in like manner also is what the clouds pour forth changed into wine by the doing of the same Lord. But we do not wonder at the latter, because it happens every year: it has lost its marvellousness by its constant recurrence. And yet it suggests a greater consideration than that which was done in the water-pots. For who is there that considers the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby this whole world is governed and regulated, who is not amazed and overwhelmed with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? If he considers the vigorous power of a single grain of any seed whatever, it is a mighty thing, it inspires him with awe. But since men, intent on a different matter, have lost the consideration of the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which they should daily praise Him as the Creator, God has, as it were, reserved to Himself the doing of certain extraordinary actions, that, by striking them with wonder, He might rouse men as from sleep to worship Him. A dead man has risen again; men marvel: so many are born daily, and none marvels. If we reflect more considerately, it is a matter of greater wonder for one to be who was not before, than for one who was to come to life again. Yet the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, does by His word all these things; and it is He who created that governs also. The former <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He did by His Word, God with Himself; the latter <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He did by the same Word incarnate, and for us made man. As we wonder at the things which were done by the man Jesus, so let us wonder at the things which where done by Jesus God. By Jesus God were made heaven, and earth, and the sea, all the garniture of heaven, the abounding riches of the earth, and the fruitfulness of the sea&mdash;all these things which lie within the reach of our eyes were made by Jesus God. And we look at these things, and if His own spirit is in us they in such manner please us, that we praise Him that contrived them; not in such manner that turning ourselves to the works we turn away from the Maker, and, in a manner, turning our face to the things made and our backs to Him that made them.</p>

<p>2. And these things indeed we see; they lie before our eyes. But what of those we do not see, as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, powers, dominions, and every inhabitant of this fabric which is above the heavens, and beyond the reach of our eyes? Yet <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, too, when necessary, often showed themselves to men. Has not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all these too by His Word, that is, by His only Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>? What of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, which is not seen, and yet by its works shown in the flesh excites great admiration in those that duly reflect on them&mdash;by whom was it made, unless by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? And through whom was it made, unless through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Not to speak as yet of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man: the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of any brute whatever, see how it regulates the huge body, puts forth the senses, the eyes to see, the ears to hear, the nostrils to smell, the taste to discern flavors&mdash; the members, in short, to execute their respective functions! Is it the body, not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely the inhabitant of the body, that does these things? The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not apparent to the eyes, nevertheless it excites admiration by these its actions. Direct now your consideration to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed understanding to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its Creator, to discern and distinguish between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that is, between right and wrong: see how many things it does through the body! Observe this whole world arranged in the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> commonwealth, with what administrations, with what orderly degrees of authority, with what conditions of citizenship, with what <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, manners, arts! The whole of this is brought about by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and yet this power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not visible. When withdrawn from the body, the latter is a mere carcass: first, it in a manner preserves it from rottenness. For all flesh is corruptible, and falls off into putridity unless preserved by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as by a kind of seasoning. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has this quality in common with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the brute; those qualities rather are to be admired which I have stated, such as belong to the mind and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherein also it is renewed after the image of its Creator, after whose image man was formed. <span class="stiki" id="note170182"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> What will this power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be when this body shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note170183"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> If such is its power, acting through corruptible flesh, what shall be its power through a spiritual body, after the resurrection of the dead? Yet this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as I have said, of admirable nature and substance, is a thing invisible, intellectual; this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Jesus, for He is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. <q>All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q></p>

<p>3. When we see, therefore, such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> wrought by Jesus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why should we wonder at water being turned into wine by the man Jesus? For He was not made man in such manner that He lost His being God. Man was added to Him, God not lost to Him. This <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was wrought by the same who made all those things. Let us not therefore wonder that God did it, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him because He did it in our midst, and for the purpose of our restoration. For He gives us certain intimations by the very circumstances of the case. I suppose that it was not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He came to the marriage. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> apart, there lies something <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> and sacramental in the very fact. Let us knock, that He may open to us, and fill us with the invisible wine: for we were water, and He made us wine, made us wise; for He gave us the wisdom of His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while before we were foolish. And it appertains, it may be, to this wisdom, together with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with the praise of His majesty, and with the charity of His most powerful mercy, to understand what was done in this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.</p>

<p>4. The Lord, on being invited, came to the marriage. What wonder if He came to that house to a marriage, having come into this world to a marriage? For, indeed, if He came not to a marriage, He has not here a bride. But what says the apostle? <q>I have espoused you to one husband, to present you a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Why does he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bride should be corrupted by the subtlety of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> says he, <q>lest as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so also your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170184"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> Thus has He here a bride whom He has redeemed by His blood, and to whom He has given the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as a pledge. He has freed her from the bondage of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: He died for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is risen again for her justification. <span class="stiki" id="note170185"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> Who will make such offerings to his bride? Men may offer to a bride every sort of earthly ornament&mdash;gold, silver, precious stones, houses, slaves, estates, farms&mdash;but will any give his own blood? For if one should give his own blood to his bride, he would not live to take her for his wife. But the Lord, dying without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, gave His own blood for her, whom rising again He was to have, whom He had already united to Himself in the Virgin's womb. For the Word was the Bridegroom, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh the bride; and both one, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the same also being <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. The womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, in which He became head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was His bridal chamber: thence He came forth, as a bridegroom from his chamber, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> foretold, <q>And rejoiced as a giant to run his way.</q>  From His chamber He came forth as a bridegroom; and being invited, came to the marriage.</p>

<p>5. It is because of an indubitable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that He appears not to acknowledge His mother, from whom as the Bridegroom He came forth, when He says to her, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come.</q> What is this? Did He come to the marriage for the purpose of teaching men to treat their mothers with contempt? Surely he to whose marriage He had come was taking a wife with the view of having children, and surely he wished to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by those children he would beget: had Jesus then come to the marriage in order to dishonor His mother, when marriages are celebrated and wives married with the view of having children, whom God commands to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? Beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, brethren, there is some <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> lurking here. It is really a matter of such importance that some&mdash;of whom the apostle, as we have mentioned before, has forewarned us to be on our guard, saying, <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so also your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q>&mdash; taking away from the credibility of the gospel, and asserting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, used to endeavor to draw from this place an argument in support of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so far as to say, How could she be His mother, to whom He said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> Wherefore we must answer them, and show them why the Lord said this, lest in their insanity they appear to themselves to have discovered something contrary to wholesome belief, whereby the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the virgin bride may be corrupted, that is, whereby the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be injured. For in very deed, brethren, their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is corrupted who prefer a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For these men, who appear to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Christ in such wise as to deny that He had flesh, do nothing short of proclaiming Him a liar. Now they who build up a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> in men, what do they but drive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> out of them? They let in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, they drive Christ out; they let in an adulterer, shut out the bridegroom, being evidently paranymphs, or rather, the panderers of the serpent. For it is for this object they speak, that the serpent may possess, and Christ be shut out. How does the serpent possess? When a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> possesses. When <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> possesses, then the serpent possesses; when <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> possesses, then Christ possesses. For Himself has said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170187"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> but of that other He said, <q>He stood not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170188"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> And Christ is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in such wise that you should receive the whole to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in Him. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Word, God equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nativity, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> passion, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> death, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resurrection. If you say that any of these is false, rottenness enters, the worms of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> are bred of the poison of the serpent, and nothing sound will remain.</p>

<p>6. What, then, is this, says one, which the Lord says, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> Perhaps the Lord shows us in the sequel why He said this: <q>Mine hour,</q> says He, <q>is not yet come.</q> For thus is how He says, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come.</q> And we must seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why this was said. But first let us therefrom withstand the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. What says the old serpent, of old the hissing instiller of poison? What says he? That Jesus had not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for His mother. Whence do you prove that? From this, says he, because Jesus said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> Who has related this, that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said it? Who has related it? None other than John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>. But the same John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> said, <q>And the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there.</q> For this is how he has told us: <q>The next day there was a marriage in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there. And having been invited to the marriage, Jesus had come there with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> We have here two sayings uttered by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>. <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> said the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>; and it is the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> that has told us what Jesus said to His mother. And see, brethren, how he has told us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered His <em> mother</em>, having said first, <q>His mother said unto Him,</q> in order that you may keep the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of your heart secure against the tongue of the serpent. Here we are told in the same <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the record of the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> and <q>His mother said unto Him.</q> Who related this? John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>. And what said Jesus in answer to His mother? <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> Who relates this? The very same Evangelist John. O most faithful and truth-speaking <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, you tell me that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> why have you added His mother, whom He does not acknowledge? For you have said that <q>the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> and that <q>His mother said unto Him;</q> why did you not rather say, Mary was there, and Mary said unto Him. Thou tellest as these two facts, <q>His mother said unto Him,</q> and <q>Jesus answered her, Woman, why have I to do with you?</q> Why do you do this, if it be not because both are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Now, those men are willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> in the one case, when he tells us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to His mother, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> and yet they will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him in the other, when he says, <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> and <q>His mother said unto Him.</q> But who is he that resists the serpent and holds fast the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of heart is not corrupted by the subtlety of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? He who believes both to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, namely, that the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made that answer to His mother. But if he does not as yet understand in what manner Jesus said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> let him meanwhile <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He said it, and said it, moreover, to His mother. Let him first have the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and he will then have fruit in understanding.</p>

<p>7. I ask you, O faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Was the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> there? Answer ye, She was. Whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you? Answer, The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says it. What answer made Jesus to His mother? Answer ye, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come.</q> And whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you this? Answer, The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says it. Let no man corrupt this your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if you desire to preserve a chaste <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> for the Bridegroom. But if it be asked of you, why He made this answer to His mother, let him declare who understands; but he who does not as yet understand, let him most firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made this answer, and made it moreover to His mother. By this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> he will learn to understand also why Jesus answered thus, if by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> he knock at the door of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and do not approach it with wrangling. Only this much, while he fancies himself to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or is ashamed because he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, why Jesus answered thus, let him beware lest he be constrained to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> lied when he said, <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> or that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself suffered for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by a counterfeit death and for our justification showed counterfeit scars; and that He spoke <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in saying, <q>If you continue in my word, you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed; and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall make you free.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170189"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;8:31</a></span> For if He had a false mother, false flesh, false death, false wounds in His death, false scars in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, then it will not be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but rather <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, that shall make free those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. Nay, on the contrary, let <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> yield to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and let all be confounded who would have themselves be accounted truth-speaking, because they endeavor to prove Christ a deceiver, and will not have it said to them, We do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you because you lie, when they affirm that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself has lied. Nevertheless, if we ask them, Whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you that Christ said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> they answer that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Then why do they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> when it says, <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> and, <q>His mother said unto Him</q>? Or if the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> lies here, how are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it there, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said this, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> Why do not those miserable men rather faithfully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Lord did so answer, not to a stranger, but to His mother; and also piously seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why He did so answer? There is a great difference between him who says, I would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why Christ made this answer to His mother, and him who says, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not to His mother that Christ made this answer. It is one thing to be willing to understand what is shut up, another thing to be unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is open. He who says, I would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why Christ thus made answer to His mother, wishes the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in which he believes, opened up to him; but he who says, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not to His mother that Christ made this answer, accuses of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> the very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, wherein he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that Christ did so answer.</p>

<p>8. Now then, if it seem good, brethren, those men being repulsed, and ever wandering in their own blindness, unless in humility they be healed, let us inquire why our Lord answered His mother in such a manner. He was in an extraordinary manner begotten of the Father without a mother, born of a mother without a father; without a mother He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without a father He was man; without a mother before all time, without a father in the end of times. What He said was said in answer to His mother, for <q>the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> and <q>His mother said unto Him.</q> All this the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says. It is there we learn that <q>the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there,</q> just where we learn that He said unto her, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come.</q> Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the whole; and what we do not yet understand, let us search out. And first take care, lest perhaps, as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> found occasion for their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, because the Lord said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> the astrologers in like manner may find occasion for their deception, in that He said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> If it was in the sense of the astrologers He said this, we have committed a sacrilege in burning their books. But if we have acted rightly, as was done in the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note170190"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse19">Acts&nbsp;19:19</a></span> it was not according to their notion that the Lord said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> For, say those vain-talkers and deceived seducers, you see that Christ was under <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as He says, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> To whom then must we make answer first&mdash; to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or to the astrologers? For both come of the serpent, and desire to corrupt the Church's <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of heart, which she holds in undefiled <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Let us first reply to those whom we proposed, to whom, indeed, we have already replied in great measure. But lest they should think that we have not what to say of the words which the Lord uttered in answer to His mother, we prepare you further against them; for I suppose what has already been said is sufficient for their refutation.</p>

<p>9. Why, then, said the Son to the mother, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? Mine hour is not yet come?</q> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. According as He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He had not a mother; according as He was man, He had. She was the mother, then, of His flesh, of His humanity, of the weakness which for our sakes He took upon Him. But the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which He was about to do, He was about to do according to His divine nature, not according to His weakness; according to that wherein He was God not according to that wherein He was born weak. But the weakness of God is stronger than men. <span class="stiki" id="note170191"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:25</a></span> His mother then demanded a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of Him; but He, about to perform divine works, so far did not recognize a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> womb; saying in effect, <q>That in me which works a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was not born of you, you gave not birth to my divine nature; but because my weakness was born of you, I will recognize you at the time when that same weakness shall hang upon the cross.</q> This, indeed, is the meaning of <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> For then it was that He recognized, who, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, always did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> His mother in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, even before He was born of her; even before, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He created her of whom, as man, He was to be created, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her as His mother: but at a certain hour in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> He did not recognize her; and at a certain hour which had not yet come, again in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, He does recognize her. For then did He recognize her, when that to which she gave birth was a-dying. That by which Mary was made did not die, but that which was made of Mary; not the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the divine nature, but the weakness of the flesh, was dying. He made that answer therefore, making a distinction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, between the <em>who</em>; and the <em>how</em>, He came. For while He was God and the Lord of heaven and earth, He came by a mother who was a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. In that He was Lord of the world, Lord of heaven and earth, He was, of course, the Lord of Mary also; but in that wherein it is said, <q>Made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law,</q> He was Mary's son. The same both the Lord of Mary and the son of Mary; the same both the Creator of Mary and created from Mary. Marvel not that He was both son and Lord. For just as He is called the son of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, so likewise is He called the son of David; and son of David because son of Mary. Hear the apostle openly declaring, <q>Who was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170192"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Hear Him also declared the Lord of David; let David himself declare this: <q>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand.</q>  And this passage Jesus Himself brought forward to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and refuted them from it. <span class="stiki" id="note170194"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;22:45</a></span> How then was He both David's son and David's Lord? David's son according to the flesh, David's Lord according to His divinity; so also Mary's son after the flesh, and Mary's Lord after His majesty. Now as she was not the mother of His divine nature, while it was by His divinity the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> she asked for would be wrought, therefore He answered her, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> But think not that I deny you to be my mother: <q>Mine hour is not yet come;</q> for in that hour I will acknowledge you, when the weakness of which you are the mother comes to hang on the cross. Let us prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this. When the Lord suffered, the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> tells us, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the mother of the Lord, and who has given us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about her in this marriage feast,&mdash; the same, I say, tells us, <q>There was there near the cross the mother of Jesus; and Jesus says to His mother, Woman, behold your son! And to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, Behold your mother!</q>  He commends His mother to the care of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; commends His mother, as about to die before her, and to rise again before her death. The man commends her a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being to man's care. This humanity had Mary given birth to. That hour had now come, the hour of which He had then said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q></p>

<p>10. In my opinion, brethren, we have answered the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Let us now answer the astrologers. And how do they attempt to prove that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was under <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>? Because, say they, Himself said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> Therefore we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him; and if He had said, <q>I have no hour,</q> He would have excluded the astrologers: but behold, say they, He said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q> If then He had said, <q>I have no hour,</q> the astrologers would have been shut out, and would have no ground for their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>; but now that He said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come,</q> how can we contradict His own words? 'Tis wonderful that the astrologers, by believing Christ's words, endeavor to convince <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that Christ lived under an hour of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. Well, let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Christ when He says, <q>I have power to lay down my life and to take it up again: no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself, and I take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170196"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> Is this power then under <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>? Let them show us a man who has it in his power when to die, how long to live: this they can never do. Let them, therefore, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God when He says, <q>I have power to lay down my life, and to take it up again;</q> and let them inquire why it was said, <q>Mine hour is not yet come;</q> and let them not because of these words, be imposing <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> on the Maker of heaven, the Creator and Ruler of the stars. For even if <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> were from the stars, the Maker of the stars could not be subject to their destiny. Moreover, not only Christ had not what you call <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, but not even have you, or I, or he there, or any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being whatsoever.</p>

<p>11. Nevertheless, being deceived, they deceive others, and propound fallacies to men. They lay snares to catch men, and that, too, in the open streets. They who spread nets to catch wild beasts even do it in woods and desert places: how miserably vain are men, for catching whom the net is spread in the forum! When men sell themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they receive money; but these give money in order to sell themselves to vanities. For they go in to an astrologer to buy themselves masters, such as the astrologer is pleased to give them: be it Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, or any other named profanity. The man went in free, that having given his money he might come out a slave. Nay, rather, had he been free he would not have gone in; but he entered whither his master Error and his mistress Avarice dragged him. Whence also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> says, <q>Every one that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the slave of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note170197"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> </p>

<p>12. Why then did He say, <q>Mine hour is not yet come?</q> Rather because, having it in His power when to die, He did not yet see it fit to use that power. Just as we, brethren, say, for example, <q>Now is the appointed hour for us to go out to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</q> If we go out before it is necessary, do we not act perversely and absurdly? And because we act only at the proper time, do we therefore in this action regard <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> when we so express ourselves? What means then, <q>Mine hour is not yet come?</q> When I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is the fitting time for me to suffer, when my suffering will be profitable, then I will willingly suffer. That hour is not yet: that you may preserve both, this, <q>Mine hour is not yet come;</q> and that, <q>I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it again.</q> He had come, then, having it in His power when to die. And surely it would not have been right were He to die before He had chosen <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Had he been a man who had not his hour in his own power, he might have died before he had chosen <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and if haply he had died when his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were now chosen and instructed, it would be something conferred on him, not his own doing. But, on the contrary, He who had come having in His power when to go, when to return, how far to advance, and for whom the regions of the grave were open, not only when dying but when rising again; He, I say, in order to show us His Church's hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, showed in the head what it behooved the members to expect. For He who has risen again in the head will also rise again in all His members. The hour then had not yet come, the fit time was not yet. Disciples had to be called, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to be proclaimed, the Lord's divinity to be shown forth in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and His humanity in His very sympathy with mortal men. For He who hungered because He was man, fed so many thousands with five loaves because He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; He who slept because He was man, commanded the winds and the waves because He was God. All these things had first to be set forth, that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> might have whereof to write, that there might be what should be preached to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But when He had done as much as He judged to be sufficient, then His hour came, not of necessity, but of will,&mdash; not of condition, but of power.</p>

<p>13. What then, brethren? Because we have replied to these and those, shall we say nothing as to what the water-pots signify? What the water turned into wine? What the master of the feast? What the bridegroom? What in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the mother of Jesus? What the marriage itself? We must speak of all these, but we must not burden you. I would have preached to you in Christ's name yesterday also, when the usual sermon was due to you, my beloved, but I was hindered by certain necessities. If you please then, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, let us defer until tomorrow what pertains to the hidden meaning of this translation, and not burden both your and our own weakness. There are many of you, perhaps, who have today come together on account of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the day, not to hear the sermon. Let those who come tomorrow come to hear, so that we may not defraud those who are eager to learn, nor burden those who are fastidious.</p>
