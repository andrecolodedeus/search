<h1>Tractate 90 (John 15:23)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord says, as you have just been hearing, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> me, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> my Father also:</q> and yet He had said a little before, <q>These things will they do unto you, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not Him that sent me.</q> A question therefore arises that cannot be overlooked, how they can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> one whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not? For if it is not God as He really is, but something else, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what, that they suspect or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> this; then assuredly it is not God Himself that they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, but the thing they conceive in their own erroneous suspicion or baseless credulity; and if they think of Him as He really is, how can they be said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not? It may be the case, indeed, with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that we frequently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those whom we have never seen; and in this way it can, on the other hand, be none the less impossible that we should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> those whom we have never seen. The report, for instance, whether good or bad, about some preacher, leads us not improperly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the unknown. But if the report is truthful, how can one, of whom we have got such <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> accounts, be spoken of as unknown? Is it because we have not seen his face? And yet, though he himself does not see it, he can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no one better than to himself. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any one, therefore, is not conveyed to us in his bodily countenance, but only lies open to our apprehension when his life and character are revealed. Otherwise no one would be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself, because unable to see his own face. But surely he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself more certainly than he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to others, inasmuch as by inward inspection he can the more certainly see what he is conscious of, what he desires, what he is living for; and it is when these are likewise laid open to us, that he becomes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to ourselves. And as these, accordingly, are commonly brought to us regarding the absent, or even the dead, either by hearsay or correspondence, it thus comes about that people whom we have never seen by face (and yet of whom we are not entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>), we frequently either <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>2. But in such cases our credulity is frequently at fault; for sometimes even history, and still more ordinary report, turns out to be false. Yet, it ought to be our concern, in order not to be misled by an injurious opinion, seeing we cannot search into the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to have a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and certain sentiment about things themselves. I mean, that in regard to this or that man, if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether he is immodest or modest, we should at all events <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> immodesty and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> modesty: and if in regard to some one or other we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether he is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> or just, we should at any rate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and abhor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; not such things as we erroneously fancy to ourselves, but such as we believingly perceive according to God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the one to be desired, the other to be shunned; so that, when in regard to things themselves we do desire what ought to be desired, and utterly avoid what ought to be avoided, we may find pardon for the mistaken feelings which we at times, yea, at all times, entertain regarding the actual state of others which is hidden from our eyes. For this, I think, has to do with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, without which we cannot pass through this life, so that the apostle said, <q>No <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> should befall you but such as is common to man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171479"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> For what is so common to man as inability to inspect the heart of man; and therefore, instead of scrutinizing its inmost recesses, to suspect for the most part something very different from what is going on therein? And although in these dark regions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> realities, that is, of other people's inward thoughts, we cannot clear up our suspicions, because we are only men, yet we ought to restrain our judgments, that is, all definite and fixed opinions, and not judge anything before the time, until the Lord come, and bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note171480"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> When, therefore, we are falling into no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in regard to the thing itself, so that there is an accordance with right in our reprobation of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and approbation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; surely, if a mistake is committed in connection with individuals, a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> so characteristic of man is within the scope of forgiveness.</p>

<p>3. But amid all these darknesses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hearts, it happens as a thing much to be wondered at and mourned over, that one, whom we account <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and who nevertheless is just, and in whom, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, we sometimes avoid, and turn away from, and hinder from approaching us, and refuse to have life and living in common with him; and, if necessity compel the infliction of discipline, whether to save others from harm or bring the person himself back to rectitude, we even pursue him with a salutary harshness; and so afflict a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man as if he were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and one whom unknowingly we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. This takes place if one, for example's sake, who is modest is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by us to be the opposite. For, beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, if I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a modest person, he is himself the very object that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and therefore I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the man himself, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not. And if I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> an immodest person, it is on that account, not him that I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>: for he is not the thing that I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; and yet to that object of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, with whom my heart makes continual abode in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of modesty, I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> doing an injury, erring as I do, not in the distinction I make between <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but in the thick darkness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart. Accordingly, as it may so happen that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man may unknowingly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, or rather loves him without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it (for the man himself he loves in loving that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for what the other is, is the very thing that he loves); and without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not the man himself, but that which he supposes him to be: so may it also be the case that an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> man <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and, while he opines that he loves one who is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> like himself, unknowingly loves the just man; and yet so long as he believes him to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, he loves not the man himself, but that which he imagines him to be. And as it is with another man, so is it also with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, to conclude, had the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> been asked if they loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what other answer would they have given but that they did <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and that not with any intentional <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, but because erroneously fancying that they did so? For how could they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who were filled with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself? For they do not wish their own conduct to be condemned, and it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> task to condemn such conduct; and thus they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as much as they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> their own punishment, which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> awards to such. But they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which lays its condemnation on such as they: therefore they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> that which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; and hating it, they certainly cannot but also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him of whom it is born. And in this way, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by whose judgment they are condemned, as that which is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; of a surety also they both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> [the Father] Himself. Miserable men! Who, because wishing to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, deny that to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are condemned. For they refuse to own that to be what it is, when they ought themselves to refuse to be what they are; in order that, while it remains the same, they may be changed, lest by its judgment they fall into condemnation.</p>
