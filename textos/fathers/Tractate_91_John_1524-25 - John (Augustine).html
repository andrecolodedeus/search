<h1>Tractate 91 (John 15:24-25)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord had said, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> me, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> my Father also.</q> For of a certainty he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him of whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is born; on which subject we have already spoken, as we were granted ability. And then He added the words on which we have now to discourse: <q>If I had not done among [in] them the works which none other man did, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> To wit, that great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereof He also says before, <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was that of not believing on Him who thus spoke and wrought. For they were not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before He so spoke to them and did such works among them; but this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of theirs, in not believing on Him, is thus specially mentioned because really inclusive in itself of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> besides. For had they been clear of this one, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, all else would also have been forgiven.</p>

<p>2. But what is meant when, after saying, <q>If I had not done among them works,</q> He immediately added, <q>which none other man did</q>? Of a certainty, among all the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, none seem to be greater than the raising of the dead; and yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the same was done by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of olden time. For Elias did so; <span class="stiki" id="note171481"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:21-22</a></span> and Elisha also, both when alive in the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note171482"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse35">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:35</a></span> and when he lay buried in his sepulchre. For when certain men, who were carrying a dead person, had fled there for refuge from an onset of their enemies, and had laid him down therein, he instantly came again to life. <span class="stiki" id="note171483"><a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;13:21</a></span> And yet there were some works that Christ did which none other man did: as, when He fed the five thousand men with five loaves, and the four thousand with seven;  when He walked on the waters, and gave Peter power to do the same; <span class="stiki" id="note171485"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;14:25-29</a></span> when He changed the water into wine; <span class="stiki" id="note171486"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> when He opened the eyes of a man that was born blind, <span class="stiki" id="note171487"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;9:7</a></span> and many besides, which it would take long to mention. But we are answered, that others also have done works which even He did not, and which no other man has done. For who else save <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> smote the Egyptians with so many and mighty plagues, <span class="stiki" id="note171488"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm">Exodus&nbsp;vii.-xii</a></span> as when He led the people through the parted waters of the sea, <span class="stiki" id="note171489"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;14:21-29</a></span> when he obtained manna for them from heaven in their hunger, <span class="stiki" id="note171490"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm">Exodus&nbsp;xvi</a></span> and water from the rock in their thirst? <span class="stiki" id="note171491"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;17:6</a></span> Who else save Joshua the son of Nun  divided the stream of the Jordan for the people to pass over, <span class="stiki" id="note171493"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm">Joshua&nbsp;iii</a></span> and by the utterance of a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God bridled and stopped the revolving sun? <span class="stiki" id="note171494"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse12">Joshua&nbsp;10:12-14</a></span> Who save Samson ever quenched his thirst with water flowing forth from the jawbone of a dead ass? <span class="stiki" id="note171495"><a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#verse19">Judges&nbsp;15:19</a></span> Who save Elias was carried aloft in a chariot of fire? <span class="stiki" id="note171496"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Who save Elisha, as I have just mentioned, after his own body was buried, restored the dead body of another to life? Who else besides Daniel lived unhurt amid the jaws of famishing lions, that were shut up with him? <span class="stiki" id="note171497"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse22">Daniel&nbsp;6:22</a></span> And who else save the three men Ananias, Azariah, and Mishael, ever walked about unharmed in flames that blazed and did not burn? <span class="stiki" id="note171498"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse23">Daniel&nbsp;3:23-27</a></span> </p>

<p>3. I pass by other examples, as these I consider to be sufficient to show that some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, which none other man did. But we read of no one whatever of the ancients who cured with such power so many bodily defects, and bad states of the health, and troubles of mortals. For, to say nothing of those individual cases which He healed, as they occurred, by the word of command, the Evangelist Mark says in a certain place: <q>And at even, when the sun had set, they brought unto Him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. And all the city was gathered together at the door. And He healed many that were sick of various diseases, and cast out many devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171499"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;1:32-34</a></span> And Matthew, in giving us the same account, has also added the prophetic testimony, when he says: <q>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sickness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171500"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;8:17</a></span> In another passage also it is said by Mark: <q>And wherever He entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that they might touch if it were but the border of His garment: and as many as touched Him were made whole.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171501"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse56">Mark&nbsp;6:56</a></span> None other man did such things <em>in</em> them. For so are we to understand the words <em>in them</em>, not among them, or in their presence; but directly <em>in them</em>, because He healed them. For He wished them to understand the works as those which not only occasioned admiration, but conferred also manifest healing, and were benefits which they ought surely to have requited with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and not with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. He transcends, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of all besides, in being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and in possessing alone the power, both in His conception and birth, to preserve inviolate the integrity of His mother: but that was done neither before their eyes nor in them. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of such a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was reached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, not through any onlooking that they had in common with others, but in the course of their separate discipleship. Moreover, the fact that on the third day He restored Himself to life from the very tomb, in the flesh wherein He had been slain, and, never thereafter to die, with it ascended into heaven, even surpasses all else that He did: but just as little was this done either in the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or before their eyes; nor had it yet been done, when He said, <q>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did.</q></p>

<p>4. The works, then, are doubtless those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing in connection with their bodily complaints which He exhibited to such an extent as no one before had furnished among them: for these they saw, and it is in reproaching them therewith that He proceeds to say, <q>But now have they both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both me and my Father: but [this comes to pass] that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> [gratuitously].</q> He calls it, their law, not as invented by them, but given to them: just as we say, <q>Our daily bread;</q> which, nevertheless, we ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in conjoining the words <q>Give us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171502"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;6:11</a></span> But one <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> gratuitously who neither seeks advantage from the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> nor avoids inconvenience: so do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the Lord; and so also is He loved by the righteous, that is to say, gratuitously [gratis, freely,] inasmuch as they expect no other gifts beyond Himself, for He Himself will be all in all. But whoever would be disposed to look for something more profound in the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did</q> (for although such were done by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, yet no one else did them, for the whole Trinity is one and the same in substance), he will find that it was He who did it even when some man of God did something similar. For in Himself He can do everything by Himself; but without Him no one can do anything. For Christ with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are not three Gods, but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom it is written, <q>Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who only does wondrous things.</q>  No one else, therefore, really himself did the works which He did among them; for any one else who did any such works, did them only through His doing. But He Himself did them without any doing on their part.</p>
