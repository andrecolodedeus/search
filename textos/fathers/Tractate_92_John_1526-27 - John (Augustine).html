<h1>Tractate 92 (John 15:26-27)</h1>

<p>1. The Lord Jesus, in the discourse which He addressed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after the supper, when Himself in immediate proximity to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and, as it were, on the eve of departure, and of depriving them of His bodily presence while continuing His spiritual presence to all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> till the very end of the world, exhorted them to endure the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, whom He distinguished by the name of the world: and from which He also told them that He had chosen the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> themselves, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it was by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God they were what they were, and by their own <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> they had been what they had been. And then His own persecutors and theirs He clearly signified to be the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that it might be perfectly apparent that they also were included in the appellation of that damnable world that persecutes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. And when He had said of them that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not Him that sent Him, and yet <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both the Son and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is, both Him who was sent and Him who sent Him&mdash;of all which we have already treated in previous discourses&mdash;He reached the place where it is said, <q>This comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</q> And then He added, as if by way of consequence, the words whereon we have undertaken at present to discourse: <q>But when the Comforter has come, whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me: and you also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, because you have been with me from the beginning.</q> But what connection has this with what He had just said, <q>But now have they both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both me and my Father: but that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a></q>? Was it that the Comforter, when He came, even the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, convicted those, who thus saw and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, by a still clearer testimony? Yea, verily, some even of those who saw, and still <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, He did convert, by this manifestation of Himself, to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note171504"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> To make this view of the passage intelligible, we recall to your mind that so it actually befell. For when on the day of Pentecost the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> fell upon an assembly of one hundred and twenty men, among whom were all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and when they, filled therewith were speaking in the language of every nation; a goodly number of those who had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, amazed at the magnitude of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> (especially when they perceived in Peter's address so great and divine a testimony borne in behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as that He, who was slain by them and accounted among the dead, was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have risen again, and to be now alive), were pricked in their hearts and converted; and so became aware of the beneficent character of that precious blood which had been so impiously and cruelly shed, because themselves redeemed by the very blood which they had shed. <span class="stiki" id="note171505"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;2:2</a></span> For the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was shed so efficaciously for the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that it could wipe out even the very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of shedding it. With this therefore in His eye, the Lord said, <q>They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: but when the Comforter has come, He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me;</q> saying, as it were, They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me, and slew me when I stood visibly before their eyes; but such shall be the testimony borne in my behalf by the Comforter, that He will bring them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me when I am no longer visible to their sight.</p>

<p>2. <q>And ye also,</q> He says, <q>shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, because you have been with me from the beginning.</q> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and so also shall you. For, just because you have been with me from the beginning, you can preach what ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; which you cannot do at present, because the fullness of that Spirit is not yet present within you. <q>He therefore shall testify of me, and you also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>:</q> for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God shed abroad in your hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who shall be given unto you, <span class="stiki" id="note171506"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> will give you the confidence needful for such witness-bearing. And that certainly was still wanting to Peter, when, terrified by the question of a lady's maid, he could give no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> testimony; but, contrary to his own promise, was driven by the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> thrice to deny Him. <span class="stiki" id="note171507"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse69">Matthew&nbsp;26:69-74</a></span> But there is no such <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note171508"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> In fine, before the Lord's passion, his slavish <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was questioned by a bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; but after the Lord's resurrection, his free <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by the very Lord of freedom: <span class="stiki" id="note171509"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;21:15</a></span> and so on the one occasion he was troubled, on the other tranquillized; there he denied the One he had loved, here he loved the One he had denied. But still even then that very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was weak and straitened, till strengthened and expanded by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And then that Spirit, pervading him thus with the fullness of richer <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, kindled his hitherto frigid heart to such a witness-bearing for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and unlocked those lips that in their previous tremor had suppressed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that, when all on whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had descended were speaking in the tongues of all nations to the crowds of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> collected around, he alone broke forth before the others in the promptitude of his testimony in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and confounded His murderers with the account of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And if any one would enjoy the pleasure of gazing on a sight so charming in its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, let him read the Acts of the Apostles: <span class="stiki" id="note171510"><a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts&nbsp;ii.-v</a></span> and there let him be filled with amazement at the preaching of the blessed Peter, over whose denial of his Master he had just been mourning; there let him behold that tongue, itself translated from diffidence to confidence, from bondage to liberty, converting to the confession of Christ the tongues of so many of His enemies, not one of which he could bear when lapsing himself into denial. And what shall I say more? In him there shone forth such an effulgence of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and such a fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and such a weight of most precious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> poured from the lips of the preacher, that he transformed that vast multitude of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were the adversaries and murderers of Christ into men that were ready to die for His name, at whose hands he himself was formerly afraid to die with his Master. All this did that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> when sent, who had previously only been promised. And it was these great and marvellous gifts of His own that the Lord foresaw, when He said, <q>They have both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both me and my Father: that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But when the Comforter has come, whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall testify of me: and you also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</q> For He, in bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> Himself, and inspiring such witnesses with invincible <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, divested Christ's friends of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and transformed into <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of His enemies.</p>
