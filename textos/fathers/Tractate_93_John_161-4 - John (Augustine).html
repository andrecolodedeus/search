<h1>Tractate 93 (John 16:1-4)</h1>

<p>1. In the words preceding this chapter of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the Lord strengthened His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to endure the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of their enemies, and prepared them also by His own example to become the more courageous in imitating Him: adding the promise, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should come to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Him, and also that they themselves could become His witnesses, through the effectual working of His Spirit in their hearts. For such is His meaning when He says, <q>He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me, and you also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</q> That is to say, because He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, you also shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: He in your hearts, you in your voices; He by inspiration, you by utterance: that the words might be fulfilled, <q>Their sound has gone forth into all the earth.</q>  For it would have been to little purpose to have exhorted them by His example, had He not also filled them with His Spirit. Just as we see that the Apostle Peter, after having heard His words, when He said, <q>The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you;</q>  and seen that already fulfilled in Him, wherein, had example been sufficient, he ought to have imitated the patient endurance of his Lord, yet succumbed and fell into denial, as utterly unable to bear what He saw his Master enduring. But when he really received the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he preached Him whom he had denied; and whom he had been afraid to confess, he had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> now in openly proclaiming. Already, indeed, had he been sufficiently taught by example to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was proper to be done; but not yet was he inspired with the power to do what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: he had got instruction to stand, but not the strength to keep him from falling. But after this was supplied by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he preached Christ even to the death, whom, in his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, he had previously denied. And so the Lord in this succeeding chapter, on which we have now to address you, says, <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be offended.</q> As it is sung in the psalm, <q>Great peace have they who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your law, and nothing shall offend them.</q>  Properly enough, therefore, with the promise of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whose operation in their hearts they should be made His witnesses, He added, <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be offended.</q> For when the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> given unto us, <span class="stiki" id="note171514"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> they have great peace who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God's law, so that nothing may offend them.</p>

<p>2. And then He expressly declares what they were to suffer: <q>They shall put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>.</q> But what harm was it for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to be expelled from the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, as if they were not to separate themselves therefrom, although no one expelled them? Doubtless He meant to announce with reprobation, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would refuse to receive Christ, from whom they as certainly would refuse to withdraw; and so it would come to pass that the latter, who could not exist without Him, would also be cast out along with Him by those who would not have Him as their place of abode. For certainly, as there was no other people of God than that seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, they would, had they only acknowledged and received Christ, have remained as the natural branches in the olive tree; <span class="stiki" id="note171515"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;11:17</a></span> nor would the churches of Christ have been different from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for they would have been one and the same, had they also desired to abide in Him. But having refused, what remained but that, continuing themselves out of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they put out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> those who would not abandon Christ? For having received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and so become His witnesses, they would certainly not belong to the class of whom it is said: <q>Many of the chief rulers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him; but for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they dared not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And so they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but not in the way He wished them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when He said: <q>How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who expect <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> one of another, and seek not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that comes from God only?</q>  It is, therefore, with those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, that, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or, in other words, with the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, they no longer belong to those who, <q><a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and going about to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171518"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> nor to those of whom it is said, <q>They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God:</q> that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> harmonizes, which finds its fulfillment in their own case: <q>They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance: and in Your name shall they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> all the day; and in Your righteousness shall they be exalted: for You are the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their strength.</q>  Rightly enough is it said to such, <q>They shall cast you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>;</q> that is, they who <q>have a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q> because, <q><a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171520"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;10:2-3</a></span> they expel those who are exalted, not in their own righteousness, but in God's, and have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be ashamed at being expelled by men, since He is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their strength.</p>

<p>3. Finally, to what He had thus told them, He added the words: <q>But the hour comes, that whosoever kills you will think that he does God service: and these things will they do unto you, because they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor me.</q> That is to say, they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor His Son, to whom they think they will be doing service in slaying you. Words which the Lord added in the way of consolation to His own, who should be driven out of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. For it is in thus announcing beforehand what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> they would have to endure for their testimony in His behalf, that He said, <q>They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>.</q> Nor does He say, And the hour comes, that whosoever kills you will think that he does God service. What then? <q>But the hour comes:</q> just in the way He would have spoken, were He foretelling them of something good that would follow such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. What, then, does He mean by the words, <q>They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>: but the hour comes</q>? As if He would have gone on to say this: They, indeed, will scatter you, <em>but</em> I will gather you; or, They shall, indeed, scatter you, <em>but</em> the hour of your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> comes. What, then, has the word which He uses, <q> <em>but</em> the hour comes,</q> to do here, as if He were going on to promise them comfort after their tribulation, when apparently He ought rather to have said, in the form of continuous narration,  <em>And</em> the hour comes? But He said not, And it comes, although predicting the approach of one tribulation after another, instead of comfort after tribulation. Could it have been that such a separation from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> would so discompose them, that they would prefer to die, rather than remain in this life apart from the Jewish assemblies? Far surely would those be from such discomposure, who were seeking, not the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What, then, of the words, <q>They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>: but the hour comes;</q> when apparently He ought rather to have said, <em>And</em> the hour comes, <q>that whosoever kills you will think that he does God service</q>? For it is not even said, But the hour comes that they shall kill you, as if implying that their comfort for such a separation would be found in the death that would befall them; but <q>The hour comes,</q> He says, <q>that whosoever kills you will think that he does God service.</q> On the whole, I do not think He wished to convey any further meaning than that they might understand and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that they themselves would gain so many to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by being driven out of the Jewish congregations, that it would be found insufficient to expel them, and they would not suffer them to live for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of all being converted by their preaching to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and so turned away from the observance of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, as if it were the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For so ought we to understand the reference of His words to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when He said of them, <q>They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>.</q> For the witnesses, in other words, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were likewise slain by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: they, however, thought not that it was to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to their own false deities, that they were doing service when they so acted. But every Jew that slew the preachers of Christ reckoned that he was doing God serv ice; believing as he did that all who were converted to Christ were deserting the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For it was also by the same reasoning that they were incited to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Christ Himself: because their own words on this subject have also been put on record. You perceive that the whole world is gone after him:  <q>If we let him live, the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.</q> And those of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: <q>It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.</q>  And accordingly in this address He sought by His own example to stimulate His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to whom He had just been saying, <q>If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you;</q>  that as in slaying Him they thought they had done God a service, so also would it be in reference to them.</p>

<p>4. Such, then, is the meaning of these words: <q>They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>;</q> but have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of solitude: inasmuch as, when separated from their assembly, you will assemble so many in my name, that they, in very <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the temple, that was with them, and all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old law, should be deserted, will slay you: actually, in thus shedding your blood, full of the notion that they are doing God service. An illustration surely of the apostle's words, <q>They have a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note171525"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;10:2</a></span> when they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they are doing God service in slaying His servants. Appalling mistake! Is it thus you would please God by striking down the God-pleaser; and is the living temple of God by your blows laid level with the ground, that God's temple of stone may not be deserted? Accursed blindness! But it is in part that it has happened to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might come in: in part, I say, and not totally, has it happened. For not all, but only some of the branches have been broken off, that the wild olive might be ingrafted.  For just at the time when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, were speaking in the tongues of all nations, and performing many divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and scattering divine utterances on every side, Christ, even though slain, was so beloved, that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when expelled from the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, gathered into a congregation of their own a vast multitude of those very <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being left to solitude. <span class="stiki" id="note171527"><a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts&nbsp;ii.-iv</a></span> Whereupon, accordingly, the others, reprobate and blind, being inflamed with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and having a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and believing that they were doing God service, put them to death. But He, who was slain for them, gathered those together; just as He had also, before He was slain, instructed them in what was to happen, lest their minds, left <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and unprepared, should be cast into trouble by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, however transient, that were unexpected and unprovided for; but rather by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of them beforehand, and sustaining them with patience, might be led onward to everlasting blessing. For that such was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His making these announcements to them beforehand, is shown also by His words that followed: <q>But these things have I told you, that, when their time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</q> Their hour was an hour of darkness, a midnight hour. But the Lord commanded His loving-kindness in the daytime, and made them sing of it in the night:  when the Jewish night threw no confusion of darkness into the day of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, separated as it was from themselves; and when that which could slay the flesh had no power to darken their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>
