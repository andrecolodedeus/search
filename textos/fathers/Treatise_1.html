<h1>Treatise 1</h1>

<p><strong>On the Unity of the Church. </strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; On the Occasion of the Schism of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, to Keep Back from Him the Carthaginians, Who Already Were Not Averse to Him, on Account of Novatus and Some Other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> of His Church, Who Had Originated the Whole Disturbance, Cyprian Wrote This Treatise. And First of All, Fortifying Them Against the Deceits of These, He Exhorts Them to Constancy, and Instructs Them that Heresies Exist Because Christ, the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is Not Looked To, that the Common Commission First Entrusted to Peter is Contemned, and the One Church and the One Episcopate are Deserted. Then He Proves, as Well by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as by the Figures of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the Unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</span> </p>

<p>1. Since the Lord warns us, saying, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053056"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> and since He bids us to be simple to harmlessness, and yet with our simplicity to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, what else, beloved brethren, befits us, than to use foresight and watching with an anxious heart, both to perceive and to beware of the wiles of the crafty foe, that we, who have put on Christ the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, may not seem to be wanting in wisdom in the matter of providing for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? For it is not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> alone that is to be feared; nor those things which advance by open attack to overwhelm and cast down the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Caution is more easy where danger is manifest, and the mind is prepared beforehand for the contest when the adversary avows himself. The enemy is more to be feared and to be guarded against, when he creeps on us secretly; when, deceiving by the appearance of peace, he steals forward by hidden approaches, whence also he has received the name of the Serpent.  That is always his subtlety; that is his dark and stealthy artifice for circumventing man. Thus from (he very beginning of the world he deceived; and flattering with <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words, he misled inexperienced <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by an incautious credulity. Thus he endeavoured to tempt the Lord Himself: he secretly approached Him, as if he would creep on Him again, and deceive; yet he was understood, and beaten back, and therefore prostrated, because he was recognised and detected.</p>

<p>2. From which an example is given us to avoid the way of the old man, to stand in the footsteps of a conquering  Christ, that we may not again be incautiously turned back into the nets of death, but, foreseeing our danger, may possess the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> that we have received. But how can we possess <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, unless we keep those commands of Christ whereby death is driven out and overcome, when He Himself warns us, and says, <q>If you will enter into life, keep the commandments? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053059"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;19:17</a></span> And again: <q>If you do the things that I command you, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053060"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;14:15</a></span> Finally, these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> He calls strong and steadfast; these He declares to be founded in robust security upon the rock, established with immoveable and unshaken firmness, in opposition to all the tempests and hurricanes of the world. <q>Whosoever,</q> says He, <q>hears my words, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, that built his house upon a rock: the rain descended, the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053061"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24</a></span> We ought therefore to stand fast on His words, to learn and do whatever He both taught and did. But how can a man say that he believes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who does not do what Christ commanded him to do? Or whence shall he attain to the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who will not keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the commandment? He must of necessity waver and wander, and, caught away by a spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, like dust which is shaken by the wind, be blown about; and he will make no advance in his walk towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because he does not keep the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>3. But, beloved brethren, not only must we beware of what is open and manifest, but also of what deceives by the craft of subtle fraud. And what can be more crafty, or what more subtle, than for this enemy, detected and cast down by the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after light has come to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and saving rays have shone for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that the deaf might receive the hearing of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the blind might open their eyes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the weak might grow strong again with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> health, the lame might run to the church, the dumb might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with clear voices and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>&mdash; seeing his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> forsaken, and his lanes and his temples deserted by the numerous concourse of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>&mdash; to devise a new fraud, and under the very title of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name to deceive the incautious? He has invented <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms, whereby he might subvert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, might corrupt the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, might divide the unity.  Those whom he cannot keep in the darkness of the old way, he circumvents and deceives by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a new way. He snatches men from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself; and while they seem to themselves to have already approached to the light, and to have escaped the night of the world, he pours over them again, in their unconsciousness, new darkness; so that, although they do not stand firm with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with the observation and law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they still call themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and, walking in darkness, they think that they have the light, while the adversary is flattering and deceiving, who, according to the apostle's word, transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, and equips his ministers as if they were the ministers of righteousness, who maintain night instead of day, death for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, despair under the offer of hope, perfidy under the pretext of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, antichrist under the name of Christ; so that, while they feign things like the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they make void the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by their subtlety. This happens, beloved brethren, so long as we do not return to the source of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as we do not seek the head nor keep the teaching of the heavenly Master.</p>

<p>4. If any one consider and examine these things, there is no need for lengthened discussion and arguments. There is easy <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a short summary of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Lord speaks to Peter,  saying, <q>I say unto you, that you are Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; and whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q>  And again to the same He says, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, <q>Feed my sheep.</q>  And although to all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, He gives an equal power, and says, <q>As the Father has sent me, even so send I you: Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you remit, they shall be remitted unto him; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you retain, they shall be retained; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053066"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse21">John 20:21</a></span> yet, that He might set forth unity, He arranged by His authority the origin of that unity, as beginning from one. Assuredly the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were also the same as was Peter, endowed with a like partnership both of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and power; but the beginning proceeds from unity.  Which one Church, also, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Song of Songs designated in the person of our Lord, and says, <q>My dove, my spotless one, is but one. She is the only one of her mother, elect of her that bare her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053068"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song of Songs 6:9</a></span> Does he who does not hold this unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> think that he holds the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Does he who strives against and resists the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  trust that he is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when moreover the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> teaches the same thing, and sets forth the sacrament of unity, saying, <q>There is one body and one spirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053070"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse4">Ephesians 4:4</a></span></p>

<p>5. And this unity we ought firmly to hold and assert, especially those of us that are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who preside in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that we may also prove the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> itself to be one and undivided.  Let no one deceive the brotherhood by a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>: let no one corrupt the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by perfidious prevarication. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> is one, each part of which is held by each one for the whole.  The Church also is one, which is spread abroad far and wide into a multitude by an increase of fruitfulness. As there are many rays of the sun, but one light; and many branches of a tree, but one strength based in its tenacious root; and since from one spring flow many streams, although the multiplicity seems diffused in the liberality of an overflowing abundance, yet the unity is still preserved in the source. Separate a ray of the sun from its body of light, its unity does not allow a division of light; break a branch from a tree&mdash;when broken, it will not be able to bud; cut off the stream from its fountain, and that which is cut off dries up. Thus also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, shone over with the light of the Lord, sheds forth her rays over the whole world, yet it is one light which is everywhere diffused, nor is the unity of the body separated. Her fruitful abundance spreads her branches over the whole world. She broadly expands her rivers, liberally flowing, yet her head is one, her source one; and she is one mother, plentiful in the results of fruitfulness: from her womb we are born, by her milk we are nourished, by her spirit we are animated.</p>

<p>6. The spouse of Christ cannot be adulterous; she is uncorrupted and pure. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> one home; she guards with chaste modesty the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of one couch. She keeps us for God. She appoints the sons whom she has born for the kingdom. Whoever is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and is joined to an adulteress, is separated from the promises of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor can he who forsakes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> attain to the rewards of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He is a stranger; he is profane; he is an enemy. He can no longer have God for his Father, who has not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for his mother. If any one could escape who was outside the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, then he also may escape who shall be outside of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Lord warns, saying, <q>He who is not with me is against me, and he who gathers not with me scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053073"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew 12:30</a></span> He who breaks the peace and the concord of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, does so in opposition to Christ; he who gathers elsewhere than in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, scatters the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The Lord says, <q>I and the Father are one; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053074"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John 10:30</a></span> and again it is written of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>And these three are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053075"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse7">1 John 5:7</a></span> And does any one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this unity which thus comes from the divine strength and coheres in celestial <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, can be divided in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and can be separated by the parting asunder of opposing wills? He who does not hold this unity does not hold God's law, does not hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, does not hold life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>7. This sacrament of unity, this bond of a concord inseparably cohering, is set forth where in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the coat of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is not at all divided nor cut, but is received as an entire garment, and is possessed as an uninjured and undivided robe by those who cast lots concerning Christ's garment, who should rather put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> speaks, saying, <q>But of the coat, because it was not sewed, but woven from the top throughout, they said one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots whose it shall be.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053077"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse23">John 19:23-24</a></span> That coat bore with it an unity that came down from the top, that is, that came from heaven and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which was not to be at all rent by the receiver and the possessor, but without separation we obtain a whole and substantial entireness. He cannot possess the garment of Christ who parts and divides the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On the other hand, again, when at Solomon's death his kingdom and people were divided, Abijah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, meeting <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the king in the field, divided his garment into twelve sections, saying, <q>Take you ten pieces; for thus says the Lord, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give ten sceptres unto you; and two sceptres shall be unto him for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen to place my name there.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053078"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse31">1 Kings 11:31</a></span> As the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were divided, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Abijah rent his garment. But because Christ's people cannot be rent, His robe, woven and united throughout, is not divided by those who possess it; undivided, united, connected, it shows the coherent concord of our people who put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. By the sacrament and sign of His garment, He has declared the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>8. Who, then, is so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and faithless, who is so insane with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of discord, that either he should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the unity of God can be divided, or should dare to rend it&mdash; the garment of the Lord&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>? He Himself in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> warns us, and teaches, saying, <q>And there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053079"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John 10:16</a></span> And does any one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in one place there can be either many shepherds or many flocks? The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, moreover, urging upon us this same unity, beseeches and exhorts, saving, <q>I beseech you, brethren, by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053080"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 1:10</a></span> And again, he says, <q>Forbearing one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053081"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians 4:3</a></span> Do you think that you can stand and live if you withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, building for yourself other homes and a different dwelling, when it is said to Rahab, in whom was prefigured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <q>Your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all the house of your father, you shall gather unto you into your house; and it shall come to pass, whosoever shall go abroad beyond the door of your house, his blood shall be upon his own head? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053082"><a href="../bible/jos002.htm#verse19">Joshua 2:19</a></span> Also, the sacrament of the passover contains nothing else in the law of the Exodus than that the lamb which is slain in the figure of Christ should be eaten in one house. God speaks, saying, <q>In one house shall you eat it; you shall not send its flesh abroad from the house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053083"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse46">Exodus 12:46</a></span> The flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of the Lord, cannot be sent abroad, nor is there any other home to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> but the one Church. This home, this household  of unanimity, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> designates and points out in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, saying, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who makes men to dwell with one mind in a house.</q>  in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, men dwell with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and continue in concord and simplicity:</p>

<p>9. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came as a dove, a simple and joyous creature, not bitter with gall, not cruel in its bite, not violent with the rending of its claws, loving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> dwellings, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the association of one home; when they have young, bringing forth their young together; when they fly abroad, remaining in their flights by the side of one another, spending their life in mutual intercourse, acknowledging the concord of peace with the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of the beak, in all things fulfilling the law of unanimity. This is the simplicity that ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, this is the charity that ought to be attained, that so the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood may imitate the cloves, that their gentleness and meekness may be like the lambs and sheep. What does the fierceness of wolves do in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> breast? What the savageness of dogs, and the deadly venom of serpents, and the sanguinary cruelty of wild beasts? We are to be congratulated when such as these are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest they should lay waste the doves and sheep of Christ with their cruel and envenomed contagion. Bitterness cannot consist and be associated with sweetness, darkness with light, rain with clearness, battle with peace, barrenness with fertility, drought with springs, storm with tranquillity. Let none think that the good can depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The wind does not carry away the wheat, nor does the hurricane uproot the tree that is based on a solid root. The light straws are tossed about by the tempest, the feeble trees are overthrown by the onset of the whirlwind. The Apostle John execrates and severely assails these, when he says, <q>They went forth from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, surely they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053086"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1 John 2:19</a></span></p>

<p>10. Hence <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> not only have frequently been originated, but continue to be so; while the perverted mind has no peace&mdash; while a discordant faithlessness does not maintain unity. But the Lord permits and suffers these things to be, while the choice of one's own liberty remains, so that while the discrimination of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is testing our hearts and our minds, the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those that are approved may shine forth with manifest light. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> forewarns and says by the apostle, <q>It is needful also that there should be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053087"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 11:19</a></span> Thus the faithful are approved, thus the perfidious are detected; thus even here, before the day of judgment, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous and of the unrighteous are already divided, and the chaff is separated from the wheat. These are they who of their own accord, without any divine arrangement, set themselves to preside among the daring strangers assembled, who appoint themselves prelates without any law of ordination, who assume to themselves the name of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, although no one gives them the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>; whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> points out in the Psalms as sitting in the seat of pestilence, plagues, and spots of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, deceiving with serpent's tongue, and artful in corrupting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, vomiting forth deadly poisons from pestilential tongues; whose speech does creep like a cancer, whose discourse forms a deadly poison in the heart and breast of every one.</p>

<p>11. Against people of this kind the Lord cries; from these He restrains and recalls His erring people, saying, <q>Hearken not unto the words of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>; for the visions of their hearts deceive them. They speak, but not out of the mouth of the Lord. They say to those who cast away the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You shall have peace, and every one that walks after his own will. Every one who walks in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his heart, no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall come upon him. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. If they had stood on my foundation (<em>substantia</em>, <span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;<!--k29--'&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>), and had heard my words, and taught my people, I would have turned them from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053088"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 23:16-21</a></span> Again, the Lord points out and designates these same, saying, <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have hewed them out broken cisterns which can hold no water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053089"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 2:13</a></span> Although there can be no other <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> but one, they think that they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>; although they forsake the fountain of life, they promise the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of living and saving water. Men are not washed among them, but rather are made foul; nor are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> purged away, but are even accumulated. Such a nativity does not generate sons to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> they are born, and they do not receive the promises of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Begotten of perfidy, they lose the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They cannot attain to the reward of peace, since they have broken the Lord's peace with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of discord.</p>

<p>12. Nor let any deceive themselves by a futile interpretation, in respect of the Lord having said, <q>Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053090"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a></span> Corrupters and false interpreters of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> quote the last words, and lay aside the former ones, remembering part, and craftily suppressing part: as they themselves are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so they cut off the substance of one section. For the Lord, when He would urge unanimity and peace upon His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said, <q>I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth touching anything that you shall ask, it shall be given you by my Father which is in heaven. For wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them; </q>  showing that most is given, not to the multitude, but to the unanimity of those that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. <q>If,</q> He says, <q>two of you shall agree on earth: </q>He placed agreement first; He has made the concord of peace a prerequisite; He taught that we should agree firmly and faithfully. But how can he agree with any one who does not agree with the booty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, and with the universal brotherhood? How can two or three be assembled together in Christ's name, who, it is evident, are separated from Christ and from His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? For we have not withdrawn from them, but they from us; and since <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms have risen subsequently, from their establishment for themselves of diverse places of worship, they have forsaken the Head and Source of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the Lord speaks concerning His Church, and to those also who are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> He speaks, that if they are in agreement, if according to what He commanded and admonished, although only two or three gathered together with unanimity should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>&mdash; though they be only two or three&mdash; they may obtain from the majesty of God what they ask. <q>Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, I,</q> slays He, <q>am with them; </q>that is, with the simple and peaceable&mdash; with those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God and keep God's commandments. With these, although only two or three, He said that He was, in the same manner as He was with the three youths in the fiery furnace; and because they abode towards God in simplicity, and in unanimity among themselves, He animated them, in the midst of the surrounding flames, with the breath of dew: in the way in which, with the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, because they were simple-minded and of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, He Himself was present; He Himself, having loosed the bolts of the dungeon, placed them again in the market-place, that they might declare to the multitude the word which they faithfully preached. When, therefore, in His commandments He lays it down, and says, <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them,</q> He does not divide men from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, seeing that He Himself ordained and made the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but rebuking the faithless for their discord, and commending peace by His word to the faithful, He shows that He is rather with two or three who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, than with a great many who differ, and that more can be obtained by the discordant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of a few, than by the discordant supplication of many.</p>

<p>13. Thus, also, when He gave the law of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, He added, saying, <q>And when you stand <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, forgive, if you have ought against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</q>  And He calls back from the altar one who comes to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in strife, and bids him first agree with his brother, and then return with peace and offer his gift to God: for God had not respect unto Cain's offerings; for he could not have God at peace with him, who through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> discord had not peace with his brother. What peace, then, do the enemies of the brethren promise to themselves? What <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> do those who are rivals of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> think that they celebrate? Do they deem that they have Christ with them when they are collected together, who are gathered together outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>?</p>

<p>14. Even if such men were slain in confession of the Name, that stain is not even washed away by blood: the inexpiable and grave fault of discord is not even purged by suffering. He cannot be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> who is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he cannot attain unto the kingdom who forsakes that which shall reign there. Christ gave us peace; He bade us be in agreement, and of one mind. He charged the bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and charity to be kept uncorrupted and inviolate; he cannot show himself a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> who has not maintained brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle teaches this, and testifies, saying, <q>And though I have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I can remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I give all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing. Charity is magnanimous; charity is kind; charity envies not; charity acts not vainly, is not puffed up, is not easily provoked, thinks no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; loves all things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> all things, hopes all things, endures all things Charity never falls.</q>  <q>Charity,</q> says he, <q>never fails.</q> For she will ever be in the kingdom, she will endure for ever in the unity of a brotherhood linked to herself. Discord cannot attain to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; to the rewards of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who said, <q>This is my commandment that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another even as I have loved you: </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053094"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse12">John 15:12</a></span> he cannot attain  who has violated the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ b faithless dissension. He who has not charity has not God. The word of the blessed Apostle John is: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and he that dwells in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God dwells in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053096"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1 John 4:16</a></span> They cannot dwell with God who would not be of one mind in God's Church. Although they burn, given up to flames and fires, or lay down their lives, thrown to the wild beasts, that will not be the crown of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the punishment of perfidy; nor will it be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> ending of religious valour, but the destruction of despair. Such a one may be slain; crowned he cannot be. He professes himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in such a way as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> often feigns himself to be Christ, as the Lord Himself forewarns us, and says, <q>Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053097"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse6">Mark 13:6</a></span> As he is not Christ, although he deceives in respect of the name; so neither can he appear as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who does not abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>15. For both to prophesy and to cast out devils, and to do great acts upon the earth is certainly a sublime and an admirable thing; but one does not attain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> although he is found in all these things, unless he walks in the observance of the right and just way. The Lord denounces, and says, <q>Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, and in Your name have cast out devils, and in Your name done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>? And then will I profess unto them, I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053098"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22</a></span> There is need of righteousness, that one may deserve well of God the Judge; we must <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His precepts and warnings, that our merits may receive their reward. The Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when He would direct the way of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a brief summary, said, <q>The Lord your God is one God: and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment; land the second is like it: You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053099"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse29">Mark 12:29-31</a></span> He taught, at the same time, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and unity by His instruction. He has included all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the law in two precepts. But what unity does he keep, what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> does he maintain or consider, who, savage with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of discord, divides the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, destroys the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I disturbs the peace, dissipates charity, profanes the sacrament?</p>

<p>16. This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, most faithful brethren, had long ago begun, but now the mischievous destruction of the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has increased, and the envenomed plague of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity and schisms has begun to spring forth and shoot anew; because even thus it must be in the decline of the world, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> foretells and forewarns us by the apostle, saying, <q>In the last days,</q> says he, <q>perilous times shall come, and men shall be lovers of their own selves, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, boasters, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, disobedient to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, unthankful, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, hating the good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having a sort of form  of religion, but denying the power thereof. Of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are led away with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; ever learning, and never coming to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And as Jannes and Jambres withstood <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so do these also resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;  but they shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be manifest unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even as theirs also was.</q>  Whatever things were predicted are fulfilled; and as the end of the world is approaching, they have come for the probation as well of the men as of the times. Error deceives as the adversary rages more and more; senselessness lifts up, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> inflames, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> makes blind, impiety depraves, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> puffs up, discord exasperates, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> hurries headlong.</p>

<p>17. Yet let not the excessive and headlong faithlessness of many move or disturb us, but rather strengthen our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> which has foretold the matter. As some have become such, because these things were predicted beforehand, so let other brethren beware of matters of a like kind, because these also were predicted beforehand, even as the Lord instructs us, and says, <q>But take heed: behold, I have told you all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053103"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse23">Mark 13:23</a></span> Avoid, I beseech you, brethren, men of this kind, and drive away from your side and from your ears, as if it were the contagion of death, their mischievous conversation; as it is written, <q>Hedge your ears about with thorns, and refuse to hear a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tongue.</q>  And again, <q>Evil communications corrupt good manners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053105"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 15:33</a></span> The Lord teaches and warns us to depart from such. He says, <q>They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053106"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew 15:14</a></span> Such a one is to be turned away from and avoided, whosoever he may be, that is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such a one is perverted and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is condemned of his own self. Does he think that he has Christ, who acts in opposition to Christ's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who separates himself from the company of His <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people? He bears arms against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he contends against God's appointment. An enemy of the altar, a rebel against Christ's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> faithless, for religion profane, a disobedient servant, an impious son, a hostile brother, despising the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and forsaking God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he dares to set up another altar, to make another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with unauthorized words, to profane the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Lord's offering by false <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and not  to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he who strives against the appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is punished on account of the daring of his temerity by divine visitation.</p>

<p>18. Thus Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who endeavoured to claim to themselves the power of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, underwent immediate punishment for their attempts. The earth, breaking its fastenings, gaped open into a deep gulf, and the cleft of the receding ground swallowed up the men standing and living. Nor did the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the indignant God strike only those who had been the movers (of the sedition); but two hundred and fifty sharers and associates of that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> besides, who had been mingled with them in that boldness, the fire that went out from the Lord consumed with a hasty revenge; doubtless to admonish and show that whatever those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men had endeavoured, in order by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will to overthrow God's appointment, had been done in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus also Uzziah the king&mdash;when he bare the censer and violently claimed to himself to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> against God's law, and when Azariah the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> withstood him, would not be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and yield&mdash;was confounded by the divine indignation, and was polluted upon his forehead by the spot of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>: he was marked by an offended Lord in that part of his body where they are signed who deserve well of the Lord. And the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, who placed strange fire upon the altar, which the Lord had not commanded, were at once extinguished in the presence of an avenging Lord.</p>

<p>19. These, doubtless, they imitate and follow, who, despising God's tradition, seek after <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>, and bring in teachings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> appointment, whom the Lord rebukes and reproves in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>You reject the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may keep your own tradition.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053108"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse9">Mark 7:9</a></span> This is a worse crime than that which the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> seem to have fallen into, who nevertheless, standing as penitents for their crime, beseech God with full satisfactions. In this case, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is sought after and entreated; in that case, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is resisted: here it is possible that there has been necessity; there the will is engaged in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: on the one hand, he who has lapsed has only injured himself; on the other, he who has endeavoured to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> has deceived many by drawing them with him. In the former, it is the loss of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; in the latter, the risk of many. Certainly the one both understands that he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and laments and bewails it; the other, puffed up in his heart, and pleasing himself in his very crimes, separates sons from their Mother, entices sheep from their shepherd, disturbs the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and while the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> but once, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> daily. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, who has subsequently attained to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, may receive the promises of the kingdom; while the other, if he have been slain without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cannot attain to the rewards of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>20. Nor let any one marvel, beloved brethren, that even some of the confessors advance to these lengths, and thence also that some <em>others</em> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> thus wickedly, thus grievously. For neither does confession make a man free from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, nor does it defend a man who is still placed in the world, with a perpetual security from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and dangers, and onsets, and attacks of the world; otherwise we should never see in confessors those subsequent frauds, and fornications, and adulteries, which now with groans and sorrow we <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in some. Whosoever that confessor is, he is not greater, or better, or dearer to God than Solomon, who, although so long as he walked in God's ways, retained that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which he had received from the Lord, yet after he forsook the Lord's way he lost also then Lord's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.  And therefore it is written, <q>Hold fast that which you have, lest another take your crown.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053110"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse11">Revelation 3:11</a></span> But assuredly the Lord would not threaten that the crown of righteousness might be taken away, were it not that, when righteousness departs, the crown must also depart.</p>

<p>21. Confession is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not the full desert of the crown; nor does it perfect our praise, but it initiates our dignity; and since it is written, <q>He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053111"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew 10:22</a></span> whatever has been before the end is a step by which we ascend to the summit of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not a terminus wherein the full result of the ascent is already gained. He is a confessor; but after confession his peril is greater, because the adversary is more provoked. He is a confessor; for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he ought the more to stand on the side of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, since he has by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> attained <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the Lord. For the Lord says, <q>To whom much is given, of him much shall be required; and to whom more dignity is ascribed, of him more service is exacted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053112"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse48">Luke 12:48</a></span> Let no one perish by the example of a confessor; let no one learn <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, let no one learn arrogance, let no one learn treachery, from the manners of a confessor. He is a confessor, let him be lowly and quiet; let him be in his doings modest with discipline, so that he who is called a confessor of Christ may imitate Christ whom he confesses. For since He says, <q>Whosoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053113"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke 18:14</a></span> and since He Himself has been exalted by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because as the Word, and the strength, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He humbled Himself upon earth, how can He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> arrogance, who even by His own law enjoined upon us humility, and Himself received the highest name from the Father as the reward of His humility? He is a confessor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only so if the majesty and dignity of Christ be not afterwards <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> by him. Let not the tongue which has confessed Christ be evil-speaking; let it not be turbulent, let it not be heard jarring with reproaches and quarrels, let it not after words of praise, dart forth serpents' venom against the brethren and God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But if one shall have subsequently been blameworthy and obnoxious; if he shall have wasted his confession by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conversation; if he shall have stained his life by disgraceful foulness; if, finally, forsaking the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which he has become a confessor, and severing the concord of unity, he shall have exchanged his first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for a subsequent unbelief, he may not flatter himself on account of his confession that he is elected to the reward of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when from this very fact his deserving of punishment has become the greater.</p>

<p>22. For the Lord chose Judas also among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and yet afterwards Judas betrayed the Lord. Yet not on that account did the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and firmness of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> fail, because the traitor Judas failed from their fellowship: so also in the case in question the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and dignity of confessors is not immediately diminished, because the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some of them is broken. The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in his epistle speaks in this manner: <q>For what if some of them fall away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, shall their unbelief make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God without effect? God forbid: for God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, though every man be a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053114"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3</a></span> The greater and better part of the confessors stand firm in the strength of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the law and discipline of the Lord; neither do they depart from the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who remember that they have obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and by this very thing they obtain a higher praise of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they have separated from the faithlessness of those who have been associated with them in the fellowship of confession, and withdrawn from the contagion of crime. Illuminated by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, shone upon with the Lord's pure and white brightness, they are as praiseworthy in maintaining the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as they have been victorious in their combat with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>23. I indeed desire, beloved brethren, and I equally endeavour and exhort, that if it be possible, none of the brethren should perish, and that our rejoicing Mother may enclose in her bosom the one body of a people at agreement. Yet if wholesome counsel cannot recall to the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> certain leaders of schisms and originators of dissensions, who abide in blind and obstinate <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, yet do you others, if either taken in simplicity, or induced by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or deceived by some craftiness of misleading cunning, loose yourselves from the nets of deceit, free your wandering steps from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, acknowledge the straight way of the heavenly road. The word of the witnessing apostle is: <q>We command you,</q> says he, <q>in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that you withdraw yourselves from all brethren that walk disorderly, and not after the tradition that they have received from us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053115"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a></span> And again he says, <q>Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things comes the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not therefore partakers with them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053116"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse6">Ephesians 5:6</a></span> We must withdraw, nay rather must flee, from those who fall away, lest, while any one is associated with those who walk wickedly, and goes on in ways of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he himself also, wandering away from the path of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> road, should be found in like guilt. God is one, and Christ is one, and His Church is one, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one, and the people  is joined into a substantial unity of body by the cement of concord. Unity cannot be severed; nor can one body be separated by a division of its structure, nor torn into pieces, with its entrails wrenched asunder by laceration. Whatever has proceeded from the womb cannot live and breathe in its detached condition, but loses the substance of health.</p>

<p>24. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> warns us, and says, <q>What man is he that desires to live, and would fain see good days? Refrain your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips that they speak no guile. Eschew <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good; seek peace, and ensue it.</q>  The son of peace ought to seek peace and ensue it. He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves the bond of charity, ought to refrain his tongue from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of dissension. Among His divine commands and salutary teachings, the Lord, when He was now very near to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, added this one, saying, <q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053119"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John 14:27</a></span> He gave this to us as an heritage; He promised all the gifts and rewards of which He spoke through the preservation of peace. If we are fellow-heirs with Christ, let us abide in the peace of Christ; if we are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought to be peacemakers. <q>Blessed,</q> says He, <q>are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053120"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew 5:9</a></span> It behooves the sons of God to be peacemakers, gentle in heart, simple in speech, agreeing in affection, faithfully linked to one another in the bonds of unanimity.</p>

<p>25. This unanimity formerly prevailed among the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and thus the new assembly of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, keeping the Lord's commandments, maintained its charity. Divine Scripture proves this, when it says, <q>But the multitude of them which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And again: <q>These all continued with one mind in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and Mary the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and with His brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053122"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse14">Acts 1:14</a></span> And thus  they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with effectual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; thus they were able with confidence to obtain whatever they asked from the Lord's mercy.</p>

<p>26. But in us unanimity is diminished in proportion as liberality of working is decayed. Then they used to give for sale houses and estates; and that they might lay up for themselves treasures in heaven, presented to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the price of them, to be distributed for the use of the poor. But now we do not even give the tenths from our patrimony; and while our Lord bids us sell, we rather buy and increase our store. Thus has the vigour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> dwindled away among us; thus has the strength of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> grown weak. And therefore the Lord, looking to our days, says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes, think you that He shall find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053124"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke 18:8</a></span> We see that what He foretold has come to pass. There is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the law of righteousness, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in labour; none considers the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of futurity, and none takes to heart the day of the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the punishments to come upon unbelievers, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> torments decreed for the faithless. That which our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> would <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> if it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, it fears not because it does not at all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But if it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, it would also take heed; and if it took heed, it would escape.</p>

<p>27. Let us, beloved brethren, arouse ourselves as much as we can; and breaking the slumber of our ancient listlessness, let us be watchful to observe and to do the Lord's precepts. Let us be such as He Himself has bidden us to be, saying, <q>Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning;  and you yourselves like men that wait for their Lord, when He shall come from the wedding, that when He comes and knocks, they may open to Him. Blessed are those servants whom their Lord, when He comes, shall find watching.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053126"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke 12:35</a></span> We ought to be girt about, lest, when the day of setting forth comes, it should find us burdened and entangled. Let our light shine in good works, and glow in such wise as to lead us from the night of this world to the daylight of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> brightness. Let us always with solicitude and caution wait for the sudden coming of the Lord, that when He shall knock, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be on the watch, and receive from the Lord the reward of our vigilance. If these commands be observed, if these warnings and precepts be kept, we cannot be overtaken in slumber by the deceit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; but we shall reign with Christ in His kingdom as servants that watch.</p>
