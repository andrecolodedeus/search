<h1>Treatise 10</h1>

 <p><strong>On Jealousy and Envy.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Argument.</span>  <span class="sc">&mdash; After Pointing Out that Jealousy or Envy is a Sin All the More Heinous in Proportion as Its Wickedness is Hidden, and that Its Origin is to Be Traced to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, He Gives Illustrations of Envy from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and Gathers, by Reference to Special Vices, that Envy is the Root of All Wickedness. Therefore with Reason Was Fraternal Hatred Forbidden Not in One Place Only, But by Christ and His Apostles. Finally, Exhorting to the Love of One's Enemies by God's Example, He Dissuades from the Sin of Envy, by Urging the Rewards Set Before the Indulgence of Love.</span> </p>

<p>1. To be jealous of what you see to be good, and to be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of those who are better than yourself, seems, beloved brethren, in the eyes of some people to be a slight and petty wrong; and, being thought trifling and of small account, it is not feared; not being feared, it is contemned; being contemned, it is not easily shunned: and it thus becomes a dark and hidden mischief, which, as it is not perceived so as to be guarded against by the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, secretly distresses incautious minds. But, moreover, the Lord bade us be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and charged us to watch with careful solicitude, lest the adversary, who is always on the watch and always lying in wait, should creep stealthily into our breast, and blow up a flame from the sparks, magnifying small things into the greatest; and so, while soothing the unguarded and careless with a milder air and a softer breeze, should stir up storms and whirlwinds, and bring about the destruction of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the shipwreck of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of life. Therefore, beloved brethren, we must be on our guard, and strive with all our powers to repel, with solicitous and full watch-fullness, the enemy, raging and aiming his darts against every part of our body in which we can be stricken and wounded, in accordance with what the Apostle Peter, in his epistle, forewarns and teaches, saying, <q>Be sober, and watch; because your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking any one to devour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053588"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>

<p>2. He goes about every one of us; and even as an enemy besieging those who are shut up (in a city), he examines the walls, and tries whether there is any part of the walls  less firm and less trustworthy, by entrance through which he may penetrate to the inside. He presents to the eyes seductive forms and easy pleasures, that he may destroy <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> by the sight. He tempts the ears with harmonious music, that by the hearing of sweet sounds he may relax and enervate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> vigour.  He provokes the tongue by reproaches; he instigates the hand by exasperating wrongs to the wrecklessness of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; to make the cheat, he presents dishonest gains; to take captive the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by money, he heaps together mischievous hoards; he promises earthly honours, that he may deprive of heavenly ones; he makes a show of false things, that he may steal away the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and when he cannot hiddenly deceive, he threatens plainly and openly, holding forth the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of turbulent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to vanquish God's servants&mdash; always restless, and always hostile, crafty in peace, and fierce in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</p>

<p>3. Wherefore, beloved brethren, against all the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> deceiving snares or open threatenings, the mind ought to stand arrayed and armed, ever as ready to repel as the foe is ever ready to attack. And since those darts of his which creep on us in concealment are more frequent, and his more hidden and secret hurling of them is the more severely and frequently effectual to our wounding, in proportion as it is the less perceived, let us also be watchful to understand and repel these, among which is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of jealousy and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. And if any one closely look into this, be will find that nothing should be more guarded against by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, nothing more carefully watched, than being taken captive by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, that none, entangled in the blind snares of a deceitful enemy, in that the brother is turned by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his brother, should himself be unwittingly destroyed by his own sword. That we may be able more fully to collect and more plainly to perceive this, let us recur to its fount and origin. Let us consider whence arises jealousy, and when and how it begins. For so mischievous an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will be more easily shunned by us, if both the source and the magnitude of that same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. </p>

<p>4. From this source, even at the very beginnings of the world, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was the first who both perished (himself) and destroyed (others). He who  was sustained in angelic majesty, he who was accepted and beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he beheld man made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, broke forth into jealousy with malevolent <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>&mdash; not hurling down another by the instinct of his jealousy before he himself was first hurled down by jealousy, captive before he takes captive, ruined before he ruins others. While, at the instigation of jealousy, he robs man of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> conferred, he himself has lost that which he had previously been. How great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is that, beloved brethren, whereby an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> fell, whereby that lofty and illustrious grandeur could be defrauded and overthrown, whereby he who deceived was himself deceived! Thenceforth <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> rages on the earth, in that he who is about to perish by jealousy obeys the author of his ruin, imitating the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in his jealousy; as it is written, <q>But through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> death entered into the world.</q>  Therefore they who are on his side imitate him. </p>

<p>5. Hence, in fine, began the primal hatreds of the new brotherhood, hence the abominable fratricides, in that the unrighteous Cain is jealous of the righteous Abel, in that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> persecutes the good with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and jealousy. So far prevailed the rage of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> to the consummation of that deed of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that neither the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his brother, nor the immensity of the crime, nor the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was considered.  He was unrighteously stricken who had been the first to show righteousness; he endured <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> who had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; he was impiously slain, who, dying, did not resist. And that <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> was hostile to his brother Jacob, arose from jealousy also. For because the latter had received his father's blessing, the former was inflamed to a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> by the brands of jealousy. And that Joseph was sold by his brethren, the reason of their selling him proceeded from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. When in simplicity, and as a brother to brethren, he set forth to them the prosperity which had been shown to him in visions, their malevolent disposition broke forth into <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Moreover, that Saul the king <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> David, so as to seek by often repeated <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> to kill him&mdash; innocent, merciful, gentle, patient in meekness&mdash; what else was the provocation save the spur of jealousy? Because, when Goliath was slain, and by the aid and condescension of God so great an enemy was routed, the wondering people burst forth with the suffrage of acclamation into praises of David, Saul through jealousy conceived the rage of enmity and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. And, not to go to the length of numbering each one, let us observe the destruction of a people that perished once for all.  Did not the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> perish for this reason, that they chose rather to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> Christ  than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him? Disparaging those great works which He did, they were deceived by blinding jealousy, and could not open the eyes of their heart to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things.</p>

<p>6. Considering which things, beloved brethren, let us with vigilance and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> fortify our hearts dedicated to God against such a destructiveness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Let the death of others avail for our safety; let the punishment of the unwise confer health upon the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. Moreover, there is no ground for any one to suppose that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of that kind is confined in one form, or restrained within brief limits in a narrow boundary. The mischief of jealousy, manifold and fruitful, extends widely. It is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, the fountain of disasters, the nursery of crimes, the material of transgressions. Thence arises <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, thence proceeds animosity. Jealousy inflames <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, in that one cannot be content with what is his own, while he sees another more <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>. Jealousy stirs up ambition, when one sees another more exalted in honours.  When jealousy darkens our perceptions, and reduces the secret agencies of the mind under its command, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God is despised, the teaching of Christ is neglected, the day of judgment is not anticipated. Pride inflates, cruelty embitters, faithlessness prevaricates, impatience agitates, discord rages, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grows hot; nor can he who has become the subject of a foreign authority any longer restrain or govern himself. By this the bond of the Lord's peace is broken; by this is violated brotherly charity; by this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is adulterated, unity is divided; men plunge into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms when <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are disparaged, when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are envied, when a man complains that he himself was not rather ordained, or disdains to suffer that another should be put over him.  Hence the man who is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> through jealousy, and perverse through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, kicks, hence he revolts, in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> the opponent, not of the man, but of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>7. But what a gnawing worm of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is it, what a plague-spot of our thoughts, what a rust of the heart, to be jealous of another, either in respect of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; that is, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in him either his own deservings or the divine benefits&mdash; to turn the advantages of others into one's own mischief&mdash; to be tormented by the prosperity of illustrious men&mdash; to make other people's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> one's own penalty, and, as it were, to apply a sort of executioner to one's own breast, to bring the tormentors to one's own thoughts and feelings, that they may tear us with intestine pangs, and may smite the secret recesses of the heart with the hoof of malevolence. To such, no food is joyous, no drink can be cheerful. They are ever sighing, and groaning, and grieving; and since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is never put off by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, the possessed heart is rent without intermission day and night. Other ills have their limit; and whatever wrong is done, is bounded by the completion of the crime. In the adulterer the offense ceases when the violation is perpetrated; in the case of the robber, the crime is at rest when the homicide is committed; and the possession of the booty puts an end to the rapacity of the thief; and the completed deception places a limit to the wrong of the cheat. Jealousy has no limit; it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> continually enduring, and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without end. In proportion as he who is envied has the advantage of a greater success, in that proportion the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man burns with the fires of jealousy to an increased heat. </p>

<p>8. Hence the threatening countenance, the lowering aspect, pallor in the face, trembling on the lips, gnashing of the teeth, mad words, unbridled revilings, a hand prompt for the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of slaughter; even if for the time deprived of a sword, yet armed with the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of an infuriate mind. And accordingly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says in the Psalms: <q>Be not jealous against him who walks prosperously in his way.</q>  And again: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall observe the righteous, and shall gnash upon him with his teeth. But God shall laugh at him; for He sees that his day is coming.</q>  The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> designates and points out these when he says, <q>The poison of asps is under their lips, and their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways, who have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of peace; neither is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God before their eyes.</q> </p>

<p>9. The mischief is much more trifling, and the danger less, when the limbs are wounded with a sword. The cure is easy where the wound is manifest; and when the medicament is applied, the sore that  is seen is quickly brought to health. The wounds of jealousy are hidden and secret; nor do they admit the remedy of a healing cure, since they have shut themselves in blind suffering within the lurking-places of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Whoever you are that are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malignant, observe how crafty, mischievous, and hateful you are to those whom you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Yet you are the enemy of no one's well-being more than your own. Whoever he is whom you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> with jealousy, can evade and escape you. You cannot escape yourself.  Wherever you may be, your adversary is with you; your enemy is always in your own breast; your mischief is shut up within; you are tied and bound with the links of chains from which you cannot extricate yourself; you are captive under the tyranny of jealousy; nor will any consolations help you. It is a persistent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> a man who belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is a calamity without remedy to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</p>

<p>10. And therefore, beloved brethren, the Lord, taking thought for this risk, that none should fall into the snare of death through jealousy of his brother, when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked Him which among them should be the greatest, said, <q>Who soever shall be least among you all, the same shall be great.</q>  He cut off all <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> by His reply.  He plucked out and tore away every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and matter of gnawing <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. A <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Christ must not be jealous, must not be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>. With us there can be no contest for exaltation; from humility we grow to the highest attainments; we have learned in what way we may be pleasing. And finally, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, instructing and warning, that we who, illuminated by the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have escaped from the darkness of the conversation of night, should walk in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and works of light, writes and says, <q>The night has passed over, and the day is approaching: let us therefore cast away the works of darkness, and let us put upon us the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, not in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and wantonness, not in strifes and jealousy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053608"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans 13:12-13</a></span> If the darkness has departed from your breast, if the night is scattered therefrom, if the gloom is chased away, if the brightness of day has illuminated your senses, if you have begun to be a man of light, do those things which are Christ's, because Christ is the Light and the Day.</p>

<p>11. Why do you rush into the darkness of jealousy? Why do you enfold yourself in the cloud of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>? Why do you quench all the light of peace and charity in the blindness of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>? Why do you return to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whom you had renounced? Why do you stand like Cain? For that he who is jealous of his brother, and has him in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, is bound by the guilt of homicide, the Apostle John declares in his epistle, saying, <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer; and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no murderer has life abiding in him.</q>  And again: <q>He that says he is in the light, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, is in darkness even until now, and walks in darkness, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whither he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053610"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1 John 2:9-11</a></span> Whosoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, says he, his brother, walks in darkness, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whither he goes. For he goes unconsciously to Gehenna, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and blindness; he is hurrying into punishment, departing, that is, from the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who warns and says, <q>I am the light of the world. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053611"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John 8:12</a></span> But he follows Christ who stands in His precepts, who walks in the way of His teaching, who follows His footsteps and His ways, who imitates that which Christ both did and taught; in accordance with what Peter also exhorts and warns, saying, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow His steps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053612"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1 Peter 2:21</a></span></p>

<p>12. We ought to remember by what name Christ calls His people, by what title He names His flock. He calls them sheep, that their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> innocence may be like that of sheep; He calls them lambs, that their simplicity of mind may imitate the simple nature of lambs. Why does the wolf lurk under the garb of sheep? Why does he who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> asserts himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, dishonour the flock of Christ? To put on the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not to go in the way of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what else is it but a mockery of the divine name, but a desertion of the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; since He Himself teaches and says that he shall come unto life who keeps His commandments, and that he is wise who hears and does His words; that he, moreover, is called the greatest doctor in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> who thus does and teaches;  that, then, will be of advantage to the preacher what has been well and usefully preached, if what is uttered by his mouth is fulfilled by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> following? But what did the Lord more frequently instil into His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, what did He more charge to be guarded and observed among His saving counsels and heavenly precepts, than that with the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He Himself loved the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, we also should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another? And in what manner does he keep either the peace or the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord, who, when jealousy intrudes, can neither be peaceable nor loving?</p>

<p>13. Thus also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when he was urging the merits of peace and charity, and when he was strongly asserting and teaching that neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, nor even the passion itself of the confessor and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>,  would avail him, unless he kept the requirements of charity entire and inviolate, added, and said: <q>Charity, is magnanimous, charity is kind, charity envies not; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053615"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a></span> teaching, doubtless, and showing that whoever is magnanimous, and kind, and averse from jealousy and rancour, such a one can maintain charity. Moreover, in another place, when he was advising that the man who has already become filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and a son of God by heavenly birth, should observe nothing but spiritual and divine things, he lays it down, and says: <q>And I indeed, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have fed you with milk, not with meat:  for you were not able hitherto; moreover, neither now are you able. For you are yet carnal: for whereas there are still among you jealousy, and contention, and strifes, are you not carnal, and walk as men? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053617"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 3:1-3</a></span></p>

<p>14. Vices and carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must be trampled down, beloved brethren, and the corrupting plague of the earthly body must be trodden under foot with spiritual vigour, lest, while we are turned back again to the conversation of the old man, we be entangled in deadly snares, even as the apostle, with foresight and wholesomeness, forewarned us of this very thing, and said: <q>Therefore, brethren, let us not live after the flesh; for if you live after the flesh, you shall begin to die; but if you, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, you shall live. For as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053618"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse12">Romans 8:12-14</a></span> If we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we are already beginning to be His temples, if, having received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we are living holily and spiritually, if we have raised our eyes from earth to heaven, if we have lifted our hearts, filled with God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to things above and divine, let us do nothing but what is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as the apostle arouses and exhorts us, saying: <q>If you be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; occupy your minds with things that are above, not with things which are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053619"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians 3:1-4</a></span> Let us, then, who in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have both died and been buried in respect of the carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the old man, who have risen again with Christ in the heavenly regeneration, both think upon and do the things which are Christ's, even as the same apostle again teaches and counsels, saying: <q>The first man is of the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven. Such as he is from the earth, such also are they who are from the earth and such as He the heavenly is, such also are they who are heavenly. As we have borne the image of him who is of the earth, let us also bear the image of Him who is from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053620"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1 Corinthians 15:47-49</a></span> But we cannot bear the heavenly image, unless in that condition wherein we have already begun to be, we show forth the likeness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>15. For this is to change what you had been, and to begin to be what you were not, that the divine birth might shine forth in you, that the godly discipline might respond to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and praise of living, God may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in man; as He Himself exhorts, and warns, and promises to those who glorify Him a reward in their turn, saying, <q>Them that glorify me I will glorify, and he who despises me shall be despised.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053621"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse30">1 Samuel 2:30</a></span> For which glorification the Lord, forming and preparing us, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> instilling  the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>You have heard that it has been said, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them which <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you; that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, who makes His sun to rise on the good and on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and sends rain upon the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053623"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse43">Matthew 5:43-45</a></span> If it is a source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to men to have children like to themselves&mdash; and it is more agreeable to have begotten an offspring then when the remaining  progeny responds to the parent with like lineaments&mdash; how much greater is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when any one is so spiritually born that in his acts and praises the divine eminence of race  is announced! What a palm of righteousness is it, what a crown to be such a one  as that the Lord should not say of you, <q>I have begotten and brought up children, but they have despised me!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053627"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah 1:2</a></span> Let Christ rather applaud you, and invite you to the reward, saying, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which is prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053628"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34</a></span></p>

<p>16. The mind must be strengthened, beloved brethren, by these meditations. By exercises of this kind it must be confirmed against all the darts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Let there be the divine reading in the hands,  the Lord's thoughts in the mind; let constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> never cease at all; let saving labour persevere. Let us be always busied in spiritual actions, that so often as the enemy approaches, however often he may try to come near, he may find the breast closed and armed against him. For a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man's crown is not only that which is received in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>: peace  also has its crowns, wherewith the victors, from a varied and manifold engagement, are crowned, when their adversary is prostrated and subdued. To have overcome <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is the palm of continency. To have resisted against <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, against injury, is the crown of patience. It is a triumph over <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> to despise money. It is the praise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by trust in the future, to suffer the adversity of the world. And he who is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> in prosperity, obtains <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for his humility; and he who is disposed to the mercifulness of cherishing the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, obtains the retribution of a heavenly treasure; and he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not to be jealous, and who with one heart and in meekness loves his brethren, is honoured with the recompense of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace. In this course of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> we daily run; to these palms and crowns of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> we attain without intermission of time.</p>

<p>17. To these rewards that you also may come who had been possessed with jealousy and rancour, cast away all that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> wherewith you were before held fast, and be reformed to the way of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Tear out from your breast thorns and thistles, that the Lord's seed may enrich you with a fertile produce, that the divine and spiritual cornfield may abound to the plentifulness of a fruitful harvest. Cast out the poison of gall, cast out the virus of discords. Let the mind which the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>  of the serpent had infected be purged; let all bitterness which had settled within be softened by the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If you take both meat and drink from the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, let the wood which at Mara  availed in a figure for sweetening the taste, avail to you in in reality for soothing your softened breast; and you shall not strive for a medicine for your increasing health. Be cured by that whereby you had been wounded.  Love those whom you previously had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>; favour those whom you envied with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> disparagements. Imitate good men, if you are able to follow them; but it you are not able to follow them, at least <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them, and congratulate those who are better than you. Make yourself a sharer  with them in united <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; make yourself their associate in the alliance of charity and the bond of brotherhood. Your debts shall be remitted to you when you yourself shall have forgiven. Your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> shall be received when you shall come in peace to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Your thoughts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> shall be directed from above, when you consider those things which are divine and righteous, as it is written: <q>Let the heart of a man consider righteous things, that his steps may be directed by the Lord.</q> </p>

<p>18. And you have many things to consider. Think of paradise, whither Cain does not enter,  who by jealousy slew his brother. Think of the heavenly kingdom, to which the Lord does not admit any but those who are of one heart and mind. Consider that those alone can be called sons of God who are peacemakers, who in heavenly  birth and by the divine law are made one, and respond to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consider that we are standing under the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we are pursuing the course of our conversation and our life, with God Himself looking on and judging, that we may then at length be able to attain to the result of beholding Him, if we now delight Him who sees us, by our actions, if we show ourselves worthy of His favour and indulgence; if we, who are always to please Him in His kingdom, previously please Him in the world.</p>
