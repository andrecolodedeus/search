<h1>Treatise 11</h1>

 <p><strong>Exhortation to Martyrdom, Addressed to Fortunatus.</strong></p>

<p>Preface. </p>

<p>1. You have desired, beloved Fortunatus  that, l since the burden of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and afflictions is lying heavy upon us, and in the ending and completion of the world the hateful time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is already beginning to draw near,  I would collect from the sacred Scriptures some exhortations for preparing and strengthening the minds of the brethren, whereby I might animate the soldiers of Christ for the heavenly and spiritual contest. I have been constrained to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your so needful wish, so that as much as my limited powers, instructed by the aid of divine inspiration, are sufficient, some arms, as it were, and defences might be brought forth from the Lord's precepts for the brethren who are about to fight. For it is little to arouse God's people by the trumpet call of our voice, unless we confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and their valour dedicated and devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the divine readings. </p>

<p>2. But what more fitly or more fully agrees with my own care and solicitude, than to prepare the people divinely entrusted to me, and an army established in the heavenly camp, by assiduous exhortations against the darts and weapons of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? For he cannot be a soldier fitted for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> who has not first been exercised in the field; nor will he who seeks to gain the crown of contest be rewarded on the racecourse, unless he first considers the use and skilfulness of his powers. It is an ancient adversary and an old enemy with whom we wage our battle: six thousand years are now nearly completed since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> first attacked man.  All kinds of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and arts, and snares for his overthrow, he has learned by the very practice of long years. If he finds Christ's soldier unprepared, if unskilled, if not careful and watching with his whole heart; he circumvents him if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, he deceives him incautious, he cheats him inexperienced. But if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, keeping the Lord's precepts, and bravely adhering to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  stands against him, he must needs be conquered, because Christ, whom that man confesses, is un-conquered.</p>

<p>3. And that I might not extend my discourse, beloved brother, to too great a length, and fatigue my hearer or reader by the abundance of a too diffuse style, I have made a compendium; so that the titles being placed first, which every one ought both to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to have in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I might subjoin sections of the Lord's word, and establish what I had proposed by the authority of the divine teaching, in such wise as that I might not appear to have sent you my own treatise so much, as to have suggested material for others to discourse on; a proceeding which will be of advantage to individuals with increased benefit. For if I were to give a man a garment finished and ready, it would be my garment that another was making use of, and probably the thing made for another would be found little fitting for his figure of stature and body. But now I have sent you the very wool and the purple  from the Lamb, by whom we were redeemed and quickened; which, when you have received, you will make into a coat for yourself according to your own will, and the rather that you will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it as your own private and special garment. And you will exhibit to others also what we have sent, that they themselves may be able to finish it according to their will; so that that old nakedness being covered, they may all bear the garments of Christ robed in the sanctification of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>4. Moreover also, beloved brethren, I have considered it a useful and wholesome plan in an exhortation so needful as that which may make <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, to cut off all delays and tardiness in our words, and to put away the windings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> discourse, and set down only those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaks, wherewith Christ exhorts His servants to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Those divine precepts themselves must be supplied, as it were, for arms for the combatants. Let them be the incitements of the warlike trumpet; let them he the clarion-blast for the warriors. Let the ears be roused by them; let the minds be prepared by them; let the powers both of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body be strengthened to all endurance of suffering. Let us only who, by the Lord's permission, have given the first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, also prepare each one for the second; urging and teaching that this is a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> greater in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, more lofty in power, more precious in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Christ exult&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> after which no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> any more  &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which completes the increase of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which, as we withdraw from the world, immediately associates us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water is received the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of blood the crown of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. This thing is to be embraced and desired, and to be asked for in all the entreaties of our petitions, that we who are God's servants should be also His friends.</p>

<h2>1. That idols are not gods, and that the elements are not to be worshipped in the place of gods.</h2> 

<p>In the cxiiith Psalm it is shown that <q>the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have a mouth, and speak not; eyes have they, and see not. They have ears, and hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouth. Let those that make them be made like them.</q>  Also in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>They counted all the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the nations to be gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers on their hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go. For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them; but no man can make a god like himself. For, since he is mortal, he works a dead thing with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands; for he himself is better than the things which he worships, since he indeed lived once, but they never.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053649"><a href="../bible/wis015.htm#verse15">Wisdom 15:15-17</a></span> In Exodus also: <q>You shall not make to you an idol, nor the likeness of anything.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053650"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse4">Exodus 20:4</a></span> Moreover, in Solomon, concerning the elements: <q>Neither by considering the works did they acknowledge who was the workmaster; but deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the sun, or the moon, to be gods.  On account of whose beauty, if they thought this, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much more beautiful is the Lord than they. Or if they admired their powers and operations, let them understand by them, that He that made these mighty things is mightier than they.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053652"><a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse1">Wisdom 13:1-4</a></span></p>

<h2>2. That God alone must be worshipped</h2>

<p><q>As it is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q>  Also in Exodus: <q>You shall have none other gods beside me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053654"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse3">Exodus 20:3</a></span> Also in Deuteronomy: <q>See, see that I am He, and that there is no God beside me. I will kill, and will make alive; I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who can deliver out of mine hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053655"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy 32:39</a></span> In the Apocalypse, moreover: <q>And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to preach over the earth, and over all nations, and tribes, and tongues, and peoples, saying with a loud voice, Fear God rather, and give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Him: for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that therein is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053656"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse6">Revelation 14:6-7</a></span> So also the Lord, in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, makes mention of the first and second commandment, saying, <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, The Lord your God is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053657"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse29">Mark 12:29-31</a></span> and, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your Lord with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength. This is the first; and the second is like it, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053658"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37-40</a></span> And once more: <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053659"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a></span></p>

<h2>3. What is God's threatening against those who sacrifice to idols?</h2>

<p>In Exodus: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any gods but the Lord only, shall be rooted out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053660"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a></span> Also in Deuteronomy: <q>They <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> unto <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053661"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 32:17</a></span> In Isaiah also: <q>They worshipped those which their fingers have made; and the mean man was bowed down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not forgive them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053662"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse8">Isaiah 2:8-9</a></span> And again: <q>To them have you poured out drink-offerings, and to them you have offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For these, therefore, shall I not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, says the Lord? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053663"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse6">Isaiah 57:6</a></span> In Jeremiah also: <q>Walk not after other gods, to serve them; and worship them not, and provoke me not in the works of your hands, to destroy you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053664"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 7:6</a></span> In the Apocalypse too: <q>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, he shall also drink of the wine of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is mixed in the cup of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and shall be punished with fire and brimstone before the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and before the eyes of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torments shall ascend for ever and ever: and they shall have no rest day or night, whosoever worship the beast and his image.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053665"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse9">Revelation 14:9-11</a></span></p>

<h2>4. That God does not easily pardon idolaters</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in Exodus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for the people, and does not obtain his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, saying: <q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, O Lord, this people has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They have made them gods of gold. And now, if You forgive them their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of the book which You have written. And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, If any one has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against me, him will I blot out of my book.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053666"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse31">Exodus 32:31-33</a></span> Moreover, when Jeremiah besought for the people, the Lord speaks to him, saying: <q>And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for this people, and entreat not for them in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication; because I will not hear in the time wherein they shall call upon me in the time of their affliction.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053667"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 7:16</a></span> Ezekiel also denounces this same <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God upon those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and says: <q>And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, whatsoever land <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against me, by committing an offense, I will stretch forth mine hand upon it, and will crush the support of the bread thereof; and I wills send into it famine, and I will take away from it man and beast. And though these three men were in the midst of it, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel, and Job, they shall not deliver sons nor daughters; they themselves only shall be delivered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053668"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 14:12-14</a></span> Likewise in the first book of Kings: <q>If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by offending against another, they shall beseech the Lord for him; but if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall entreat for him? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053669"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse25">1 Samuel 2:25</a></span></p>

<h2>5. That God is so angry against idolatry, that He has even enjoined those to be slain who persuade others to sacrifice and serve idols</h2>

<p>In Deuteronomy: <q>But if your brother, or your son, or your daughter, or your wife which is in your bosom, or your friend which is the fellow of your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, should ask you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, you shall not consent unto him, and you shall not hearken unto him, neither shall your eye spare him, neither shall you conceal him, declaring you shall declare concerning him. Your hand shall be upon him first of all to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people; and they shall stone him, and he shall die, because he has sought to turn you away from the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053670"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 13:6-10</a></span> And again the Lord speaks, and says, that neither must a city be spared, even though the whole city should consent to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: <q>Or if you shall hear in one of the cities which the Lord your God shall give you, to dwell there, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,  slaying you shall kill all who are in the city with the slaughter of the sword, and bum the city with fire, and it shall be without habitation for ever. Moreover, it shall no more be rebuilt, that the Lord may be turned from the indignation of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And He will show you mercy, and He will pity you, and will multiply you, if you will hear the voice of the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will observe His precepts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053672"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a></span> Remembering which precept and its force, Mattathias slew him who had approached the altar to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. But if before the coming of Christ these precepts concerning the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the despising of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were observed, how much more should they be regarded since Christ's advent; since He, when He came, not only exhorted us with words, but with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also, but after all wrongs and contumelies, suffered also, and was crucified, that He might teach us to suffer and to die by His example, that there might be no excuse for a man not to suffer for Him,  since He suffered for us; and that since He suffered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, much rather ought each to suffer for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

Wherefore in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> let no one think what danger the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is bringing in, but let him indeed consider what help God affords; nor let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mischief overpower the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but let divine protection strengthen the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; since every one, according to the Lord's promises and the deservings of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, receives so much from God's help as he thinks that he receives.

If, therefore, they shall say to you, Lo, he is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; go not forth: lo, he is in the sleeping chambers; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not. For as the flashing of lightning goes forth from the east, and appears even to the west, so also shall the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be. Wheresoever the carcass shall be, there shall the eagles be gathered together. But immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved: and then shall appear the sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in heaven: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament, and shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And He shall send His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the heights of heaven, even into the farthest bounds thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053724"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse4">Matthew 24:4-31</a></span> And these are not new or sudden things which are now happening to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; since the good and righteous, and those who are devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the law of innocence and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, advance always through afflictions, and wrongs, and the severe and manifold penalties of troubles, in the hardship of a narrow path. Thus, at the very beginning of the world, the righteous Abel was the first to be shin by his brother; and Jacob was driven into exile, and Joseph was sold, and king Saul <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the merciful David; and king Ahab endeavoured to oppress Elias, who firmly and bravely asserted the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Zacharias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was slain between the temple and the altar, that himself might there become a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> where he was accustomed to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of the righteous have, in fact, often been celebrated; so many examples of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> have been set forth to future generations. The three youths, Ananias, Azarias, and Mis&auml;el, equal in age, agreeing in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, steadfast in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, constant in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, stronger than the flames and penalties that urged them, proclaim that they only <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him alone, that they worship Him alone, saying: <q>O king Nebuchodonosor, there is no need for us to answer you in this matter. For the God whom we serve is able to deliver us out of the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from your hands, O king.

Seven brethren were thus associating in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. As the first seven days in the divine arrangement containing seven thousand of years,  as the seven spirits and seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which stand and go in and out before the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the seven-branched lamp in the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and the seven golden candlesticks in the Apocalypse, and the seven columns in Solomon upon which Wisdom built her house l so here also the number seven of the brethren, embracing, in the quantity of their number, the seven churches, as likewise in the first book of Kings we read that the barren has borne seven. And in Isaiah seven <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> lay hold on one man, whose name they ask to be called upon them. And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who refers to this lawful and certain number, writes to the seven churches. And in the Apocalypse the Lord directs His divine and heavenly precepts to the seven churches and their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which number is now found in this case, in the seven brethren, that a lawful consummation may be completed. With the seven children is manifestly associated also the mother, their origin and root, who subsequently begot seven churches, she herself having been first, and alone founded upon a rock  by the voice of the Lord.  Nor is it of no account that in their sufferings the mother alone is with her children.

<p>But what utterances of confessions did they herald forth! How illustrious, how great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did they afford! The king Antiochus, their enemy&mdash; yea, in Antiochus <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> was set forth&mdash; sought to pollute the mouths of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and unconquered in the spirit of confession, with the contagion of swine's flesh; and when he had severely beaten them with whips, and could prevail nothing, commanded iron plates to be heated, which being heated and made to glow, he commanded him who had first spoken, and had more provoked the king with the constancy of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be brought up and roasted, his tongue having first been pulled out and cut off, which had confessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this happened the more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. For the tongue which had confessed the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought itself first to go to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then in the second, sharper pains having been devised, before he tortured the other limbs, he tore off the skin of his head with the hair, doubtless with a purpose in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For since Christ is the head of the man, and God is the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he who tore the head in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> God and Christ in that head. But he, trusting in his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and promising to himself from the retribution of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the reward of resurrection, exclaimed and said, <q>You indeed impotently destroy us out of this present life; but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, unto the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> resurrection of life.</q>  The third being challenged, quickly put forth his tongue; for he had learned from his brother to despise the punishment of cutting off the tongue. Moreover, he firmly held forth his hands to be cut off, greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in such a mode of punishment, since it was his lot to imitate, by stretching forth his hands, the form of his Lord's passion. And also the fourth, with like <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, despising the tortures, and answering, to restrain the king, with a heavenly voice exclaimed, and said, <q>It is better that those who are given to death by men should wait for hope from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be raised up by Him again to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.

But think not that our race is forsaken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Abide, and see His great power, how He will torment you and your seed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053735"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse16">2 Maccabbees 7:16</a></span> What alleviation was that to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>!  how substantial a comfort in his sufferings, not to consider his own torments, but to predict the penalties of his tormentor! But in the sixth, not his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> only, but also his humility, is to be set forth; that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> claimed nothing to himself, nor even made an account of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his own confession with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> words, but rather ascribed it to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that he was suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the king, while he attributed to God that afterwards he should be avenged. He taught that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are modest, that they were confident of vengeance, and boasted nothing in their suffering. <q>Do not,</q> said he, <q>needlessly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>; for we on our own account suffer these things, as sinning against our God. But think not that you shall be unpunished, who darest to fight against God.</q>  Also the admirable mother, who, neither broken down by the weakness of her sex, nor moved by her manifold bereavement, looked upon her dying children with cheerfulness, and did not reckon those things punishments of her darlings, but glories, giving as great a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to God by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of her eyes, as her children had given by the tortures and suffering of their limbs; when, after the punishment and slaying of six, there remained one of the brethren, to whom the king promised riches, and power, and many things, that his cruelty and ferocity might be soothed by the satisfaction of even one being subdued, and asked that the mother would entreat that her son might be cast down with herself; she entreated, but it was as became a mother of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>&mdash; as became one who was mindful of the law and of God&mdash; as became one who loved her sons not delicately, but bravely. For she entreated, but it was that he would confess God. She entreated that the brother would not be separated from his brothers in the alliance of praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; then only considering herself the mother of seven sons, if it should happen to her to have brought forth seven sons, not to the world, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore arming him, and strengthening him, and so bearing her son by a more blessed birth, she said, <q>O son, pity me that bare you ten  months in the womb, and gave you milk for three years, and nourished you and brought you up to this age; I pray you, O son, look upon the heaven and the earth; and having considered all the things which are in them, understand that out of nothing God made these things and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Therefore, O son,  do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that executioner; but being made worthy of your brethren, receive death, that in the same mercy I may receive you with your brethren.</q>  The mother's praise was great in her exhortation to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but greater in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that she promised nothing to herself or her son from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the six <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the brothers would avail  for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of one who should deny, but rather persuaded him to become a sharer in their suffering, that in the day of judgment he might be found with his brethren. After this the another also dies with her children; for neither was anything else becoming, than that she who had borne and made <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, should be joined in the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with them, and that she herself should follow those whom she had sent before to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And lest any, when the opportunity either of a certificate or of any such matter is offered to him whereby he may deceive, should embrace the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> part of deceivers, let us not be silent, moreover, about Eleazar, who, when an opportunity was offered him by the ministers of the king, that having received the flesh which it was allowable for him to partake of, he might pretend, for the misguiding of the king, that he ate those things which were forced upon him from the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and unlawful meats, would not consent to this deception, saying that it was fitting neither for his age nor nobility to feign that, whereby others would be scandalized and led into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; if they should think that Eleazar, being ninety years old, had left and betrayed the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had gone over to the manner of aliens; and that it was not of so much consequence to gain the short moments of life, and so incur <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment from an offended God. And he having been long tortured, and now at length reduced to extremity, while he was dying in the midst of stripes and tortures, groaned and said, <q>O Lord, that hast the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is manifest that although I might be delivered from death, I suffer the severest pains of body, being beaten with scourges; but with my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, on account of Your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, I willingly suffer these things.</q>  Assuredly his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was sincere and his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> sound, and abundantly pure, not to have regarded king Antiochus, but God the Judge, and to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that it could not avail him for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if he should mock and deceive man, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the judge of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and who only is to be feared, cannot at all be mocked nor deceived. If, therefore, we also live as dedicated and devoted to God&mdash; if we make our way over the ancient and sacred footsteps of the righteous, let us go through the same <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of sufferings, the same testimonies of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, considering the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of our time the greater on this account, that while ancient examples may be numbered, yet that subsequently, when the abundance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was in excess, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> cannot be numbered, as the Apocalypse testifies and says: <q>After these things I beheld a great multitude, which no man could number, of every nation, and of every tribe, and people, and language, standing in the sight of the throne and of the Lamb; and they were clothed in white robes, and palms were in their hands; and they said with a loud voice, Salvation to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb! And one of the elders answered and said unto me, Who are those which are arrayed in white robes, and whence come they? And I said unto him, My lord, you know. And he said unto me, These are they who have come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve Him day and night in His temple.</q>  But if the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is shown and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so great, let no one think it a hard or a difficult thing to become a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, when he sees that the crowd of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> cannot be numbered.</p>

<h2>12. What hope and reward remains for the righteous and for martyrs after the conflicts and sufferings of this present time</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shows and predicts by Solomon, saying: <q>And although in the sight of men they suffered torments, yet their hope is full of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. And having been troubled in a few things, they shall be in many happily ordered, because God has tried them, and has found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace, He has tried them; and as whole burnt-offerings of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, He has received them, and in its season there will be respect of them. They will shine and run about as sparks in a place set with reeds.  They shall judge the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and have dominion over the peoples; and their Lord shall reign for ever.</q>  In the same also our vengeance is described, and the repentance of those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> and molest us is announced. <q>Then,</q> says he, shall the righteous stand in great constancy before such as have afflicted them, and who have taken away their labours; when they see it, they shall be troubled with a horrible <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: and they shall marvel at the suddenness of their unexpected <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, saying among themselves, repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit, These are they whom we had sometime in derision and as a proverb of reproach. We fools counted their life <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and their end to be without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. How are they numbered among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their lot is among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>! Therefore have we erred from the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the light of righteousness has not shined unto us, and the sun has not risen upon us. We have been wearied in the way of unrighteousness and perdition, and have walked through hard deserts, but have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of the Lord. What has <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us, or what has the boasting of riches brought to us? All these things have passed away like a shadow. Likewise in the cxvth Psalm is shown the price and the reward of suffering: <q>Precious,</q> it says, in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.  In the cxxvth Psalm also is expressed the sadness of the struggle, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the retribution: <q>They who sow,</q> it says. <q>in tears, shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. As they walked, they walked and wept, casting their seeds; but as they come again, they shall come in exultation, bearing their sheaves.</q>  And again, in the cxviiith Psalm: <q>Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they who search His testimonies, and seek Him out with their whole heart.</q>  Moreover, the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, Himself the avenger of our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and the rewarder of our suffering, says: <q>Blessed are they who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  And again: <q>Blessed shall you be when men shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and shall separate you, and shall expel you, and shall revile your name as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man's</a> sake. Rejoice on that day, and leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; for, behold, your reward is great in heaven.</q>  And once more: <q>Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</q>  Nor do the rewards of the divine promise attend those alone who are reproached and slain; but if the passion itself, be wanting to the faithful, while their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has remained sound and unconquered, and having forsaken and contemned all his possessions, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> has shown that he is following Christ, even be also is honoured by Christ among the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as He Himself promises and says: <q>There is no man that leaves house, or land, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, but shall receive seven times as much in this present time, and in the world to come <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q>  In the Apocalypse also He says the same thing: <q>And I saw,</q> says he, <q>the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And when he had placed those who were slain in the first place, he added, saying: <q>And whosoever had not worshipped the image of the beast, neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hand; </q>all these he joins together, as seen by him at one time in the same place, and says, <q>And they lived and reigned with Christ.</q>  He says that all live and reign with Christ, not only who have been slain; but even whosoever, standing in firmness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have not worshipped the image of the beast, and have not consented to his deadly and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> edicts.</p>

<h2>13. That we receive more as the reward of our suffering than what we endure here in the suffering itself</h2>

<p>The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> proves; who by the divine condescension, being caught up into the third heaven and into paradise, testifies that he heard unspeakable words, who boasts that he saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of sight, who professes that which he both learned and saw with the greater <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of consciousness, and says: <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q>  Who, then, does not with all his powers labour to attain to such a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that he may become the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may at once <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with Christ, that after earthly tortures and punishments he may receive divine rewards? If to soldiers of this world it is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to return in triumph to their country when the foe is vanquished, how much more excellent and greater is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is overcome, to return in triumph to paradise, and to bring back victorious trophies to that place whence <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was ejected as a sinner, after casting down him who formerly had cast him down; to offer to God the most acceptable gift&mdash; an uncorrupted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and an unyielding <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, an illustrious praise of devotion; to accompany Him when He shall come to receive vengeance from His enemies, to stand at His side when He shall sit to judge, to become co-heir of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to be made equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; with the patriarchs, with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the possession of the heavenly kingdom! Such thoughts as these, what <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> can conquer, what tortures can overcome? The brave and steadfast <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, founded in religious meditations, endures; and the spirit abides unmoved against all the terrors of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the threats of the world, when it is strengthened by the sure and solid <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of things to come. In <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, earth is shut up,  but heaven is opened; <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is threatening, but Christ is protecting; death is brought in, but <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> follows; the world is taken away from him that is slain, but paradise is set forth to him restored; the life of time is extinguished, but the life of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is realized. What a dignity it is, and what a security, to go gladly from hence, to depart <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> in the midst of afflictions and tribulations; in a moment to close the eyes with which men and the world are looked upon, and at once to open them to look upon God and Christ! Of such a blessed departure how great is the swiftness! You shall be suddenly taken away from earth, to be placed in the heavenly kingdoms. It behooves us to embrace these things in our mind and consideration, to meditate on these things day and night. If <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> should fall upon such a soldier of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, prompt for battle, will not be able tO be overcome. Or if his call should come to him before, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall not be without reward, seeing it was prepared for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; without loss of time, the reward is rendered by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the warfare&mdash;in peace, the purity of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, is crowned. </p>
