<h1>Treatise 12, First Book</h1>

 <p><strong>Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews.</strong></p>

<p>Cyprian to his son Quirinus, greeting. It was necessary, my beloved son, that I should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your spiritual desire, which asked with most urgent petition for those divine teachings wherewith the Lord has condescended to teach and instruct us by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, that, being led away from the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and enlightened by His pure and shining light, we may keep the way of life through the saving <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And indeed, as you have asked, so has this discourse been arranged by me; and this treatise has been ordered in an abridged compendium, so that I should not scatter what was written in too diffuse an abundance, but, as far as my poor memory suggested, might collect all that was necessary in selected and connected heads, under which I may seem, not so much to have treated the subject, as to have afforded material for others to treat it. Moreover, to readers also, brevity of the same kind is of very great advantage, in that a treatise of too great length dissipates the understanding and perception of the reader, while a tenacious memory keeps that which is read in a more exact compendium. But I have comprised in my undertaking two books of equally moderate length: one wherein I have endeavoured to show that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, according to what had before been foretold, had departed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had lost God's favour, which had been given them in past time, and had been promised them for the future; while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had succeeded to their place, deserving well of the Lord by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and coming out of all nations and from the whole world. The second book likewise contains the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He has come who was announced according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and has done and perfected all those things whereby He was foretold as being able to be perceived and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.  And these things may be of advantage to you meanwhile, as you read, for forming the first lineaments of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. More strength will be given you, and the intelligence of the heart will be effected more and more, as you examine more fully the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, old and new, and read through the complete volumes of the spiritual books.  For now we have filled a small measure from the divine fountains, which in the meantime we would send to you. You will be able to drink more plentifully, and to be more abundantly satisfied, if you also will approach to drink together with us at the same springs of the divine fullness.  I bid you, beloved son, always heartily farewell.</p>

<h2>1. That the Jews have fallen under the heavy wrath of God because they have forsaken the Lord, and have followed idols</h2>

<p>In Exodus the people said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: <q>Arise and make us gods which shall go before us: because as for this man <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who brought us out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what has become of him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053762"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> In the same place also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says to the Lord: <q>O Lord, I pray you, this people have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>! A great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They have made to themselves gods of gold and silver. And now, if you will forgive them their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forgive; but if not, blot me out of the book which You have written. And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, If any one has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against me, him will I blot out of my book.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053763"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse31">Exodus&nbsp;32:31-33</a></span> Likewise in Deuteronomy: They <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> unto <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note053764"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:17</a></span> In the book of Judges too: <q>And the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and followed the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and offended the Lord, and forsook <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> added again to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  in the sight of the Lord, and served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> and the gods of the strangers, and forsook the Lord, and served Him not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053767"><a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#verse1">Judges 4:1</a></span> In Malachi: <q>Judah is forsaken, and has become an abomination in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and in Jerusalem, because Judah has profaned the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Lord in those things wherein He has loved, and courted strange gods. The Lord will cut off the man who does this, and he shall be made base in the tabernacles of Jacob.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053768"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse11">Malachi 2:11</a></span></p>

<h2>2. Also because they did not believe the prophets, and put them to death</h2>

<p>In Jeremiah the Lord says: <q>I have sent unto I you my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Before the daylight I sent them (and you heard me not, and did not listen with your ears), saying, Let every one of you be converted from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and from your most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires; and you shall dwell in that land which I have given you and your fathers for ever and ever.</q>  And again:  <q>Go not after other gods, to serve them, and do not worship them; and provoke me not to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the works of your hands to scatter you abroad; and you have not hearkened unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053771"><a href="../bible/jer025.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 25:6-7</a></span> Also in the third book of the Kings, Elias says unto the Lord: <q>In being jealous I have been jealous for the Lord God Almighty; because the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have forsaken You, have demolished Your altars, and have slain Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the sword; and I have remained solitary, and they seek my life, to take it away from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053772"><a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse10">1 Kings 19:10</a></span> In Ezra also: <q>They have fallen away from You, and have cast Your law behind their backs, and have killed Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which testified against them that they should return to You.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053773"><a href="../bible/neh009.htm#verse26">Nehemiah 9:26</a></span></p>

<h2>3. That it was previously foretold that they would neither know the Lord, nor understand, nor receive Him</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord has spoken; I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rejected me. The ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, and my people has not perceived me. Ah sinful nation, a people filled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> seed, corrupting children: you have forsaken the Lord, and have sent that Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053774"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah 1:2-4</a></span> In the same also the Lord says: <q>Go and tell this people, You shall hear with the ear, and shall not understand; and seeing, you shall see, and shall not perceive. For the heart of this people has grown gross, and they hardly hear with their ears, and they have shut up their eyes, lest haply they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should return, and I should heal them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053775"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse9">Isaiah 6:9-10</a></span> Also in Jeremiah the Lord says: <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves worn-out cisterns, which could not hold water.</q>  Moreover, in the same: <q>Behold, the word of the Lord has become unto them a reproach, and they do not wish for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053777"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse10">Jeremiah 6:10</a></span> Again in the same the Lord says: <q>The kite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his time, the turtle, and the swallow;  the sparrows of the field keep the time of their coining in; but my people does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the judgment of the Lord. How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? The false measurement  has been made vain; the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> are confounded the wise men have trembled, and been taken, because they have rejected the word of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053780"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 8:7-9</a></span> In Solomon also: <q>Evil men seek me, and shall not find me; for they held wisdom in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and did not receive the word of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053781"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse28">Proverbs 1:28-29</a></span> Also in the twenty-seventh Psalm: <q>Render to them their deserving, because they have not perceived in the works of the Lord.</q>  Also in the eighty-first Psalm: <q>They have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, neither have they understood; they shall walk on in darkness.</q>  In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, too, according to John: <q>He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053784"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse11">John 1:11-12</a></span></p>

<h2>4. That the Jews would not understand the Holy Scriptures, but that they would be intelligible in the last times, after that Christ had come</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>And all these words shall be unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which, if you shall give to a man that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> letters to read, he shall say, I cannot read, for it is sealed. But in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they who are in darkness and in a cloud; the eyes of the blind shall see.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053785"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse11">Isaiah 29:11-18</a></span> Also in Jeremiah: <q>In the last of the days you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053786"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse20">Jeremiah 23:20</a></span> In Daniel, moreover: <q>Secure the words, and seal the book until the time of consummation, until many learn, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is fulfilled, because when there shall be a dispersion they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053787"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse4">Daniel 12:4-7</a></span> Likewise in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Brethren, I would not that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that all our fathers were under the cloud.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053788"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 10:1</a></span> Also in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>Their minds are blinded even unto this day, by this same veil which is taken away in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while this same veil remains in the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which is not unveiled, because it is made void in Christ; and even to this day, if at any time <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is read, the veil is upon their heart. But by and by, when they shall be turned unto the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</q>  In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> says: <q>These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, concerning me. Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and said unto them, That thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name even among all nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053790"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke 24:44-47</a></span></p>

<h2>5. That the Jews could understand nothing of the Scriptures unless they first believed in Christ</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>And if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, neither will you understand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053791"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah 7:9</a></span> Also the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>For if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that I am He, you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053792"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse24">John 8:24</a></span> Moreover, that righteousness should subsist by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that in it was life, was predicted in Habakkuk: <q>Now the just shall live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053793"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk 2:4</a></span> Hence <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the father of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; in Genesis: <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053794"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse6">Genesis 15:6</a></span> In like manner, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Galatians: <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, therefore, that they which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the same are children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, foreseeing that God justifies the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, foretold to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that all nations should be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in him. Therefore they who are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are blessed  with faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053796"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse6">Galatians 3:6-9</a></span></p>

<h2>6. That the Jews should lose Jerusalem, and should leave the land which they had received</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers shall devour it in your sight; and the daughter of Zion shall be left deserted, and overthrown by foreign peoples, as a cottage in a vineyard, and as a keeper's lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a city which is besieged. And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should have been as Sodoma, and we should have been like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053797"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse7">Isaiah 1:7-9</a></span> Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says: <q>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> them that are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053798"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew 23:37-38</a></span></p>

<h2>7. Also that they should lose the Light of the Lord</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Come, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. For He has sent away His people, the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053799"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse5">Isaiah 2:5-6</a></span> In His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also, according to John: <q>That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which lights every man that comes into this world. He was in this world, and the world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053800"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John 3:18-19</a></span> Moreover, in the same place: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not is judged already, because he has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<h2>8. That the first circumcision of the flesh is made void, and the second circumcision of the spirit is promised instead</h2>

<h2>13. That the old yoke should be made void, and a new yoke should be given</h2>

<p>In the second Psalm: <q>For what purpose have the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> raged, and the people imagined vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers have gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ.

<h2>14. That the old pastors should cease and new ones begin</h2>

<p>In Ezekiel: <q>Wherefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I am above the shepherds; and I will require my sheep from their hands, and I will turn them away from feeding my sheep; and they shall feed them no more, and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, and I will feed them with judgment.</q>  In Jeremiah the Lord says: <q>And I will give you shepherds according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with the food of discipline.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053821"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse15">Jeremiah 3:15</a></span> In Jeremiah, moreover: <q>Hear the word of the Lord, you nations, and tell it to the islands which are afar off. Say, He that scatters <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd his flock: for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and taken him out from the hand of him that was stronger than he.</q> </p>

<h2>15. That Christ should be the house and temple of God, and that the old temple should cease, and the new one should begin</h2>

<p>In the second book of Kings: <q>And the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord, You shall not build me an house to dwell in; but it shall be, when your days shall be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which shall come from your bowels, and I will make ready his kingdom. He shall build me an house in my name, and I will raise up his throne for ever; and I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to me for a son: and his house shall obtain confidence, and his kingdom for evermore in my sight.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says: <q>There shall not be left in the temple one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053824"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse2">Matthew 24:2</a></span> And <q>After three days another shall be raised up without hands.</q> </p>

<h2>16. That the ancient sacrifice should be made void, and a new one should be celebrated</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>For what purpose to me is the multitude of your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>? Says the Lord: I am full; I will not have the burnt <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of rams, and fat of lambs, and blood of bulls and goats. For who has required these things from your hands? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053826"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse11">Isaiah 1:11-12</a></span> Also in the forty-ninth Psalm: <q>I will not eat the flesh of bulls, nor drink the blood of goats. Offer to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you: and you shall glorify me.</q>  In the same Psalm, moreover: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise shall glorify me: therein is the way in which I will show him the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  In the fourth Psalm too: <q>Sacrifice the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, and hope in the Lord.</q>  Likewise in Malachi: <q>I have no pleasure concerning you, says the Lord, and I will not have an accepted offering from your hands. Because from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and in every place odours of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> are offered to my name, and a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, because great is my name among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, says the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>17. That the old priesthood should cease, and a new priest should come, who should be for ever</h2>

<p>In the cixth Psalm: <q>Before the morning star I begot you. The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and He will not repent, You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>.</q>  Also in the first book of Kings, God says to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Eli: <q>And I will raise up to me a faithful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who shall do all things which are in my heart: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall pass in the presence of my anointed ones for all days. And it shall be, whosoever shall remain in your house, shall come to worship for an obolus of money, and for one loaf of bread.</q> </p>

<h2>18. That another Prophet such as Moses was promised, to wit, one who should give a new testament, and who rather ought to be heard</h2>

<p>In Deuteronomy God said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>And the Lord said to me, A Prophet will I raise up to them from among their brethren, such as you, and I will give my word in His mouth; and He shall speak unto them that which I shall command Him. And whosoever shall not hear whatsoever things that Prophet shall speak in my name, I will avenge it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053833"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a></span> Concerning whom also Christ says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in which you think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. These are they which set forth testimony concerning me; and you will not come to me, that you might have life. Do not think that I accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, on whom you hope. For if you had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me: for he wrote of me. But if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not his writings, how shall you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> my words? </q> </p>

<h2>19. That two peoples were foretold, the eider and the younger; that is, the old people of the Jews, and the new one which should consist of us</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>And the Lord said unto Rebekah, Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your belly; and the one people shall overcome the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053835"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis 25:23</a></span> Also in Hosea: <q>I will call them my people that are not my people, and her beloved that was not beloved. For it shall be, in that place in which it shall be called not my people, they shall be called the sons of the living God.</q> </p>

<h2>20. That the Church which before had been barren should have more children from among the Gentiles than what the synagogue had had before</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Rejoice, you barren, that bar-est not; and break forth and cry, you that travailest not: because many more are the children of the desolate one than of her who has an husband. For the Lord has said, Enlarge the place of your tabernacle, and of your curtains, and fasten them: spare not, make long your measures, and strengthen your stakes: stretch forth yet to your right hand and to your left hand; and your seed shall possess the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and shall inhabit the deserted cities. Fear not; because you shall overcome: nor be afraid because you are cursed; for you shall forget your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> confusion.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053837"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse1">Isaiah 54:1-4</a></span> Thus also to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when his former son was born of a bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Sarah remained long barren; and late in old age bare her son Isaac, of promise, who was the type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Thus also Jacob received two wives: the eider Leah, with weak eyes, a type of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; the younger the beautiful Rachel, a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who also remained long barren, and afterwards brought forth Joseph, who also was himself a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And in the first of Kings it is said that Elkanah had two wives: Peninnah, with her sons; and Hannah, barren, from whom is born Samuel, not according to the order of generation, but according to the mercy and promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when she had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the temple; and Samuel being born, was a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Also in the first book of Kings: <q>The barren has borne seven and she that had many children has grown weak.</q>  But the seven children are the seven churches. Whence also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote to seven churches; and the Apocalypse sets forth seven churches, that the number seven may be preserved; as the seven days in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the world; as the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who stand and go in and out before the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Raphael the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> says in Tobit; and the sevenfold lamp in the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; and the seven eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which keep watch over the world; and the stone with seven eyes, as Zechariah says; and the seven spirits; and the seven candlesticks in the Apocalypse; and the seven pillars upon which Wisdom has built her house in Solomon.</p>

<h2>21. That the Gentiles should rather believe in Christ</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>And the Lord God said unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Go out from your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, and go into that land which I shall show you: and I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will magnify your name; and you shall be blessed: and I will bless him that blesses you, and I will curse him that curses you. and in you shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053839"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse1">Genesis 11:1-3</a></span> On this same point in Genesis: <q>And Isaac blessed Jacob.

Moreover, Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: this is my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>; place your right hand upon his head. But he would not, and said, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, my son, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it: and he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</q>  Moreover in Genesis: <q>Judah, your brethren shall praise you: your hand shall be upon the back of your enemies; the sons of your father shall worship you. Judah is a lion's cub: from the slender twig,  my son, you have ascended: you lied down and slept as a lion, and as a lion's cub. Who shall stir him up? There shall not fail a prince from Judah, and a leader from his loins, until those things entrusted to him shall come; and he is the hope of the nations: binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the branch of the vine;  he shall wash his garments in wine, and his clothing in the blood of the grape: terrible are his eyes with wine, and his teeth are whiter than milky,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053845"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse8">Genesis 49:8-12</a></span> Hence in Numbers it is written concerning our people: <q>Behold, the people shall rise up as a lion-like people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053846"><a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse14">Numbers 23:14</a></span> In Deuteronomy: <q>You <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall be for the head; but this unbelieving people shall be for the tail.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053847"><a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse44">Deuteronomy 28:44</a></span> Also in Jeremiah: <q>Hear the sound of the trumpet.

I said, Lo, here am I, to a nation that has not called upon my! name.</q>  Of this same thing, in the Acts of the Apostles, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>It was necessary that the word of God should first be shown to you; but since you put it from you, and judged yourselves unworthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, lo, we turn to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: for thus said the Lord by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, Behold, I have set You a light among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that You should be for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> even to the ends of the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>22. That the Jews would lose while we should receive the bread and the cup of Christ and all His grace, and that the new name of Christians should be blessed in the earth</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Thus says the Lord, Behold, they who serve me shall eat, but you shall be hungry: behold, they who serve me shall drink, but you shall be thirsty:  behold, they who serve me shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but you shall be confounded; the Lord shall slay you. But to those who serve me a new name shall be named, which shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the earth.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Therefore shall He lift up an ensign to the nations which are afar off, and He will draw them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come swiftly with lightness; they shall not hunger nor thirst.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Behold, therefore, the Ruler, the Lord of Sabaoth, shall take away from Judah and from Jerusalem the healthy man and the strong man, the strength of bread and the strength of water.</q>  Likewise in the thirty-third Psalm: <q>O taste and see how sweet is the Lord. Blessed is the man that hopes in Him. Fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, all you His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: for there is no want to them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him. Rich men have wanted and have hungered; but they who seek the Lord shall never want any good thing.</q>  Moreover, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, the Lord says: <q>I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall not hunger, and he that trusts in me shall never thirst.</q>  Likewise He says in that place: <q>If any one thirst, let him come and drink. He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q>  Moreover, He says in the same place: <q>Unless you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall have no life in you.</q> </p>

<h2>23. That the Gentiles rather than the Jews attain to the kingdom of heaven</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says: <q>Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall lie down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but the children of the kingdom shall go out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> </p>

<h2>24. That by this alone the Jews can receive pardon of their sins, if they wash away the blood of Christ slain, in His baptism, and, passing over into His Church, obey His precepts</h2>

<p>In Isaiah the Lord says: <q>Now I will not release your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. When you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my face from you; and if you multiply <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; take away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from the sight of my eyes; cease from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; learn to do good; seek judgment; keep him who suffers wrong; judge for the orphan, and justify the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. And come, let us reason together, says the Lord: and although your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will whiten  them as snow; and although they were as crimson, I will whiten  them as wool. And if you be willing and listen to me, you shall eat of the good of the land; but if you be unwilling, and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.</q> </p>
