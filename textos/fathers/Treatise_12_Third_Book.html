<h1>Treatise 12, Third Book</h1>

<p>Cyprian to his son Quirinus,  greeting. Of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion which you manifest to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, beloved son, you asked me to gather out for your instruction from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> some heads bearing upon the religious teaching of our school;  seeking for a succinct course of sacred reading, so that your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, surrendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might not be wearied with long or numerous volumes of books, but, instructed with a summary of heavenly precepts, might have a wholesome and large compendium for nourishing its memory. And because I owe you a plentiful and loving <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, I have done what you wished. I have laboured for once, that you might not always labour.  Therefore, as much as my small ability could embrace, I have collected certain precepts of the Lord, and divine teachings, which may be easy and useful to the readers, in that a few things digested into a short space are both quickly read through, and are frequently repeated. I bid you, beloved son, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<h2>1. Of the benefit of good works and mercy</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Cry aloud,</q> says He, <q>and spare not; lift up your voice like a trumpet; tell my people their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the house of Jacob their wickednesses. They seek me from day to day, and desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my ways, as a people which did righteousness, and did not forsake the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They ask of me now a righteous judgment, and desire to approach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, What! Because we have fasted, and You have not seen: we have humiliated our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and You have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For in the days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> are found your own wills; for either you torment those who are subjected to you, or you fast for strifes and judgments, or you strike your neighbours with fists. For what do you fast unto me, that today your voice should be heard in clamour? This fast I have not chosen, save that a man should <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And if you shall bend your neck like a ring, and spread under you sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall it be called an acceptable fast. Not such a fast have I chosen, says the Lord; but loose every knot of unrighteousness, let go the chokings of impotent engagements.  Send away the harassed into rest, and scatter every unrighteous contract. Break your bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into your dwelling. If you see the naked, clothe him; and despise not them of your own seed in your house. Then shall your seasonable light break forth, and your garments shall quickly arise; and righteousness shall go before you: and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God shall surround you. Then you shall cry out, and God shall hear you; while you are yet speaking, He shall say, Here I am.</q>  Concerning this same thing in Job: <q>I have preserved the needy from the hand of the mighty; and I have helped the orphan, to whom there was no helper. The mouth of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> blessed me, since I was the eye of the blind; I was also the foot of the lame, and the father of the weak.</q>  Of this same matter in Tobit: <q>And I said to Tobias, My son, go and bring whatever poor man you shall find out of our brethren, who still has God in mind with his whole heart. Bring him hither, and he shall eat my dinner together with me. Behold, I attend you, my son, until you come.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>All the days of your life, my son, keep God in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and transgress not His precepts. Do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> all the days of your life, and do not walk in the way of unrighteousness; because if you act <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, there will be respect of your works. Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of your substance, and turn not your face from any poor man. So shall it come to pass that the face of God shall not be turned away from you. Even as you have, my son, so do: if you have abundant substance, give the more <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> therefrom; if you have little, communicate even of that little. And do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> when you give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: you lay up for yourself a good reward against the day of need; because <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> delivers from death, and does not suffer to go into darkness. Alms is a good office for all who do it in the sight of the most high God.</q>  On this same subject in Solomon in Proverbs: <q>He that has pity on the poor lends unto the Lord.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He that gives to the poor shall never want; but he who turns away his eye shall be in much penury.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Sins are purged away by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  Again, in the same place: <q>If your enemy hunger, feed him; and if he thirst, give him to drink: for by doing this you shall scatter live coals upon his head.</q>  Again, in the same place: <q>As water extinguishes fire, so <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> extinguishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  In the same in Proverbs: <q>Say not, Go away, and return, tomorrow I will give; when you can do good immediately. For you know not what may happen on the coming day.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who stops his ears that he may not hear the weak, shall himself call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there shall be none to hear him.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who has his conversation without reproach in righteousness, leaves blessed children.</q>  In the same in Ecclesiasticus: <q>My son, if you have, do good by yourself, and present worthy offerings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; remember that death delays not.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Shut up <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and this will entreat for you from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Concerning this thing in the thirty-sixth Psalm, that mercy is beneficial also to one's posterity: <q>I have been young, and I have also grown old; and I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. The whole day he is merciful, and lends; and his seed is in blessing.</q>  Of this same thing in the fortieth Psalm: <q>Blessed is he who considers over the poor and needy: in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day God will deliver him.</q>  Also in the cxith Psalm: <q>He has distributed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness shall remain from generation to generation.</q>  Of this same thing in Hosea: <q>I desire mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God more than whole burnt-offerings.</q>  Of this same thing also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be satisfied.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through and steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like a merchantman seeking goodly pearls: and when he has found a precious pearl, he went away and sold all that he had, and bought it.</q>  That even a small work is of advantage, also in the same place: <q>And whoever shall give to drink to one of the least of these a cup of cold water in the name of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, verily I say unto you, His reward shall not perish.</q>  That <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are to be denied to none, also in the same place: <q>Give to every one that asks you; and from him who would wish to borrow, be not turned away.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>If you will enter into life, keep the commandments. He says, Which? Jesus says unto him, You shall not kill, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, Honour your father and mother: and, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. The young man says unto Him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet? Jesus says unto him, If you will be perfect, go and sell all that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come in His majesty, and all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: and all nations shall be gathered together before Him; and He shall separate them one from another, even as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats: and He shall place the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left hand. Then shall the King say unto them that are on His right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in: naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer Him, and say, Lord, when saw we You  a stranger, and took You in: naked, and clothed You? And when saw we You sick, and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and came to You? And the King, answering, shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it unto me. Then shall He say unto them who are on His left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which my Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me not in: I was naked, and you clothed me not: sick, and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you visited me not. Then shall they also answer, and say, Lord, when saw we You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and did not minister unto You? And He shall answer them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not unto me. And these shall go away into everlasting burning: but the righteous into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q>  Concerning this same matter in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>Sell your possessions, and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who made that which is within, made that which is without also. But give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and, behold, all things are pure unto you.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Behold, the half of my substance I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has this day been wrought for this house, since he also is a son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q>  Of this same thing also in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>Let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be the supplement of your want, that there may be equality: as it is written, He who had much had not excess; and he who had little had no lack.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he who sows in blessing shall reap also of blessing. But let every one do as he has proposed in his heart: not as if sorrowfully, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains for ever.</q>  Likewise in the same place: <q>Now he who ministers seed to the sower, shall both supply bread to be eaten, and shall multiply your seed, and shall increase the growth of the fruits of your righteousness: that in all things you may be made rich.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The administration of this service has not only supplied that which is lacking to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but has abounded by much giving of thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Of this same matter in the Epistle of John: <q>Whoso has this world's substance, and sees his brother desiring, and shuts up his bowels from him, how dwells the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him? </q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor brethren, nor neighbours, nor the rich; lest haply they also invite you again, and a recompense be made you. But when you make a banquet, call the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the weak, the blind, and lame: and you shall be blessed; because they have not the means of rewarding you: but you I shall be recompensed in the resurrection of the I just.</q> </p>

<h2>2. In works and alms, even if by smallness of power less be done, that the will itself is sufficient</h2>

<p>In the second Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: If there be a ready will, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to that which he has not; nor let there be to others a mitigation, but to you a burdening. </p>

<h2>3. That charity and brotherly affection are to be religiously and stedfastly practised</h2>

<p>In Malachi: <q>Has not one God created us? Is there not one Father of us all? Why have you certainly deserted every one his brother? </q>  Of this same thing according to John: <q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>This is my commandment, That you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, even as I have loved you. Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this has no man, than that one should lay down his life for his friends.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Verily I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning everything, whatever you shall ask it shall be given you from my Father which is in heaven. For wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them.</q>  Of this same thing in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>And I indeed, brethren, could not speak unto you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have given you milk for drink, not meat: for while you were yet little you were not able to bear it, neither now are you able. For you are still carnal: for where there are in you emulation, and strife, and dissensions, are you not carnal, and walk after man? </q>  Likewise in the same place: <q>And if I should have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I can remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing. And if I should distribute all my goods for food, and if I should deliver up my body to be burned, but have not charity, I avail nothing. Charity is great-souled; charity is kind; charity envies not; charity deals not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; is not puffed up; is not irritated; thinks not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; rejoices not in <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, but rejoices in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It loves all things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> all things, hopes all things, bears all things. Charity shall never fail.</q>  Of this same thing to the Galatians: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. But if you bite and accuse one another, see that you be not consumed one of another.</q>  Of this same thing in the Epistle of John: <q>In this appear the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Whosoever is not righteous is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he who loves not his brother. For he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer; and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no murderer has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life abiding in him.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>If any one shall say that he loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, he is a liar: for he who loves not his brother whom he sees, how can he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God whom he sees not? </q>  Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>But the multitude of them that had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> acted with one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and mind: nor was there among them any distinction, neither did they esteem as their own anything of the possessions that they had; but all things were common to them.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: If you would offer your gift at the altar, and there rememberest that your brother has ought against you; leave your gift before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift at the altar.  Also in the Epistle of John: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> l and he that dwells in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God in him.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who says he is in the light, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, is a liar, and walks in darkness even until now.</q> </p>

<h2>4. That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>No one can receive anything, except it were given him from heaven.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>For what have you that you have not received? But if you have received it, why do you boast, as if you had not received it? </q>  Also in the first of Kings: <q>Boast not, neither speak lofty things, and let not great speeches proceed out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The bow of the mighty men has been made weak, and the weak are girt about with strength.</q>  Of this same thing in the Maccabees: <q>It is just to be subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that a mortal should not think things equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not the words of a man that is a sinner, because his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be filth and worms. Today he shall be lifted up, and tomorrow he shall not be found; because he is turned into his earth, and his thought has perished.</q> </p>

<h2>5. That humility and quietness are to be maintained in all things</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Thus says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is the stool of my feet. What seat will you build for me, or what is the place for my rest? For all those things has my hand made, and all those things are mine. And upon whom else will I look, except upon the lowly and quiet man, and him that trembles at my words? </q>  On this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</q>  Of this same thing, too, according to Luke: <q>He that shall be least among you all, the same shall be great.</q>  Also in the same lace: <q>Whosoever exalts himself shall be made low, and whosoever abases himself shall be exalted.</q>  Of this same thing to the Romans: <q>Be not high-minded, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; for if God spared not the natural branches, (take heed) lest He also spare not you.</q>  Of this same thing in the thirty-third Psalm: And He shall save the lowly in spirit.  Also to the Romans: <q>Render to all what is due: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; owe no man anything, except to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> another.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the first place of reclining at feasts, and the chief seat in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and salutations in the market, and to be called of men Rabbi. But say not Rabbi, for One is your Master.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>The servant is not greater than his lord, nor the apostle greater than He that sent himself. If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, blessed shall you be if you shall do them.</q>  Also in the eighty-first Psalm: <q>Do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the poor and lowly.</q> </p>

<h2>6. That all good and righteous men suffer more, but ought to endure because they are proved</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>The furnace proves the vessels of the potter, and the trial of tribulation righteous men.</q>  Also in the fiftieth Psalm: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God will not despise.</q>  Also in the thirty-third Psalm: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nearest to them that are contrite in heart, and He will save the lowly in spirit.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but out of them all the Lord will deliver them.</q>  Of this same matter in Job: <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked also shall I go under the earth: the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away: as it has pleased the Lord, so it is done; blessed be the name of the Lord. In all these things which happened to him Job <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in nothing with his lips in the sight of the Lord.</q>  Concerning this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</q>  Also according to John: <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you may have peace. But in the world you shall have affliction; but have confidence, for I have overcome the world.</q>  Concerning this same thing in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me, that I should not be exalted. For which thing I thrice besought the Lord, that it should depart from me. And He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you; for strength is perfected in weakness.</q>  Concerning this same thing to the Romans: <q>We <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in hope of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And not only so, but we also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in afflictions: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that affliction works patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope does not confound; because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is infused in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which is given unto us.</q>  On this same subject, according to Matthew: <q>How broad and spacious is the way which leads unto death, and many there are who go in thereby: how straight and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there are that find it!</q>  Of this same thing in Tobias: <q>Where are your righteousnesses? Behold what you suffer</q>  Also in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>In the places of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> the righteous groan; but at their ruin the righteous will abound.</q> </p>

<h2>7. That we must not grieve the Holy Spirit, whom we have received</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle to the Ephesians: <q>Grieve not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which you were sealed in the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and indignation, and clamour, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, be taken away from you.</q> </p>

<h2>8. That anger must be overcome, lest it constrain us to sin</h2>

<p>In Solomon in the Proverbs: <q>Better is a patient man than a strong man; for he who restrains his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is better than he who takes a city.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The imprudent man declares his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on the same day, but the crafty man hides away his dishonour.</q>  Of this same thing to the Ephesians: <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not. Let not the sun set upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>You have heard that it was said by the ancients, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be guilty of the judgment. But I say unto you, That every one who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall be guilty of the judgment.</q> </p>

<h2>9. That brethren ought to support one another</h2>

<p>To the Galatians: <q>Each one having others in consideration, lest you also should be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so you shall fulfil the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>10. That we must trust in God only, and in Him we must glory</h2>

<p>In Jeremiah: <q>Let not the wise man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom, neither let the strong man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his strength, nor let the rich man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his riches; but let him that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this, that he understands and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that I am the Lord, who do mercy, and judgment, and righteousness upon the earth, because in them is my pleasure, says the Lord.</q>  Of the same thing in the fifty-fourth Psalm: <q>In the Lord have I hoped; I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man can do unto me.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>To none but God alone is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subjected.</q>  Also in the cxviith Psalm: <q>I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man can do unto me; the Lord is my helper.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to trust in the Lord rather than to trust in man; it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to hope in the Lord rather than to hope in princes.</q>  Of this same thing in Daniel: <q>But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to king <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, O king, there is no need to answer you concerning this word. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. And if not, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you that we serve not your gods, and we adore not the golden image which you have set up.</q>  Likewise in Jeremiah: <q>Cursed is the man who has hope in man; and blessed is the man who trusts in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and his hope shall be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Concerning this same thing in Deuteronomy: <q>You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q>  Of this same thing to the Romans: <q>And they worshipped and served the creature, forsaking the Creator. Wherefore also God gave them up to ignominious <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</q>  Of this thing also in John: <q>Greater is He who is in you than he who is in this world.</q> </p>

<h2>11. That he who has attained to trust, having put off the former man, ought to regard only celestial and spiritual things, and to give no heed to the world which he has already renounced</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Seek the Lord; and when you have found Him, call upon Him. But when He has come near unto you, let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him be turned unto the Lord, and he shall obtain mercy, because He will plentifully pardon your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  Of this same thing in Solomon: <q>I have seen all the works which are done under the sun; and, lo, all are vanity.</q>  Of this same thing in Exodus: <q>But thus shall you eat it; your loins girt, and your shoes on your feet, and your staves in your hands: and you shall eat it in haste, for it is the Lord's passover.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? Or, What shall we drink? Or, Wherewith shall we be clothed? For these things the nations seek after. But your Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that you have need of all these things. Seek first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</q>  Likewise in the same place: <q>Think not for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for itself. Sufficient unto the day is its own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Likewise in the same place: <q>No one looking back, and putting his hands to the plough, is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Behold the fowls of the heaven: for they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of more value than they? </q>  Concerning this same thing, according to Luke: <q>Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning; and you like men that wait for their lord, when he comes from the wedding; that, when he comes and knocks, they may open to him. Blessed are those servants, whom their lord, when he comes, shall find watching.</q>  Of this same thing in Matthew: <q>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has not where He may lay His head.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Whoso forsakes not all that he has, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q>  Of this same thing in the first to the Corinthians: <q>You are not your own, for you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The time is limited. It remains, therefore, that both they who have wives be as though they have them not, and they who lament as they that lament not, and they that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as they that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not, and they who buy as they that buy not, and they who possess as they who possess not, and they who use this world as they that use it not; for the fashion of this world passes away.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The first man is of the clay of the earth, the second man from heaven. As he is of the clay, such also are they who are of the clay; and as is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly. Even as we have borne the image of him who is of the clay, let us bear His image also who is from heaven.</q>  Of this same matter to the Philippians: <q>All seek their own, and not those things which are Christ's; whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is to their confusion, who mind earthly things. For our conversation is in heaven, whence also we expect the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who shall transform the body of our humiliation conformed to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  Of this very matter to Galatians: <q>But be it far from me to boast, except in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</q>  Concerning this same thing to Timothy: <q>No man that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for God binds himself with worldly annoyances, that he may please Him to whom he has approved himself. But and if a man should contend, he will not be crowned unless he fight lawfully.</q>  Of this same thing to the Colossians: <q>If you be dead with Christ from I the elements of the world, why still, as if living in the world, do you follow vain things? </q>  Also concerning this same thing: <q>If you have risen together with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Give heed to the things that are above, not to those things which are on the earth; for you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when Christ your life shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  Of this same thing to the Ephesians: Put off the old man of the former conversation, who is corrupted, according to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of deceit. But be renewed in the spirit of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and put on the new man, him who according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ordained in righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  Of this same thing in the Epistle of Peter: <q>As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but having a good conversation among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that while they detract from you as if from evildoers, yet, beholding your good works, they may magnify God.</q>  Of this same thing in the Epistle of John: <q>He who says he abides in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. Because everything which is in the world is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the ambition of this world, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of this world. And the world shall pass away with its <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. But he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as God abides for ever.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new dough, as you are unleavened. For also Christ our passover is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not in the old leaven, nor in the leaven of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>12. That we must not swear</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>A man that swears much shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall not depart from his house; and if he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> vainly, he shall not be justified.</q>  Of this same matter, according to Matthew: <q>(Again, you have heard that it was said to them of old, You shall not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, but shall perform unto the Lord your oaths.) I say unto you, Swear not at all: (neither by heaven, because it is God's throne; nor by the earth, because it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; neither shall you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.) But let your discourse be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: (for whatever is fuller than these is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>)  Of this same thing in Exodus: <q>You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.</q> </p>

<h2>13. That we must not curse</h2>

<p>In Exodus: <q>You shall not curse nor speak ill of the ruler of your people.</q>  Also in the thirty-third Psalm: <q>Who is the man who desires life, and loves to see good days? Restrain your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips that they speak no guile.</q>  Of this same thing in Leviticus: <q>And the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, Bring forth him who has cursed abroad outside the camp; and all who heard him shall place their hands upon his head, and all the assembly of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall stone him.</q>  Of this same thing in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistle to the Ephesians: <q>Let no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> discourse proceed out of your mouth, but that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the edification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it may give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the hearers.</q>  Of this same thing to the Romans: <q>Blessing, and not cursing.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>He who shall say to his brother, You fool! shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</q>  Of this same matter, according to the same Matthew: <q>But I say unto you, That every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account for it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</q> </p>

<h2>14. That we must never murmur, but bless God concerning all things that happen</h2>

<p>In Job: <q>Say some word against the Lord, and die. But he, looking upon her, said, You speak as one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. If we have received <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from the Lord's hand, why shall we not endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things? In all these things which happened unto him, Job <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not with his lips in the sight of the Lord.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Have you regarded my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth: a man without complaint: a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restraining himself from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Of the same thing in the thirty-third Psalm: <q>I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall ever be in my mouth.</q>  Of this same thing in Numbers: <q>Let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die.</q>  Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>But about the middle of the night <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and gave thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the prisoners heard them.</q>  Also in the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Philippians: <q>But doing all things for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, without murmurings and revilings,  that you may be without complaint, and spotless sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>15. That men are tried by God for this purpose, that they may be proved</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, tempted <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said to him, Take your only son whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, Isaac, and go into the high land, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.</q>  Of this same thing in Deuteronomy: <q>The Lord your God proves you, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  Of this same thing in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>Although in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and having been in few things distressed, yet in many things they shall be happily ordered, because God tried them, and found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> them, and as a burnt-offering He received them. And in their time there shall be respect of them; they shall judge the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and shall rule over the people; and their Lord shall reign for ever.</q>  Of this same thing in the Maccabees: <q>Was not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> found faithful in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness? </q> </p>

<h2>16. Of the benefits of martyrdom</h2>

<p>In the Proverbs of Solomon: <q>The faithful <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> delivers his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Then shall the righteous stand in great boldness against them who have afflicted them, and who took away their labours. When they see them, they shall be disturbed with a horrible <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and they shall wonder at the suddenness of their unhoped-for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, saying among themselves, repenting and groaning with distress of spirit, These are they whom some time we had in derision, and in the likeness of a proverb; we fools counted their life <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and their end without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. How are they reckoned among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their lot among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>! Therefore we have wandered from the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the light of righteousness has not shined upon us, and the sun has not risen upon us. We have been wearied in the way of iniquity and of perdition, and we have walked through difficult solitudes; but we have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of the Lord. What has <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us? Or what has the boasting of riches brought to us? All these things have passed away as a shadow.</q>  Of this same thing in the cxvth Psalm: <q>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  Also in the cxxvth Psalm: <q>They who sow in tears shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Walking they walked, and wept as they cast their seeds; but coming they shall come in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, raising up their laps.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>He who loves his life shall lose it; and he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his life in this world shall find it to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought what you shall speak; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>The hour shall come, that every one that kills you shall think he does service to God l but they shall do this also because they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father nor me.</q>  Of this same matter, according to Matthew: <q>Blessed are they which shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake; for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him which is able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in Gehenna.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him also will I confess before my Father which is in heaven; but he who shall deny me before men, him also will I deny before my Father which is in heaven. And he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</q>  Of this same thing, according to Luke: <q>Blessed shall you be when men shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and shall separate you (from their company), and shall drive you out, and shall speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of your name, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man's</a> sake. Rejoice in that day, and exult; for, lo, your reward is great in heaven.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Verily I say unto you, There is no man that leaves house, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and does not receive seven times as much in this present time, but in the world to come life everlasting.</q>  Of this same thing in the Apocalypse: <q>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar of God the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain on account of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His testimony. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do You not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And unto every one of them were given white robes; and it was said to them, that they should rest still for a short time, until the number of their fellow-servants, and of their brethren, should be fulfilled, and they who shall afterwards be slain, after their example.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>After these things I saw a great crowd, which no one among them could number, from every nation, and from every tribe, and from every people and tongue, standing before the throne and before the Lamb; and they were clothed with white robes, and palms were in their hands. And they said with a loud voice, Salvation to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb. And one of the elders answered and said to me, What are these which are clothed with white robes? Who are they, and whence have they come? And I said unto him, My lord, you know. And he said unto me, These are they who have come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they are before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne shall dwell among them. They shall neither hunger nor thirst ever; and neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor shall they suffer any heat: for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall protect them, and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>He who shall overcome I will give him to eat of the tree of life, which as in the paradise of my God.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you a crown of life.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Blessed shall they be who shall watch, and shall keep their garments, lest they walk naked, and they see their shame.</q>  Of this same thing, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the second Epistle to Timothy: <q>I am now offered up, and the time of my assumption is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. There now remains for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me in that day; and not only to me, but to all also who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His appearing.</q>  Of this same thing to the Romans: <q>We are the sons of God: but if sons and heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are also joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer together, that we may also be magnified together.</q>  Of this same thing in the cxviiith Psalm: <q>Blessed are they who are undefiled in the way, and walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they who search into His testimonies.</q> </p>

<h2>17. That what we suffer in this world is of less account than is the reward which is promised</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy of comparison with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that is to come after, which shall be revealed in us.</q>  Of this same thing in the Maccabees: <q>O Lord, who hast the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is manifest that while I might be delivered from death, I am suffering most cruel pains of body, being beaten with whips; yet in spirit I suffer these things willingly, because of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of your own self.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>You indeed, being powerless, destroyest us out of this present life; but the King of the world shall raise us up who have died for His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> into the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> resurrection of life.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>It is better that, given up to death by men, we should expect hope from God to be raised again by Him. For there shall be no resurrection to life for you.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Having power among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, although you are corruptible, you do what you will. But think not that our race is forsaken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Sustain, and see how His great power will torment, you and your seed.</q>  Also in the same place: Do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for we suffer these things on our own accounts, as sinners against our God. But think not that you shall be unpunished, having undertaken to fight against God. </p>

<h2>18. That nothing is to be preferred to the love of God and Christ</h2>

<p>In Deuteronomy: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your might.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>He that loves father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me; and he that takes not up his cross and follows me, is not my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q>  Also in the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for your sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. But in all these things we are more than conquerors for His sake who loved us.</q> </p>

<h2>19. That we are not to obey our own will, but the will of God</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>I came not down from heaven to do my own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent me.</q>  Of this same matter, according to Matthew: <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.</q>  Also in the daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: <q>Your will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</q>  Also according to Matthew: <q>Not every one who says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but he who does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father which is in heaven, he shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  Also according to Luke: <q>But that servant which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his Lord's will, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, shall be beaten with many stripes.</q>  In the Epistle of John: <q>But he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as He Himself also abides for ever.</q> </p>

<h2>20. That the foundation and strength of hope and faith is fear</h2>

<p>In the cxth Psalm: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</q>  Of the same thing in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>The beginning of wisdom is to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God.</q>  Also in the Proverbs of the same: <q>Blessed is the man who reverences all things with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q>  Of the same thing [in Isaiah: <q>And upon whom else will I look, except upon him that is lowly and peaceful, and that trembles at my words? </q>  Of this same thing in Genesis: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord called him from heaven, and said unto him, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do anything unto him: for now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hast not spared your beloved son for my sake.</q>  Also in the second Psalm: <q>Serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> unto Him in trembling.</q>  Also in Deuteronomy, the word of God to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>Call the people together to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> me all the days that they themselves shall live upon the earth.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will perfect upon the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>, a new covenant: not according to the covenant that I had ordered with their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; because they have not abode in my covenant, and I have been unmindful of them, says the Lord; because this is the covenant which I will ordain for the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; After those days, says the Lord, I will give my law, and will write it in their mind and I will be to them for a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they shall be to me for a people. And they shall not teach every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord because all shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, from the least even to the greatest of them: because I will be favourable to their iniquities, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I will not remember any more. If the heaven should be lifted up on high, says the Lord, and if the earth should be made low from beneath, yet I will not cast away the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, says the Lord, for all the things which they have done. Behold, I will gather them together from every land in which I have scattered them in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and in my fury, and in great indignation; and I will grind them down into that place, and I will leave them in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and they shall be to me for a people, and I will be to them for a God: and I will give them another way, and another heart, that they may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> me all their days in prosperity with their children: and I will perfect for them an everlasting covenant, which I will not turn away after them; and I will put my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> into their heart, that they may not depart from me: and I will visit upon them to do them good, and to plant them in their land in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and with all the heart, and with all the mind.</q>  Also in the Apocalypse: <q>And the four and twenty elders which sit on their thrones in the sight (of God), fell upon their faces, and worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, We give You thanks, O Lord God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, which art and which wast; because You have taken Your great power, and have reigned. And the nations were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> has come, and the time in which it should be judged concerning the dead, and the reward should be given to Your servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Your name, small and great; and to disperse those who have corrupted the earth.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of the heaven, having the everlasting <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to preach to those who dwell upon the earth, and to all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and tribes, and tongues, and peoples, saying with a loud voice, Fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and give Him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because the hour of His judgment has come; and adore Him who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and the beasts were feeding with His lambs;  and the number of His name a hundred and forty and four, standing upon the sea of glass, having the harps of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they sing the song of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are Your works, O Lord God Almighty; just and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are Your ways, You King of the nations. Who would not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You, and give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Your name? For You only are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: and because all nations shall come and worship in Your sight, because Your righteousnesses have been made manifest.</q>  Also in Daniel: <q>There was a man dwelling in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> whose name was Joachim; and he took a wife by name Susanna, the daughter of Helchias, a very beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and one that feared the Lord. And her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>.</q>  Moreover, in Daniel: <q>And we are lowly this day in all the earth because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and there is not at this time any prince, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or leader, or burnt-offering, or oblation, or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, or place to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before You, and to find mercy from You. And yet in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spirit of lowliness let us be accepted as the burnt-offerings of rams and bulls, and as it were many thousands of lambs which are fattest. If our offering may be made in Your presence this day, their power shall be consumed, for they shall not be ashamed who put their trust in You. And now we follow with our whole heart, and we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and seek Your face. Give us not over unto reproach, but do with us according to Your tranquillity, and according to the multitude of Your mercy deliver us.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And the king exceedingly rejoiced, and commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den of lions; and the lions had done him no hurt, because he trusted and had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his God. And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel; and they cast them in the den of lions, and their wives and their children. And before they had reached the pavement of the den they were seized by the lions, and they broke all their bones in pieces. Then Darius the king wrote, To all peoples, tribes, and languages which are in my kingdom, peace be unto you from my face. I decree and ordain that all those who are in my kingdom shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and tremble before the most high God whom Daniel serves, because He is the God who lives and abides for ever, and His kingdom shall not pass away, and His dominion goes on for ever; and He alone does signs, and prodigies, and marvellous things in the heaven and the earth, who snatched Daniel from the den of lions.</q>  Also in Micah: <q>Wherewith shall I approach the Lord, and lay hold upon Him? In <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, in burnt-offerings, in calves of a year old? Does the Lord favour and receive me with thousands of fat goats? Or shall I give my <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of unrighteousness, the fruit of my belly, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? It is told you, O man, what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; or what else the Lord does require, save that you should do judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> mercy, and be ready to go with the Lord your God. The voice of the Lord shall be invoked in the city, and He will save those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> His name.</q>  Also in Micah: <q>Feed Your people with Your rod, the sheep of Your inheritance; and pluck up those who dwell separately in the midst of Carmel. They shall prepare Bashan and Gilead according to the days of the age; and according to the days of their going forth from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> I will show them wonderful things. The nations shall see, and be confounded at all their might; and they shall place their hand upon their mouth. Their ears shall be deafened, and they shall lick the dust as do serpents. Dragging the earth, they shall be disturbed, and they shall lick the dust: in their end they shall be afraid towards the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> because of You. Who is a God as You are, raising up unrighteousness, and passing over impiety? </q>  And in Nahum: <q>The mountains were moved at Him, and the hills trembled; and the earth was laid bare before His face, and all who dwell therein. From the face of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> who shall bear it, and who withstands in the fury of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? His rage causes the beginnings to flow, and the rocks were melted by Him. The Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to those who sustain Him in the day of affliction, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him.</q>  Also in Haggai: <q>And Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, and Jesus the son of Josedech, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and all who remained of the people, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the voice of the Lord their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the Lord sent him to them, and the people feared from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Also in Malachi: <q>The covenant was with life and peace; and I gave to them the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> me from the face of my name.</q>  Also in the thirty-third Psalm: <q>Fear the Lord, all you His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: for there is no want to them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him.</q>  Also in the eighteenth Psalm: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is chaste, abiding for ever.</q> </p>

<h2>21. That we must not rashly judge of another</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>Judge not, that you be not judged: condemn not, that you be not condemned.</q>  Of this same subject to the Romans: <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he shall stand; for God is able to make him stand.</q>  And again: <q>Wherefore you are without excuse, O every man that judges: for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you do the same things which you judge. But you, who judge those who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do the same, hope that you yourself shall escape the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a>.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians.: <q>And let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.</q>  And again: <q>If any man thinks that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not yet in what manner he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>22. That when we have received a wrong, we must remit and forgive it</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in the daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: <q>Forgive us our debts, even as we forgive our debtors.</q>  Also according to Mark: <q>And when you stand for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, forgive, if you have ought against any one; that also your Father who is in heaven may forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>In what measure you mete, in that shall it be measured to you again.</q> </p>

<h2>23. That evil is not to be returned for evil</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Rendering to no man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Not to be overcome of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good.</q>  Of this same thing in the Apocalypse: <q>And He said unto me, Seal not the words of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book; because now the time is at hand. And let those who persist in hurting, hurt: and let him who is filthy, be filthy still: but let the righteous do still more righteousness: and in like manner, let him that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> do still more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>24. That it is impossible to attain to the Father but by His Son Jesus Christ</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life: no man comes unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but by me.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved.</q> </p>

<h2>25. That unless a man have been baptized and born again, he cannot attain unto the kingdom of God</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. For that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Unless you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you.</q> </p>

<h2>26. That it is of small account to be baptized and to receive the Eucharist, unless one profit by it both in deeds and works</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that they which run in a race run indeed all, although one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain. And those indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</q>  In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, and in Your name have cast out devils, and in Your name have done great works? And then shall I say to them, I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you; depart from me, you who work iniquity.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q>  Also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Philippians: <q>Shine as lights in the world.</q> </p>

<h2>27. That even a baptized person loses the grace that he has attained, unless he keep innocency</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>Lo, you are made whole: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing happen unto you.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> abides in you? If any one violate the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him will God destroy.</q>  Of this same thing in the Chronicles: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with you, while you are with Him: if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.</q> </p>

<h2>28. That remission cannot in the Church be granted unto him who has sinned against God (i.e., the Holy Ghost)</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Whosoever shall say a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.</q>  Also according to Mark: <q>All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, to the sons of men; but whoever shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, but he shall be guilty of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  Of this same thing in the first book of Kings: <q>If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by offending against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord for him; but if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him? </q> </p>

<h2>29. That it was before predicted, concerning the hatred of the Name</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>And you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for my name's sake.</q>  Also according to John: <q>If the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it first <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me. If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what would be its own: but because you are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you. Remember the word which I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you.</q>  Also in Baruch:  <q>For the time shall come, and you shall seek me, both you and those who shall be after you, to hear the word of wisdom and of understanding; and you shall not find me. But the nations shall desire to see the wise man, and it shall not happen to them; not because the wisdom of this world shall be wanting, or shall fail to the earth; but neither shall the word of the law be wanting to the world. For wisdom shall be in a few who watch, and are silent and quiet, and who hold converse with one another; because some shall dread them, and shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But some do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the word of the law of the Highest. But some who are amazed in their countenance will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and they also who contradict will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and will be contrary to and hindering the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Moreover, others will be wise to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and declaring the edicts, as if of the Highest and the Strong One. Moreover, others are <em>possessors of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>.  Others are mighty and strong in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Highest, and hateful to the stranger.</q></p>

<h2>30. That what any one has vowed to God, he must quickly repay</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>According as you have vowed a vow to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, delay not to pay it.</q>  Concerning this same thing in Deuteronomy: <q>But if you have vowed a vow to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I you shall not delay to pay it: because the Lord your God inquiring shall seek it of you; and it shall be for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. You shall observe those things that shall go forth out of your lips, and shall perform the gift which you have spoken with your mouth.</q>  Of this same matter in the forty-ninth Psalm: <q>Sacrifice to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.</q>  Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>Why has <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> filled your heart, that you should lie to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when your estate was in your own power? You have not lied unto men, but unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>Cursed is he who does the work of God negligently.</q> </p>

<h2>31. That he who does not believe is judged already</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not is already judged, because he has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of the only  <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light.</q>  Of this also in the first Psalm: <q>Therefore the ungodly shall not rise up in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous.</q> </p>

<h2>32. Of the benefit of virginity and of continency</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>Multiplying I will multiply your sorrows and your groanings, and in sorrow shall you bring forth children; and your turning shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>All men do not receive the word, but they to whom it is given: for there are some eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who have been constrained by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake. He who can receive it, let him receive it.</q>  Also according to Luke: <q>The children of this world beget, and are begotten. But they who have been considered worthy of that world, and the resurrection from the dead, do not marry, nor are married: for neither shall they begin to die: for they are equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they are the children of the resurrection. But, that the dead rise again, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> intimates when he says in the bush, The Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob. He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But, on account of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> have her own husband. Let the husband render what is due to the wife, and similarly the wife to the husband. The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband. And in like manner, the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife. Defraud not one the other, except by agreement for a time, that you may have leisure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and again return to the same point, lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you on account of your incontinency. This I say by way of allowance, not by way of command. But I wish that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be even as I am. But every one has his proper gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; one in one way, but another in another way.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>An unmarried man thinks of those things which are the Lord's, in what way he may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he who has contracted marriage thinks of those things that are of this world, in what way he may please his wife. Thus also, both the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the unmarried virgin thinks of those things which are the Lord's, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit; but she that has married thinks of those things which are of this world, in what way she may please her husband.</q>  Also in Exodus, when the Lord had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that he should sanctify the people for the third day, he sanctified them, and added: <q>Be ready, for three days you shall not approach to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q>  Also in the first book of Kings: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> answered to David, and said, There are no profane loaves in my hand, except one sacred loaf. If the young men have been kept back from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they shall eat.</q>  Also in the Apocalypse: <q>These are they who have not defiled themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for they have continued <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; these are they who follow the Lamb wherever He shall go.</q> </p>

<h2>33. That the Father judges nothing, but the Son; and that the Father is not glorified by him by whom the Son is not glorified</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>The Father judges nothing, but has given all judgment unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father. He who honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the Father who has sent Him.</q>  Also in the seventy-first Psalm: <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give the king Your judgment, and Your righteousness to the king's son, to judge Your people in righteousness.</q>  Also in Genesis: <q>And the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> sulphur, and fire from heaven from the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>34. That the believer ought not to live like the Gentile</h2>

<p>In Jeremiah: <q>Thus says the Lord, Walk not according to the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  Of this same thing, that one ought to separate himself from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, lest he should be a companion of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become a partaker of their penalty, in the Apocalypse: <q>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Go forth from her, my people, lest you be partaker of her crimes, and lest you be stricken with her plagues; because her crimes have reached even to heaven, and the Lord God has remembered her iniquities. Therefore He has returned unto her double, and in the cup which she has mixed double is mingled for her; and in how much she has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> herself and possessed of delights, in so much is given unto her both torment and grief. For in her heart she says, I am a queen, and cannot be a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, nor shall I see sorrow. Therefore in one hour her plagues shall come on her, death, grief, and famine; and she shall be burned with fire, because the Lord God is strong who shall judge her. And the kings of the earth shall weep and lament themselves for her, who have committed fornication with her, and have been conversant in her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>Go forth from the midst of them, you who bear the vessels of the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>35. That God is patient for this end, that we may repent of our sin, and be reformed</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Say not, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and what sorrow has happened to me? For the Highest is a patient repayer.</q>  Also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and patience, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? But, according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you store up to yourself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and of revelation of the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who will render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>36. That a woman ought not to be adorned in a worldly fashion</h2>

<p>In the Apocalypse: <q>And there came one of the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> having vials, and approached me, saying, Come, I will show you the condemnation of the great whore, who sits upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. And I saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who sate upon a beast. And that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was clothed with a purple and scarlet robe; and she was adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand full of curses, and impurity, and fornication of the whole earth.</q>  Also to Timothy: <q>Let your <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be such as adorn themselves with shamefacedness and modesty, not with twisted hair, nor with gold, nor with pearls, or precious garments, but as becomes <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> professing <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, with a good conversation.</q>  Of this same thing in the Epistle of Peter to the people at <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>: <q>Let there be in a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> not the outward adorning of ornament, or of gold, or of apparel, but the adorning of the heart.</q>  Also in Genesis: <q>Thamar covered herself with a cloak, and adorned herself; and when Judah beheld her, she appeared to him to be a harlot.</q> </p>

<h2>37. That the believer ought not to be punished for other offenses, except for the name he bears</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of Peter to them of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>: Nor let any of you suffer as a thief, or a murderer, or as an evil-doer, or as a minder of other people's business,  but as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. </p>

<h2>38. That the servant of God ought to be innocent, lest he fall into secular punishment</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Will you not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and you shall have praise of it.</q> </p>

<h2>39. That there is given to us an example of living in Christ</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of Peter to them of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>: <q>For Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you may follow His steps; who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened not, but gave Himself up to him that judges unrighteously.</q>  Also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Philippians: <q>Who, being appointed in the figure of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> that He was equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, He was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and was found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. He humbled Himself, becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death, and the death of the cross. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also God has exalted Him, and has given Him a name, that it may be above every name, that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should be bowed, of things heavenly, and earthly, and infernal; and that every tongue should confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q>  Of this same thing in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>If I have washed your feet, being your Master and Lord, you also ought to wash the feet of others. For I have given you an example, that as I have done, you also should do to others.</q> </p>

<h2>40. That we must not labour noisily nor boastfully</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Let not your left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what your right hand does, that your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be in secret; and your Father, which sees in secret, shall render to you.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>When you do an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the streets and in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, that they may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of men. Verily I say unto you, They have fulfilled their reward.</q> </p>

<h2>41. That we must not speak foolishly and offensively</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistle to the Ephesians: <q>Foolish speaking and scurrility, which are not fitting for the occasion, let them not be even named among you.</q> </p>

<h2>42. That faith is of advantage altogether, and that we can do as much as we believe</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>And if you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, neither shall you understand.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore did you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? </q>  Also in the same place: <q>If you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Pass over from here to that place, and it shall pass over; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</q>  Also according to Mark: <q>All things whatsoever you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask for, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you shall receive them, and they shall be yours.</q>  Also in the same place: All things are possible to him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.  In Habakkuk: <q>But the righteous lives by my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  Also in Daniel: <q>Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, trusting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were delivered from the fiery flame.</q></p>

<h2>43. That he who believes can immediately obtain (i.e., pardon and peace)</h2>

<p>In the Acts of the Apostles: <q>Lo, here is water; what is there which hinders me from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Then said Philip, If you believe with all your heart, you may.</q> </p>

<h2>44. That believers who differ among themselves ought not to refer to a Gentile judge</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Dares any of you, having a matter against other, to discuss it among the unrighteous, and not among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall judge this world? </q>  And again: <q>Now indeed there is altogether a fault among you, because you have judgments one against another. Why do you not rather suffer injury? Or wherefore are you not rather defrauded? But you do wrong, and defraud, and this your brethren. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the unrighteous shall not obtain the kingdom of God? </q> </p>

<h2>45. That hope is of future things, and therefore that our faith concerning those things which are promised ought to be patient</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>We are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he hope for? But if we hope for what we see not, we hope  for it in patience.</q> </p>

<h2>46. That a woman ought to be silent in the church</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be silent in the church. But if any wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home.</q>  Also to Timothy: <q>Let a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> learn with silence, in all subjection. But I permit not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach, nor to be set over the man, but to be in silence. For <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was first formed, then Eve; and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not seduced, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was seduced.</q> </p>

<h2>47. That it arises from our fault and our desert that we suffer, and do not perceive God's help in everything</h2>

<p>In Hosea: <q>Hear the word of the Lord, you children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: because judgment is from the Lord against the inhabitants of the earth because there is neither mercy nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor acknowledgment of God upon the earth; but cursing, and lying, and slaughter, and theft, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is scattered abroad upon the earth: they mingle blood to blood. Therefore the land shall mourn, with all its inhabitants, with the beasts of the field, with the creeping things of the earth, with the birds of heaven; and the fishes of the sea shall fail: so that no man may judge, no man may refute.</q>  Of this same thing in Isaiah: <q>Is not the Lord's hand strong to save, or has He weighed down His ear that He may not hear? But your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> separate between you and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and on account of your iniquities He turns away His face from you, lest He should pity. For your hands are polluted with blood, and your fingers with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and your lips have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and your tongue devises unrighteousness. No one speaks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things, neither is judgment <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. They trust in vanity, and speak emptiness, who conceive sorrow, and bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q>  Also in Zephaniah: <q>In failing, let it fail from the face of the earth, says the Lord. Let man fail, and cattle; let the birds of heaven fail, and the fishes of the sea; and I will take away the unrighteous from the face of the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>48. That we must not take usury</h2>

<p>In the thirteenth Psalm:  <q>He that has not given his money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and has not received gifts concerning the innocent. He who does these things shall not be moved for ever.</q>  Also in Ezekiel: <q>But the man who will be righteous, shall not oppress a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and shall return the pledge of the debtor, and shall not commit rapine, and shall give his bread to the hungry, and shall cover the naked, and shall not give his money for <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>.</q>  Also in Deuteronomy: <q>You shall not lend to your brother with <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of money, and with <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of victuals.</q> </p>

<h2>49. That even our enemies must be loved</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, what reward do you have? For even sinners <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them.</q>  Also according to Matthew: <q>Love your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, that you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who makes His sun to rise upon the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and gives rain upon the righteous and the unrighteous.</q> </p>

<h2>50. That the sacrament of faith must not be profaned</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in the Proverbs: <q>Say not anything in the ears of a foolish man; lest, when he hears it, he may mock your wise words.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs; neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest perchance they trample them down with their feet, and turn again and crush you.</q> </p>

<h2>51. That no one should be uplifted in his labour</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Extol not yourself in doing your work.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>Which of you, having a servant ploughing, or a shepherd, says to him when he comes from the field, Pass forward and recline? But he says to him, Make ready somewhat that I may sup, and gird yourself, and minister to me, until I eat and drink; and afterwards you shall eat and drink? Does he thank that servant because he has done what was commanded him? So also you, when you shall have done that which is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we had to do.</q> </p>

<h2>52. That the liberty of believing or of not believing is placed in free choice</h2>

<p>In Deuteronomy: <q>Lo, I have set before your face life and death, good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Choose for yourself life, that you may live.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>And if you be willing, and hear me, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you be unwilling, and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>The kingdom of God is within you.</q> </p>

<h2>53. That he secrets of God cannot be seen through, and therefore that our faith ought to be simple</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>We see now through the glass in an enigma, but then with face to face. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> partly; but then I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as also I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q>  Also in Solomon, in Wisdom: <q>And in simplicity of heart seek Him.</q>  Also in the same: <q>He who walks with simplicity, walks trustfully.</q>  Also in the same: <q>Seek not things higher than yourself, and look not into things stronger than yourself.</q>  Also in Solomon: <q>Be not excessively righteous, and do not reason more than is required.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>Woe unto them who are convicted in themselves.</q>  Also in the Maccabees: <q>Daniel in his simplicity was delivered from the mouth of tile lions.</q>  Also in the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How incomprehensible are His judgments, and how unsearchable are His ways! For who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? Because from Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever.</q>  Also to Timothy: <q>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they generate strifes. But the servant of God ought not to strive, but to be gentle towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>54. That no one is without filth and without sin</h2>

<p>In Job: <q>For who is pure from filth? Not one; even if his life be of one day on the earth.</q>  Also in the fiftieth Psalm: <q>Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has my mother conceived me.</q>  Also in the Epistle of John: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> </p>

<h2>55. That we must not please men, but God</h2>

<p>In the fifty-second Psalm: <q>They that please men are confounded, because God has made them nothing.</q>  Also in the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Galatians: <q>If I wished to please men, I should not be the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>56. That nothing that is done is hidden from God</h2>

<p>In the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>In every place the eyes of God look upon the good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>I am a God at hand, and not a God afar off. If a man should be hidden in the secret place, shall I not therefore see him? Do not I fill heaven and earth? Says the Lord.</q>  Also in the first of Kings: <q>Man looks on the face, but God on the heart.</q>  Also in the Apocalypse: <q>And all the churches shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the searcher of the reins and heart; and I will give to every one of you according to his works.</q>  Also in the eighteenth Psalm: <q>Who understands his faults? Cleanse me from my secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, O Lord.</q>  Also in the second Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>We must all be manifested before the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may bear again the things which belong to his own body, according to what he has done, whether good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>57. That the believer is amended and reserved</h2>

<p>In the cxviith Psalm: <q>The Lord amending has amended me, and has not delivered me to death.</q>  Also in the eighty-eighth Psalm: <q>I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with scourges. But my mercy will I not scatter away from them.</q>  Also in Malachi: <q>And He shall sit melting and purifying, as it were, gold and silver; and He shall purify the sons of Levi.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>You shall not go out thence until you pay the uttermost farthing.</q> </p>

<h2>58. That no one should be made sad by death; since in living is labour and peril, in dying peace and the certainty of resurrection</h2>

<p>In Genesis: <q>Then said the Lord to Adam, Because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of that tree of which alone I commanded you that you should not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all your works; in sadness and groaning shall you eat of it all the days of your life: thorns and thistles shall it cast forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of your brow. You shall eat your bread until you return unto the earth from which also you were taken; because earth you are, and to earth you shall go.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was not found afterwards: because God translated him.</q>  And in Isaiah: <q>All flesh is grass, and all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of it as the flower of grass. The grass withered, and the flower has fallen away; but the word of the Lord abides for ever.</q>  In Ezekiel: <q>They say, Our bones have become dry, our hope has perished: we have expired. Therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord, Behold, I open your monuments, and I will bring you forth from your monuments, and I will bring you into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and I will put my Spirit upon you, and you shall live; and I will place you into your land: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I the Lord have spoken, and will do it, says the Lord.</q>  Also in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>He was taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should change his understanding; for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Also in the eighty-third Psalm: <q>How beloved  are your dwellings, You Lord of hosts? My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desires and hastes to the courts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And in the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Thessalonians: <q>But we would not that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning those who sleep, that you sorrow not as others which have no hope. For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died and rose again, so also them which have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.</q>  Also in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>You fool, that which you sow is not quickened except it have first died.</q>  And again: <q>Star differs from star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: so also the resurrection. The body is sown in corruption, it rises without corruption; it is sown in ignominy, it rises again in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; it is sown in weakness, it rises again in power; it is sown an animal body, it rises again a spiritual body.</q>  And again: <q>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then shall come to pass the word that is written, Death is absorbed Into striving. Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O death, is your striving? </q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>Father, I will that those whom You have given me be with me where I shall be, and may see my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You have given me before the foundation of the world.</q>  Also according to Luke: <q>Now let Your servant depart in peace, O Lord, according to the word; for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q>  Also according to John: <q>If you loved me, you would <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.</q> </p>

<h2>59. Of the idols which the Gentiles think to be gods</h2>

<p>In the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>All the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the nations they counted gods, which neither have the use of their eyes for seeing, nor their nostrils to receive breath, nor their ears for hearing, nor the fingers on their hands for handling; but their feet also are slow to walk. For man made them; and he who has borrowed his breath, he fashioned them. But no man will be able to fashion a god like to himself. For since he is mortal, he fashions a dead thing with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands. But he himself is better than they whom he worships, since he indeed lived, but they never.</q>  On this same matter: <q>Neither have they who have regarded the works <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who was the artificer, but have thought that either fire, or wind, or the rapid air, or the circle of the stars, or the abundant water, or the sun and moon, were the gods that rule over the world; and if, on account of the beauty of these, they have thought thus, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much more beautiful than these is the Lord; or if they have admired their powers and operations, let them perceive from these very things that He who has established these mighty things is stronger than they.</q>  Also in the cxxxivth Psalm: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have a mouth, and speak not; they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; and neither is there any breath in their mouth. Let them who make them become like them, and all those who trust in them.</q>  Also in the ninety-fifth Psalm: <q>All the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but the Lord made the heavens.</q>  Also in Exodus: <q>You shall not make unto yourselves gods of silver nor of gold.</q>  And again: <q>You shall not make to yourself an idol, nor the likeness of any thing.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>Thus says the Lord, Walk not according to the ways of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; for they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those things in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because the lawful things of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are vain. Wood cut out from the forest is made. the work of the carpenter, and melted silver and gold are beautifully arranged: they strengthen them with hammers and nails, and they shall not be moved, for they are fixed. The silver is brought from Tharsis, the gold comes from Moab. All things are the works of the artificers; they will clothe it with blue and purple; lifting them, they will carry them, because they will not go forward. Be not afraid of them, because they do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, neither is there good in them. Say thus, The gods that have not made the heaven and the earth perish from the earth, and from under this heaven. The heaven has trembled at this, and has shuddered much more vehemently, says the Lord. These <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things has my people done. They have forsaken the fountain of living water, and have dug out for themselves worn-out wells, which could not hold water. Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has smitten you, and your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall accuse you. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and see that it shall be a bitter thing for you that you have forsaken me, says the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you have not hoped in me, says your Lord. Because of old time you have resented my yoke, and have broken your bonds, and have said, I will not serve, but I will go upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, and upon every shady tree: there I will be confounded with fornication. To the wood and to the stone they have said, You are my father; and to the stone, You have begotten me: and they turned to me their back, and not their face.</q>  In Isaiah: <q>The dragon has fallen or is dissolved; their carved works have become as beasts and cattle. Labouring and hungry, and without strength, you shall bear them bound upon your neck as a heavy burden.</q>  And again: <q>Gathered together, they shall not be able to be saved from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; but they themselves have been led captive with you.</q>  And again: <q>To whom have you likened me? See and understand that you <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in your heart, who lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, bringing it up to the weight. The workmen have made with their hand the things made; and, bowing themselves, they have adored it, and have raised it on their shoulders: and thus they walked. But if they should place them down, they will abide in their place, and will not be moved; and they will not hear those who cry unto them: they will not save them from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>The Lord, who made heaven and earth, in strength has ordered the world, in His wisdom has stretched forth the heaven, and the multitude of the waters in the heaven. He has brought out the clouds from the end of the earth, the lightnings in the clouds; and He has brought forth the winds from His treasures. Every man is made foolish by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, every artificer is confounded by his graven images; because he has molten a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>: there is no breath in them. The works shut up in them are made vain; in the time of their consideration they shall perish.</q>  And in the Apocalypse: <q>And the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded with his trumpet. And I heard one of the four corners of the golden ark, which is in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who had the trumpet, Loose the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which are bound upon the great river Euphrates. And the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men; and the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred thousand of thousand: I heard the number of them. And then I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sate upon them, having breastplates of fire, and of hyacinth, and of sulphur: and the heads of the horses (as the heads of lions); and out of their mouth went fire, and smoke, and sulphur. By these three plagues the third part of men was slain, by the fire, and the smoke, and the sulphur which went forth from their mouth, and is in their tails: for their tails were like eels; for they had heads, and with them they do mischief. And the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues, nor repented of the works of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of their hands, that they should not worship <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, that is, images of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can neither see nor walk, repented not also of their, murders.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>And the third <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and has received his mark in his forehead or upon his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and shall be punished with fire and sulphur, under the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and under the eyes of the Lamb; and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever.</q> </p>

<h2>60. That too great lust of food is not to be desired</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. This <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not be remitted to you even until you die.</q>  Also in Exodus: <q>And the people sate down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</q>  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the first to the Corinthians: <q>Meat commends us not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we eat not shall we want.</q>  . And again: <q>When you come together to eat, wait one for another. If any is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.</q>  Also to the Romans: <q>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>I have meat which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of. My meat is, that I should do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> who sent me, and should finish His work.</q> </p>

<h2>61. That the lust of possessing, and money, are not to be sought for</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver.</q>  Also in Proverbs: <q>He who holds back the grain is cursed among the people; but blessing is on the head of him that communicates it.</q>  Also in Isaiah: Woe unto them who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may take away something from their neighbour. Will you dwell alone upon the earth?  Also in Zephaniah: <q>They shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them; and they shall appoint vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them, because the day of the Lord is near.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>For what does it profit a man to make a gain of the whole world, but that he should lose himself? </q>  And again: <q>But the Lord said unto him, You fool, this night your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is required of you. Whose, then, shall those things be which you have provided? </q>  And again: <q>Remember that you have received your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in this life. and likewise Lazarus <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. But now he is besought, and you grieve.</q>  And in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>But Peter said unto him, Silver and gold indeed I have not; but what I have I give unto you: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, rise up and walk. And, taking hold of his right hand, he lifted him up.</q>  Also in the first to Timothy: <q>We brought nothing into this world, but neither can we take anything away. Therefore, having maintenance and clothing, let us with these be content. But they who will become rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and a snare, and many and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which drown man in perdition and destruction. For the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a>, have made shipwreck from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have plunged themselves in many sorrows.</q> </p>

<h2>62. That marriage is not to be contracted with Gentiles</h2>

<p>In Tobias: <q>Take a wife from the seed of your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and take not a strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not of the tribe of your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>.</q>  Also in Genesis, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> sends his servant to take from his seed Rebecca, for his son Isaac. Also in Esdras, it was not sufficient for God when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were laid waste, unless they forsook their foreign wives, with the children also whom they had begotten of them. Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is bound so long as her husband lives; but if he die, she is freed to marry whom she will, only in the Lord. But she will be happier if she abide thus.</q>  And again: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I take the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and make them the members of an harlot? Far be it from me. Or do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he who is joined together with an harlot is one body? For two shall be in one flesh. But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</q>  Also in the second to the Corinthians: <q>Be not joined together with unbelievers. For what participation is there between righteousness and unrighteousness? Or what communication has light with darkness? </q>  Also concerning Solomon in the third book of Kings: <q>And foreign wives turned away his heart after their gods.</q> </p>

<h2>63. That the sin of fornication is grievous</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatsoever a man does is outside the body; but he who commits fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his own body. You are not your own, for you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear the Lord in your body.</q> </p>

<h2>64. What are those carnal things which beget death, and what are the spiritual things which lead to life</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Galatians: <q>The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the Spirit against the flesh: for these are contrary the one to the other, that you cannot do even those things which you wish. But the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh are manifest, which are: adulteries, fornications, impurities, filthiness, idolatries, sorceries, murders, hatreds, strifes, emulations, animosities, provocations, hatreds, dissensions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like: with respect to which I declare, that they who do such things shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But the fruit of the Spirit is charity, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, magnanimity, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, gentleness, continency, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For they who are Christ's have crucified their flesh, with its <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>65. That all sins are put away in baptism</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Neither fornicators, nor those who serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor the lusters after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor thieves, nor cheaters, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, shall obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And these things indeed you were: but you are washed, but you are sanctified in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of our God.</q> </p>

<h2>66. That the discipline of God is to be observed in Church precepts</h2>

<p>In Jeremiah: <q>And I will give to you shepherds according to my own heart; and they shall feed the sheep, feeding them with discipline.</q>  Also in Solomon, in the Proverbs: <q>My son neglect not the discipline of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor fail when rebuked by Him. For whom God loves, He rebukes.</q>  Also in the second Psalm: <q>Keep discipline, lest perchance the Lord should be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and you perish from the right way, when His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shall burn up quickly against you. Blessed are all they who trust in Him.</q>  Also in the forty-ninth Psalm: <q>But to the sinner says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, For what do you set forth my judgments, and takest my covenant into your mouth? But you hate discipline, and have cast my words behind you.</q>  Also in the Wisdom of Solomon: <q>He who casts away discipline is miserable.</q> ]</p>

<h2>67. That it was foretold that men should despise sound discipline</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the second to Timothy: <q>There will be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine; but according to their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> will heap to themselves teachers itching in hearing, tickling their ears; and shall turn away their hearing indeed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but they shall be converted unto fables.</q> ]</p>

<h2>68. That we must depart from him who lives irregularly and contrary to discipline</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Thessalonians: <q>But we have commanded you, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that you depart from all brethren who walk disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they have received from us.</q>  Also in the forty-ninth Psalm: <q>If you saw a thief, at once you ran with him, and placed your portion with the adulterers.</q> ]</p>

<h2>69. That the kingdom of God is not in the wisdom of the world, nor in eloquence, but in the faith of the cross, and in virtue of conversation</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Christ sent me to preach, not in wisdom of discourse, lest the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should become of no effect. For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who perish; but to those who are saved it is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will reprove the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of this world? Since indeed, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the world by wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> desire signs, and the Greeks seek for wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> indeed a stumbling-block, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness; but to them that are called, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And again <q>Let no man deceive himself. If any man think that he is wise among you, let him become a fool to this world, that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written, You shall rebuke the wise in their own craftiness.</q>  And again: <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the wise, that they are foolish.</q> </p>

<h2>70. That we must obey parents</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Ephesians: <q>Children, be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>: for this is right. Honour your father and your mother (which is the first command with promise), that it may be well with you, and you may be long-lived on the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>71. And that fathers also should not be harsh in respect of their children</h2>

<p>Also in the same place: <q>And, you fathers, drive not your children to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: but nourish them in the discipline and rebuke of the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>72. That servants, when they have believed, ought to serve their carnal masters the better</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Ephesians: <q>Servants, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your fleshly masters with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, and ill simplicity of your heart. as to Christ; not serving for the eye, as if you were pleasing men; but as servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>73. Moreover, that masters should be the more gentle</h2>

<p>Also in the same place: <q>And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that both your Master and theirs is in heaven; and there is no choice of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with Him.</q> </p>

<h2>74. That all widows that are approved are to be held in honour</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to Timothy: <q>Honour <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> that is wanton, is dead while she lives.</q>  And again: <q>But the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> pass by: for when they shall be wanton in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they wish to marry; having judgment, because they have cast off their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>75. That every person ought to have care rather of his own people, and especially of believers</h2>

<p>The apostle in his first Epistle to Timothy: <q>But if any take not care of his own, and especially of those of his own household, he denies the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</q>  Of this same thing in Isaiah: <q>If you shall see the naked, clothe him; and despise not those who are of the household of your own seed.</q>  Of which members of the household it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>If they have called the master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, how much rather them of his household!</q> </p>

<h2>76. That an elder must not be rashly accused</h2>

<p>In the first to Timothy: <q>Against an eider receive not all accusation.</q> </p>

<h2>77. That the sinner must be publicly reproved</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to Timothy: <q>Rebuke them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the presence of all, that others also may be afraid.</q> </p>

<h2>78. That we must not speak with heretics</h2>

<p>To Titus: <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after one rebuke avoid; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that one of such sort is perverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is by his own self condemned.</q>  Of this same thing in the Epistle of John: <q>They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would doubtless have remained with us.</q>  Also in the second to Timothy: <q>Their word does creep as a canker.</q> </p>

<h2>79. That innocency asks with confidence, and obtains</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of John: <q>If our heart blame us not, we have confidence towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and whatever we ask, we shall receive from Him.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God.</q>  Also in the twenty-third Psalm: <q>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place? The innocent in hands and of a pure heart.</q> </p>

<h2>80. That the devil has no power against man unless God have allowed it</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John: <q>Jesus said, You could have no power against me, unless it were given you from above.</q>  Also in the third of Kings: <q>And God stirred up <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> against Solomon himself.</q>  Also in Job, first of all God permitted, and then it was allowed to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the Lord first permitted, by saying to Judas, <q>What you do, do quickly.</q>  Also in Solomon, in the Proverbs: <q>The heart of the king is in God's hand.</q> </p>

<h2>81. That wages be quickly paid to the hireling</h2>

<p>In Leviticus: <q>The wages of your hireling shall not sleep with you until the morning.</q> </p>

<h2>82. That divination must not be used</h2>

<p>In Deuteronomy: <q>Do not use omens nor auguries.</q> </p>

<h2>83. That a tuft of hair is not to be worn on the head</h2>

<p>In Leviticus: <q>You shall not make a tuft from the hair of your head.</q> </p>

<h2>84. That the beard must not be plucked</h2>

<p><q>You shall not deface the figure of your beard.</q> </p>

<h2>85. That we must rise when a bishop or a presbyter comes</h2>

<h2>86. That a schism must not be made, even although he who withdraws should remain in one faith, and in the same tradition</h2>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus, in Solomon: <q>He that cleaves firewood shall be endangered by it if the iron shall fall off.</q>  Also in Exodus: <q>In one house shall it be eaten: you shall not cast forth the flesh abroad out of the house.</q>  Also in the cxxxiid Psalm: <q>Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is that brethren should dwell in unity!</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>But I beseech you, brethren, by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that you all say the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be all joined together in the same mind and in the same opinion.</q>  Also in the sixty-seventh Psalm: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who makes men to dwell with one mind in a house.</q> </p>

<h2>87. That believers ought to be simple, with prudence</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> as serpents, and simple as doves.</q>  And again: <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth. But if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> have lost his savour, in what shall it be salted? It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for nothing, but to be cast out abroad, and to be trodden under foot of men.</q> </p>

<h2>88. That a brother must not be deceived</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Thessalonians: <q>That a man do not deceive his brother in a matter, because God is the avenger for all these.</q> </p>

<p>The apostle says: <q>The day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night. When they shall say, Peace and security, then on them shall come sudden destruction.</q>  Also in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>No one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or the seasons which the Father has placed in His own power.</q> </p>

<h2>90. That a wife must not depart from her husband; or if she should depart, she must remain unmarried</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>But to them that are married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not be separated from her husband; but if she should depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and that the husband should not put away his wife.</q> </p>

<h2>91. That every one is tempted so much as he is able to bear</h2>

<p>In the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: No <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> shall take you, except such is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it. </p>

<h2>92. That not everything is to be done which is lawful</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful, but all things edify not.</q> </p>

<p>In Leviticus: <q>But whatever <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall eat of the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is the Lord's, and his uncleanness is still upon him, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall perish from his people.</q>  Also in the first to the Corinthians: <q>Whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>95. That we are to live with the good, but to avoid the evil</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in the Proverbs: <q>Bring not the impious man into the habitation of the righteous.</q>  Also in the same, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Let righteous men be your guests.</q>  And again: <q>The faithful friend is a medicine of life and of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Be far from the man who has the power to slay, and you shall not suspect <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q>  Also in the same place,: <q>Blessed is he who finds a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend, and who speaks righteousness to the listening ear.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Hedge your ears with thorns, and hear not a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tongue.</q>  Also in the seventeenth Psalm: <q>With the righteous You shall be justified; and with the innocent man You shall be innocent; and with the froward man You shall be froward.</q>  Also in the first Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians: <q>Evil communications corrupt good dispositions.</q> </p>

<h2>96. That we must labour not with words, but with deeds</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Be not hasty in your tongue, and in your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> useless and remiss.</q>  And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the first to the Corinthians: <q>The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</q>  Also to the Romans: <q>Not the hearers of the law are righteous before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>He who shall do and teach so, shall be called greatest in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>Every one who hears my words, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon a rock. The rain descended, the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one who hears my words, and does them not, I will liken him to the foolish man, who built his house upon the sand. The rain descended, the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and its ruin became great.</q> </p>

<h2>97. That we must hasten to faith and to attainment</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Delay not to be converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not put off from day to day; for His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> comes suddenly.</q> </p>

<h2>98. That the catechumen ought now no longer to sin</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>Let us do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> until the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things come; whose condemnation is just.</q> </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Romans: <q>As many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> without law, shall perish without law; and as many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the law, shall be judged also by the law.</q> </p>

<h2>100. That the grace of God ought to be without price</h2>

<p>In the Acts of the Apostles: <q>Your money be in perdition with yourself, because you have thought that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is possessed by money.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Freely you have received, freely give.</q>  Also in the same place: <q>You have made my Father's house a house of merchandise; and you have made the house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> a den of thieves.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>You who thirst, go to the water, and as many as have not money: go, and buy, and drink without money.</q>  Also in the Apocalypse: <q>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsts from the fountain of the water of life freely.

<h2>101. That the Holy Spirit has frequently appeared in fire</h2>

<p>In Exodus: <q>And the whole of Mount Sinai smoked, because God had come down upon it in fire.</q>  Also in the Acts of the Apostles<q>And suddenly there was made a sound from heaven, as if a vehement blast were borne along, and it filled the whole of that place in which they were sitting. And there appeared to them cloven tongues as if of fire, which also settled upon each of them; and they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, whatsoever God accounted accepted, fire descended from heaven, which consumed what was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. In Exodus: <q>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire from the bush.</q> </p>

<h2>102. That all good men ought willingly to hear rebuke</h2>

<p>In Solomon, in the Proverbs: <q>He who reproves a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by him. Rebuke a wise man, and he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you.</q> </p>

<h2>103. That we must abstain from much speaking</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>Out of much speaking you shall not escape <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but sparing your lips, you shall be wise.</q> </p>

<h2>104. That we must not lie</h2>

<p><q>Lying lips are an abomination to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>105. That they are frequently to be corrected who do wrong in domestic duty</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>He who spares the rod, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his son.</q>  And again: <q>Do not cease from correcting the child.</q> </p>

<h2>106. That when a wrong is received, patience is to be maintained, and vengeance to be left to God</h2>

<p>Say not, I will avenge me of mine enemy; but wait for the Lord, that He may be your help.  Also elsewhere: <q>To me belongs vengeance; I will repay, says the Lord.</q>  Also in Zephaniah: <q>Wait on me, says the Lord, in the day of my rising again to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; because my judgment is to the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that I may take kings, and pour out upon them my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>107. That we must not use detraction</h2>

<h2>110. That tale-bearers are accursed</h2>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus, in Solomon: <q>The talebearer and the double-tongued is accursed; for he will disturb many who have peace.</q> </p>

<h2>111. That the sacrifices of the wicked are not acceptable</h2>

<p>In the same: <q>The Highest approves not the gifts of the unrighteous.</q> </p>

<h2>112. That those are more severely judged, who in this world have had more power</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>The hardest judgment shall be made on those who govern. For to a mean man mercy is granted; but the powerful shall suffer torments mightily.</q>  Also in the second Psalm <q>And now, you kings, understand; be amended, you who judge the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>113. That the widow and orphans ought to be protected</h2>

<p>In Solomon: <q>Be merciful to the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> as a father, and as a husband to their mother; and you shall be the son of the Highest if you shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q>  Also in Exodus: <q>You shall not afflict any <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and orphan. But if you afflict them, and they cry out and call unto me, I will hear their cryings, and will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in mind against you; and I will destroy you with the sword, and your wives shall be <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and your children <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>.</q>  Also in Isaiah: <q>Judge for the fatherless, and justify the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; and come let us reason, says the Lord.</q>  Also in Job: have preserved the poor man from the hand of the mighty, and I have helped the fatherless who had no helper: the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> has blessed me.  Also in the sixty-seventh Psalm: <q>The Father of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and the Judge of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>114. That one ought to make confession while he is in the flesh</h2>

<p>In the fifth Psalm: <q>But in the grave who will confess unto You? </q>  Also in the twenty-ninth Psalm: <q>Shall the dust make confession to You? </q>  Also elsewhere that confession is to be made: <q>I would rather have the repentance of the sinner than his death.</q>  Also in Jeremiah: <q>Thus says the Lord, Shall not he that falls arise? Or shall not he that is turned away be converted? </q> </p>

<h2>115. That flattery is pernicious</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>They who call you blessed, lead you into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and trouble the paths of your feet.</q> </p>

<h2>116. That God is more loved by him who has had many sins forgiven in baptism</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke: <q>To whom much is forgiven, he loves much; and to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</q> </p>

<h2>117. That there is a strong conflict to be waged against the devil, and that therefore we ought to stand bravely, that we may be able to conquer</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Ephesians: <q>Our wrestle is not against flesh and blood, but against the powers and princes of this world, and of this darkness; against the spiritual things of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the heavenly places. Because of this, put on the whole armour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be able to resist in the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day; that when you have accomplished all, you may stand, having your loins girt in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, and having your feet shod with the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of peace; in all things taking the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in which you may extinguish all the fiery darts of the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one; and take the helmet of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>118. Also of Antichrist, that he will come as a man</h2>

<p>In Isaiah: <q>This is the man who arouses the earth, who disturbs kings, who makes the whole earth a desert.</q> ]</p>

<h2>119. That the yoke of the law was heavy, which is cast off by us, and that the Lord's yoke is easy, which is taken up by us</h2>

<p>In the second Psalm: <q>Wherefore have the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> been in tumult, and the peoples meditated vain things? The kings of the earth have stood up, and their princes have been gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away from us their yoke.</q>  Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew: <q>Come unto me, you who labour and are burdened, and I will make you to rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly of heart,  and you shall find rest for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For my yoke is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and my burden is light.</q>  Also in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and to us, to impose upon you no other burden than those things which are of necessity, that you should abstain from idolatries, from shedding of blood, and from fornication. And whatsoever you would not to be done unto you, do not to others.</q> </p>

<h2>120. That we are to be urgent in prayers</h2>

<p>In the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Colossians: <q>Be instant in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and watch therein.</q>  Also in the first Psalm: <q>But in the law of the Lord is his will, and in His law will he meditate day and night.</q> </p>
