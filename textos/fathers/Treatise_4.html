<h1>Treatise 4</h1>

 <p><strong>On the Lord's Prayer.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; The Treatise of Cyprian on the Lord's Prayer Comprises Three Portions, in Which Division He Imitates <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in His Book on Prayer, in the First Portion, He Points Out that the Lord's Prayer is the Most Excellent of All Prayers, Profoundly Spiritual, and Most Effectual for Obtaining Our Petitions. In the Second Part, He Undertakes an Explanation of the Lord's Prayer; And, Still Treading in the Footsteps of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, He Goes Through Its Seven Chief Clauses, Finally, in the Third Part, He Considers the Conditions of Prayer, and Tells Us What Prayer Ought to Be.</span>  &mdash; </p>

<p>1. The evangelical precepts, beloved brethren, are nothing else than divine teachings&mdash;foundations on which hope is to be built, supports to strengthen <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nourishments for cheering the heart, rudders for guiding our way, guards for obtaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash;which, while they instruct the docile minds of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> on the earth, lead them to heavenly kingdoms. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, moreover, willed many things to he said and to be heard by means of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> His servants; but how much greater are those which the Son speaks, which the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> who was in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> testifies with His own voice; not now bidding to prepare the way for His coming, but Himself coming and opening and showing to us the way, so that we who have before been wandering in the darkness of death, without forethought and blind, being enlightened by the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, might keep the way of life, with the Lord for our ruler and guide!</p>

<p>2. He, among the rest of His salutary admonitions and divine precepts wherewith He counsels His people for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, Himself also gave a form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>&mdash; Himself advised and instructed us what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for. He who made us to live, taught us also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, with that same benignity, to wit, wherewith He has condescended to give and confer all things else; in order that while we speak to the Father in that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication which the Son has taught us, we may be the more easily heard. Already He had foretold that the hour was coming <q>when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers should worship the Father in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053248"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;4:23</a></span> and He thus fulfilled what He before promised, so that we who by His sanctification  have received the Spirit and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may also by His teaching worship <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and spiritually. For what can be a more spiritual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> than that which was given to us by Christ, by whom also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was given to us? What <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the Father can be more truthful than that which was delivered to us by the Son who is the Truth, out of His own mouth? So that to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> otherwise than He taught is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> alone, but also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; since He Himself has established, and said, <q>You reject the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may keep your own traditions.</q> </p>

<p>3. Let us therefore, brethren beloved, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as God our Teacher has taught us. It is a loving and friendly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to beseech God with His own word, to come up to His ears in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let the Father acknowledge the words of His Son when we make our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and let Him also who dwells within in our breast Himself dwell in our voice. And since we have Him as an Advocate with the Father for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, let us, when as sinners we petition on behalf of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, put forward the words of our Advocate. For since He says, that <q>whatsoever we shall ask of the Father in His name, He will give us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053251"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;16:23</a></span> how much more effectually do we obtain what we ask in Christ's name, if we ask for it in His own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>! </p>

<p>4. But let our speech and petition when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> be under discipline, observing quietness and modesty. Let us consider that we are standing in God's sight. We must please the divine eyes both with the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of body and with the measure of voice. For as it is characteristic of a shameless man to be noisy with his cries, so, on the other hand, it is fitting to the modest man to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with moderated petitions. Moreover, in His teaching the Lord has bidden us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in secret&mdash; in hidden and remote places, in our very bed-chambers&mdash; which is best suited to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God is everywhere present, and hears and sees all, and in the plenitude of His majesty penetrates even into hidden and secret places, as it is written, <q>I am a God at hand, and not a God afar off. If a man shall hide himself in secret places, shall I not then see him? Do not I fill heaven and earth? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053253"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:23-24</a></span> And again: <q>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053254"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;15:3</a></span> And when we meet together with the brethren in one place, and celebrate divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> with God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, we ought to be mindful of modesty and discipline&mdash; not to throw abroad our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> indiscriminately, with unsubdued voices, nor to cast to God with tumultuous wordiness a petition that ought to be commended to God by modesty; for God is the hearer, not of the voice, but of the heart. Nor need He be clamorously reminded, since He sees men's thoughts, as the Lord proves to us when He says, <q>Why do you think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053255"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse4">Matthew 9:4</a></span> And in another place: <q>And all the churches shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am He that searches the hearts and reins.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053256"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse23">Revelation 2:23</a></span></p>

<p>5. And this Hannah in the first book of Kings, who was a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, maintains and observes, in that she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to God not with clamorous petition, but silently and modestly, within the very recesses of her heart. She spoke with hidden <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but with manifest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. She spoke not with her voice, but with her heart, because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that thus God hears; and she effectually obtained what she sought, because she asked it with belief. Divine Scripture asserts this, when it says, <q>She spoke in her heart, and her lips moved, and her voice was not heard; and God did hear her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053257"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse13">1 Samuel 1:13</a></span> We read also in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Speak in your hearts, and in your beds, and be pierced.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, moreover, suggests these same things by Jeremiah, and teaches, saying, <q>But in the heart ought God to be adored by you.</q> </p>

<p>6. And let not the worshipper, beloved brethren, be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in what manner the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> in the temple. Not with eyes lifted up boldly to heaven, nor with hands proudly raised; but beating his breast, and testifying to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shut up within, he implored the help of the divine mercy. And while the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> was pleased with himself, this man who thus asked, the rather deserved to be sanctified, since he placed the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> not in the confidence of his innocence, because there is none who is innocent; but confessing his sinfulness he humbly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and He who pardons the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heard the petitioner. And these things the Lord records in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>Two men went up into the temple to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; the one a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, and the other a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> stood, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus with himself: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I thank You that I am not as other men are, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, extortioners, adulterers, even as this <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>. I fast twice in the week, I give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all that I possess. But the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> stood afar off, and would not so much as lift up his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be merciful to me a sinner. I say unto you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and whosoever <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053260"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse10">Luke 18:10-14</a></span></p>

<p>7. These things, beloved brethren, when we have learned from the sacred reading, and have gathered in what way we ought to approach to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, let us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also from the Lord's teaching what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. <q>Thus,</q> says He, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as in heaven so in earth. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And suffer us not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; but deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053261"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;6:9</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Before all things, the Teacher of peace and the Master of unity would not have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be made singly and individually, as for one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for himself alone. For we say not <q>My Father, which art in heaven,</q> nor <q>Give me this day my daily bread; </q>nor does each one ask that only his own debt should be forgiven him; nor does he request for himself alone that he may not be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is public and common; and when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for one, but for the whole people, because we the whole people are one. The God of peace and the Teacher of concord, who taught unity, willed that one should thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all, even as He Himself bore us all in one.  This law of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the three children observed when they were shut up in the fiery furnace, speaking together in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and being of one heart in the agreement of the spirit; and this the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the sacred Scripture assures us, and in telling us how such as these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, gives an example which we ought to follow in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, in order that we may be such as they were: <q>Then these three,</q> it says, <q>as if from one mouth sang an hymn, and blessed the Lord.</q>  They spoke as if from one mouth, although Christ had not yet taught them how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And therefore, as they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, their speech was availing and effectual, because a peaceful, and sincere, and spiritual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> deserved well of the Lord. Thus also we find that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> after the Lord's ascension: <q>They all,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>continued with one accord in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and Mary who was the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and with His brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053264"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse14">Acts 1:14</a></span> They continued with one accord in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, declaring both by the urgency and by the agreement  of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who makes men to dwell of one mind in a house,</q>  only admits into the divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> home those among whom <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is unanimous.</p>

<p>9. But what matters of deep moment  are contained in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>! How many and! How great, briefly collected in the words, but spiritually abundant in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>! so that there is absolutely nothing passed over that is not comprehended in these our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and petitions, as in a compendium of heavenly doctrine. <q>After this manner,</q> says He, <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: Our Father, which art in heaven.</q> The new man, born again and restored to his God by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, says <q>Father,</q> in the first place because he has now begun to be a son. <q>He came,</q> He says, <q>to His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053268"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse11">John 1:11</a></span> The man, therefore, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His name, and has become God's son, ought from this point to begin both to give thanks and to profess himself God's son, by declaring that God is his Father in heaven; and also to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, among the very first words of his new birth, that he has renounced an earthly and carnal father, and that he has begun to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as well as to have as a father Him only who is in heaven, as it is written: They who say unto their father and their mother, I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> you, and who have not acknowledged their own children these have observed Your precepts and have kept Your covenant.<span class="stiki" id="note053269"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 33:9</a></span> Also the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has bidden us to call <q>no man our father upon earth, because there is to us one Father, who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053270"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew 23:9</a></span> And to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who had made mention of his dead father, He replied, <q>Let the dead bury their dead; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053271"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew 8:22</a></span> for he had said that his father was dead, while the Father of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> is living.</p>

<p>10. Nor ought we, beloved brethren, only to observe and understand that we should call Him <em>Father</em> who is in heaven; but we add to it, and say <em>our</em> Father, that is, the Father of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash; of those who, being sanctified by Him, and restored by the nativity of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, have begun to be sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A word this, moreover, which rebukes and condemns the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who not only unbelievingly despised Christ, who had been announced to them by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and sent first to them, but also cruelly put Him to death; and these cannot now call God their Father, since the Lord confounds and confutes them, saying, <q>You are born of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father you will do. For he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053272"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John 8:44</a></span> And by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> God cries in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <q>I have begotten and brought up children; but they have despised me. The ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, and my people has not understood me. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> seed, corrupt children!  You have forsaken the Lord; you have provoked the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053274"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah 1:3</a></span> In repudiation of these, we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, say Our Father; because He has begun to be ours, and has ceased to be the Father of the jews, who have forsaken Him. Nor can a sinful people be a son; but the name of sons is attributed to those to whom remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted, and to them <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is promised anew, in the words of our Lord Himself: <q>Whosoever commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And the servant abides not in the house for ever, but the son abides ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053275"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a></span></p>

<p>11. But how great is the Lord's indulgence! How great His condescension and plenteousness of goodness towards us, seeing that He has wished us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a way as to call God Father, and to call ourselves sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, -a name which none of us would dare to venture on in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, unless He Himself had allowed us thus to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>! We ought then, beloved brethren, to remember and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that when we call God Father, we ought to act as God's children; so that in the measure in which we find pleasure in considering God as a Father, He might also be able to find pleasure in us. Let us converse as temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it may be plain that God dwells in us. Let not our doings be degenerate from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; so that we who have begun to be heavenly and spiritual, may consider and do nothing but spiritual and heavenly things; since the Lord God Himself has said, <q>Them that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> me I will <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; and he that despises me shall be despised.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053276"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse30">1 Samuel 2:30</a></span> The blessed apostle also has laid down in his epistle: <q>You are not your own; for you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear about God in your body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053277"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 6:20</a></span></p>

<p>12. After this we say, <q>Hallowed be Your name; </q>not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but that we beseech of Him that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God sanctified, since He Himself sanctifies? Well, because He says, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, even as I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053278"><a href="../bible/lev020.htm#verse7">Leviticus 20:7</a></span> we ask and entreat, that we who were sanctified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may continue in that which we have begun to be. And this we daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for; for we have need of daily sanctification, that we who daily fall away may wash out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by continual sanctification. And what the sanctification is which is conferred upon us by the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the apostle declares, when he says, <q>neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor thieves, nor deceivers, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And such indeed were you; but you are washed; but you are justified; but you are sanctified in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by the Spirit of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053279"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 6:9</a></span> He says that we are sanctified in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by the Spirit of our God. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that this sanctification may abide in us and because our Lord and Judge warns the man that was healed and quickened by Him, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more lest a worse thing happen unto him, we make this supplication in our constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we ask this day and night, that the sanctification and quickening which is received from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God may be preserved by His protection.</p>

<p>13. There follows in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, Your kingdom come. We ask that the kingdom of God may be set forth to us, even as we also ask that His name may be sanctified in us. For when does God not reign, or when does that begin with Him which both always has been, and never ceases to be? We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that our kingdom, which has been promised us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may come, which was acquired by the blood and passion of Christ; that we who first are His subjects in the world, may hereafter reign with Christ when He reigns, as He Himself promises and says, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which has been prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053280"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34</a></span> Christ Himself, dearest brethren, however, may be the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, whom we day by day desire to come, whose advent we crave to be quickly manifested to us. For since He is Himself the Resurrection,  since in Him we rise again, so also the kingdom of God may be understood to be Himself, since in Him we shall reign. But we do well in seeking the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, that is, the heavenly kingdom, because there is also an earthly kingdom. But he who has already renounced the world, is moreover greater than its honours and its kingdom. And therefore he who dedicates himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, desires not earthly, but heavenly kingdoms. But there is need of continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication, that we fall not away from the heavenly kingdom, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom this promise had first been given, fell away; even as the Lord sets forth and proves: <q>Many,</q> says He, <q>shall come from the east and from the west, and shall recline with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053282"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew 8:11</a></span> He shows that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were previously children of the kingdom, so long as they continued also to be children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but after the name of Father ceased to be recognised among them, the kingdom also ceased; and therefore we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> begin to call God our Father, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also that God's kingdom may come to us.</p>

<p>14. We add, also, and say, <q>Your will be done, as in heaven so in earth; </q>not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should do what He wills, but that we may be able to do what God wills. For who resists <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that l He may not do what He wills? But since we are hindered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> with our thought and deed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in all things, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done in us; and that it may be done in us we have need of God's good will, that is, of His help and protection, since no one is strong in his own strength, but he is safe by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And further, the Lord, setting forth the infirmity of the humanity which He bore, says, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me' and affording an example to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they should do not their own will, but God's, He went on to say, <q>Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053283"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew 26:39</a></span> And in another place He says, <q>I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053284"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John 6:38</a></span> Now if the Son was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to do His Father's will, how much more should the servant be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to do his Master's will! As in his epistle John also exhorts and instructs us to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the ambition of life, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world. And the world shall pass away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as God also abides for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053285"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1 John 2:15-17</a></span> We who desire to abide for ever should do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is everlasting.</p>

<p>15. Now that is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which Christ both did and taught. Humility in conversation; steadfastness in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; modesty in words; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; mercifulness in works; discipline in morals; to be unable to do a wrong, and to be able to bear a wrong when done; to keep peace with the brethren; to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God with all one's heart; to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him in that He is a Father; to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him in that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to prefer nothing whatever to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because He did not prefer anything to us; to adhere inseparably to His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; to stand by His cross bravely and faithfully; when there is any contest on behalf of His name and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, to exhibit in discourse that constancy wherewith we make confession; in torture, that confidence wherewith we do battle; in death, that patience whereby we are crowned&mdash;this is to desire to be fellow-heirs with Christ; this is to do the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this is to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father.</p>

<p>16. Moreover, we ask that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be done both in heaven and in earth, each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For since we possess the body from the earth and the spirit from heaven, we ourselves are earth and heaven; and in both&mdash; that is, both in body and spirit&mdash; we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done. For between the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> there is a struggle; and there is a daily strife as they disagree one with the other, so that we cannot do those very things that we would, in that the spirit seeks heavenly and divine things, while the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after earthly and temporal things; and therefore we ask  that, by the help and assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, agreement may be made between these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so that while the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is done both in the spirit and in the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is new-born by Him may be preserved. This is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> openly and manifestly declares by his words: <q>The flesh,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: for these are contrary the one to the other; so that you cannot do the things that you would. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adulteries, fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, murders, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, wraths, strife, seditions, dissensions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in times past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But the fruit of the spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, magnanimity, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, gentleness, continence, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053287"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17-22</a></span> And therefore we make it our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in daily, yea, in continual supplications, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerning us should be done both in heaven and in earth; because this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that earthly things should give place to heavenly, and that spiritual and divine things should prevail.</p>

<p>17. And it may be thus understood, beloved brethren, that since the Lord commands and admonishes us even to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us, we should ask, moreover, for those who are still earth, and have not yet begun to be heavenly, that even in respect of these <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> should be done, which Christ accomplished in preserving and renewing humanity. For since the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are not now called by Him earth, but the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth, and the apostle designates the first man as being from the dust of the earth, but the second from heaven, we reasonably, who ought to be like God our Father, who makes His sun to rise upon the good and bad, and sends rain upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, so <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask by the admonition of Christ as to make our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; that as in heaven&mdash; that is, in us by our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been done, so that we might be of heaven; so also in earth  &mdash; that is, in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not  &mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done, that they who as yet are by their first birth of earth, may, being born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, begin to be of heaven.</p>

<p>18. As the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> goes forward, we ask and say, <q>Give us this day our daily bread.</q> And this may be understood both spiritually and literally, because either way of understanding it is rich in divine usefulness to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For Christ is the bread of life; and this bread does not belong to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but it is ours. And according as we say, <q>Our Father,</q> because He is the Father of those who understand and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; so also we call it <q>our bread,</q> because Christ is the bread of those who are in union with His body.  And we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and daily  receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> for the food of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may not, by the interposition of some heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by being prevented, as withheld and not communicating, from partaking of the heavenly bread, be separated from Christ's body, as He Himself predicts, and warns, <q>I am the bread of life which came down from heaven. If any man eat of my bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053292"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse58">John 6:58</a></span> When, therefore, He says, that whoever shall eat of His bread shall live for ever; as it is manifest that those who partake of His body and receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> by the right of communion are living, so, on the other hand, we must <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> lest any one who, being withheld from communion, is separate from Christ's body should remain at a distance from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; as He Himself threatens, and says, <q>Unless you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and drink His blood, you shall have no life in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053293"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse53">John 6:53</a></span> And therefore we ask that our bread&mdash; that is, Christ&mdash; may be given to us daily, that we who abide and live in Christ may not depart from His sanctification and body. </p>

<p>19. But it may also be thus understood, that we who have renounced the world, and have cast away its riches and pomps in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, should only ask for ourselves food and support, since the Lord instructs us, and says, <q>Whosoever forsakes not all that he has, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053295"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse33">Luke 14:33</a></span> But he who has begun to be Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, renouncing all things according to the word of his Master, ought to ask for his daily food, and not to extend the desires of his petition to a long period, as the Lord again prescribes, and says, <q>Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow itself shall take thought for itself. Sufficient for the day is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053296"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a></span> With reason, then, does Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> ask food for himself for the day, since he is prohibited from thinking of the morrow; because it becomes a contradiction and a repugnant thing for us to seek to live long in this world, since we ask that the kingdom of God should come quickly. Thus also the blessed apostle admonishes us, giving substance and strength to the steadfastness of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <q>We brought nothing,</q> says he, <q>into this world, nor indeed can we carry anything out. Having therefore food and raiment, let us be herewith content. But they that will be rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and a snare, and into many and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which drown men in perdition and destruction. For the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; which while some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> after, they have made shipwreck from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053297"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse7">1 Timothy 6:7</a></span></p>

<p>20. He teaches us that riches are not only to be contemned, but that they are also full of peril; that in them is the root of seducing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that deceive the blindness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind by a hidden deception. Whence also God rebukes the rich fool, who thinks of his earthly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and boasts himself in the abundance of his overflowing harvests, saying, <q>You fool, this night your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be required of you; then whose shall those things be which you have provided? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053298"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse20">Luke 12:20</a></span> The fool who was to die that very night was rejoicing in his stores, and he to whom life already was failing, was thinking of the abundance of his food. But, on the other hand, the Lord tells us that he becomes perfect and complete who sells all his goods, and distributes them for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and so lays up for himself treasure in heaven. He says that that man is able to follow Him, and to imitate the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord's passion, who, free from hindrance, and with his loins girded, is involved in no entanglements of worldly estate, but, at large and free himself, accompanies his possessions, which before have been sent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For which result, that every one of us may be able to prepare himself, let him thus learn to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, from the character of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, what he ought to be.</p>

<p>21. For daily bread cannot be wanting to the righteous man, since it is written, The Lord will not slay the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the righteous by hunger;  <span class="stiki" id="note053299"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse3">Proverbs 10:3</a></span> and again I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.  And the Lord moreover promises and says, Take no thought, saying, <q>What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the nations seek. And your Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that you have need of all these things. Seek first the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053301"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse31">Matthew 6:31</a></span> To those who seek God's kingdom and righteousness, He promises that all things shall be added.  For since all things are God's, nothing will be wanting to him who possesses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if God Himself be not wanting to him. Thus a meal was divinely provided for Daniel: when he was shut up by the king's command in the den of lions, and in the midst of wild beasts who were hungry, and yet spared him, the man of God was fed. Thus Elijah in his flight was nourished both by ravens ministering to him in his solitude, and by birds bringing him food in his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. And&mdash; oh detestable cruelty of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of man!&mdash; the wild beasts spare, the birds feed, while men lay snares, and rage!</p>

<p>22. After this we also entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, saying, <q>And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</q> After the supply of food, pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is also asked for, that he who is fed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may live in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that not only the present and temporal life may be provided for, but the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> also, to which we may come if our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven; and these the Lord calls debts, as He says in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053303"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse32">Matthew 18:32</a></span> And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and while pardon is asked for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> recalls its own consciousness <em>of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>! Lest any one should flatter himself that he is innocent,  and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us; but if we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the Lord is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  In his epistle he has combined both, that we should entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and that we should obtain pardon when we ask. Therefore he said that the Lord was faithful to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, keeping the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His promise; because He who taught us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our debts and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has promised that His fatherly mercy and pardon shall follow.</p>

<p>23. He has clearly joined herewith and added the law, and has bound us by a certain condition and engagement, that we should ask that our debts be forgiven us in such a manner as we ourselves forgive our debtors, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that that which we seek for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be obtained unless we ourselves have acted in a similar way in respect of our debtors. Therefore also He says in another place, <q>With what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</q>  And the servant who, after having had all his debt forgiven him by his master, would not forgive his fellow-servant, is cast back into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; because he would not forgive his fellow-servant, he lost the indulgence that had been shown to himself by his lord. And these things Christ still more urgently sets forth in His precepts with yet greater power of His rebuke. <q>When you stand <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>,</q> says He, <q>forgive if you have anything against any, that your Father which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses.</q>  There remains no ground of excuse in the day of judgment, when you will be judged according to your own sentence; and whatever you have done, that you also will suffer. For God commands us to be peacemakers, and in agreement, and of one mind in His house;  and such as He makes us by a second birth, such He wishes us when new-born to continue, that we who have begun to be sons of God may abide in God's peace, and that, having one spirit, we should also have one heart and one mind. Thus God does not receive the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a person who is in disagreement, but commands him to go back from the altar and first be reconciled to his brother, that so God also may be appeased by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a peace-maker. Our peace and brotherly agreement  is the greater <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;and a people united in one in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>24. For even in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which Abel and Cain first offered, God looked not at their gifts, but at their hearts, so that he was acceptable in his gift who was acceptable in his heart. Abel, peaceable and righteous in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> in innocence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, taught others also, when they bring their gift to the altar, thus to come with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with a simple heart, with the law of righteousness, with the peace of concord. With reason did he, who was such in respect of God's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, become subsequently himself a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that he who first set forth <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and initiated the Lord's passion by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his blood, had both the Lord's righteousness and His peace. Finally, such are crowned by the Lord, such will be avenged  with the Lord in the day of judgment; but the quarrelsome and disunited, and he who has not peace with his brethren, in accordance with what the blessed apostle and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> testifies, even if he have been slain for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, shall not be able to escape the crime of fraternal dissension, because, as it is written, He who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer  <span class="stiki" id="note053311"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1 John 3:15</a></span> and no murderer attains to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, nor does he live with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He cannot be with Christ, who had rather be an imitator of Judas than of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How great is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which cannot even be washed away by a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of blood&mdash; how heinous the crime which cannot be expiated by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>!</p>

<p>25. Moreover, the Lord of necessity admonishes us to say in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>And suffer us not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> In which words it is shown that the adversary can do nothing against us except God shall have previously permitted it; so that all our <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and devotion, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> may be turned towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since in our <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> nothing is permitted to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unless power is given from Him. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, which says, <q><a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> came to Jerusalem, and besieged it; and the Lord delivered it into his hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053312"><a href="../bible/2ki024.htm#verse11">2 Kings 24:11</a></span> But power is given to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against us according to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as it is written, <q>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to those who make a prey of Him? Did not the Lord, against whom they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and would not walk in His ways, nor hear His law? And He has brought upon them the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053313"><a href="../bible/isa013.htm#verse24">Isaiah 13:24</a></span> And again, when Solomon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and departed from the Lord's commandments and ways, it is recorded, <q>And the Lord stirred up <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> against Solomon himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053314"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse14">1 Kings 11:14</a></span></p>

<p>26. Now power is given against us in two modes: either for punishment when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> when we are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, as we see was done with respect to Job; as God Himself sets forth, saying, <q>Behold, all that he has I give unto your hands; but be careful not to touch himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053315"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse12">Job 1:12</a></span> And the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says, in the time of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, <q>You could have no power against me unless it were given you from above.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053316"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John 19:11</a></span> But when we ask that we may not come into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness in that we thus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt himself, lest any should proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself, lest any should take to himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> either of confession or of suffering as his own, when the Lord Himself, teaching humility, said, Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;  <span class="stiki" id="note053317"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse38">Mark 14:38</a></span> so that while a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever is sought for suppliantly with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.</p>

<p>27. After all these things, in the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> comes a brief clause, which shortly and comprehensively sums up all our petitions and our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For we conclude by saying, <q>But deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> comprehending all adverse things which the enemy attempts against us in this world, from which there may be a faithful and sure protection if God deliver us, if He afford His help to us who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for and implore it. And when we say, Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there remains nothing further which ought to be asked. When we have once asked for God's protection against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and have obtained it, then against everything which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the world work against us we stand secure and safe. For what <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is there in this life, to the man whose guardian in this life is God?</p>

<p>28. What wonder is it, beloved brethren, if such is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taught, seeing that He condensed in His teaching all our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in one saving sentence? This had already been before foretold by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when, being filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he spoke of the majesty and loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>consummating and shortening His word,</q>  He says, <q>in righteousness, because a shortened word  will the Lord make in the whole earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053320"><a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse22">Isaiah 10:22</a></span> For when the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, came unto all, and gathering alike the learned and unlearned, published to every sex and every age the precepts of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He made a large compendium of His precepts, that the memory of the scholars might not be burdened in the celestial learning, but might quickly learn what was necessary to a simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thus, when He taught what is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, He embraced the sacrament of life in a large and divine brevity, saying, <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053321"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a></span> Also, when He would gather from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> the first and greatest commandments, He said, <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the Lord your God is one God: and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. And the second is like it, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053322"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew 12:29-31</a></span> <q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053323"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew 22:40</a></span> And again: <q>Whatsoever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things you would have men do to you, do even so to them. For this is the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053324"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse12">Matthew 7:12</a></span></p>

<p>29. Nor was it only in words, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also, that the Lord taught us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, Himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> frequently and beseeching, and thus showing us, by the testimony of His example, what it behooved us to do, as it is written, <q>But Himself departed into a solitary place, and there <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053325"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse16">Luke 5:16</a></span> And again: <q>He went out into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and continued all night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But if He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> who was without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how much more ought sinners to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; and if He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> continually, watching through the whole night in uninterrupted petitions, how much more ought we to watch  nightly in constantly repeated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>!</p>

<p>30. But the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and besought not for Himself&mdash; for why should He who was guiltless <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> on His own behalf?&mdash; but for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as He Himself declared, when He said to Peter, <q>Behold, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired that he might sift you as wheat. But I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you, that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053328"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse31">Luke 13:31</a></span> And subsequently He beseeches the Father for all, saying, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these alone, but for them also which shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word; that they all may be one; as You, Father, art in me, and I in You, that they also may be one in us.</q>  The Lord's loving-kindness, no less than His mercy, is great in respect of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in that, not content to redeem us with His blood, He in addition also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for us. Behold now what was the desire of His petition, that like as the Father and Son are one, so also we should abide in absolute unity; so that from this it may be understood how greatly he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who divides unity and peace, since for this same thing even the Lord besought, desirous doubtless that His people should thus be saved and live in peace, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that discord cannot come into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. </p>

<p>31. Moreover, when we stand <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, beloved brethren, we ought to be watchful and earnest with our whole heart, intent on our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Let all carnal and worldly thoughts pass away, nor let the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at that time think on anything but the object only of its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For this reason also the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by way of preface before his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, prepares the minds of the brethren by saying, <q>Lift up your hearts,</q> that so upon the people's response, <q>We lift them up unto the Lord,</q> he may be reminded that he himself ought to think of nothing but the Lord.  Let the breast be closed against the adversary, and be open to God alone; nor let it suffer God's enemy to approach to it at the time of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For frequently he steals upon us, and penetrates within, and by crafty deceit calls away our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may have one thing in our heart and another in our voice, when not the sound of the voice, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, ought to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the Lord with a simple intention. But what carelessness it is, to be distracted and carried away by foolish and profane thoughts when you are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the Lord, as if there were anything which you should rather be thinking of than that you are speaking with God! How can you ask to be heard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when you yourself do not hear yourself? Do you wish that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should remember you when you ask, if you yourself do not remember yourself? This is absolutely to take no precaution against the enemy; this is, when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to offend the majesty of God by the carelessness of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; this is to be watchful with your eyes, and to be asleep with your heart, while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even though he is asleep with his eyes, ought to be awake with his heart, as it is written in the person of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> speaking in the Song of Songs, I sleep, yet my heart wakes. <span class="stiki" id="note053332"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse2">Song of Songs 5:2</a></span> Wherefore the apostle anxiously and carefully warns us, saying, <q>Continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and watch in the same; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053333"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse2">Colossians 1:2</a></span> teaching, that is, and showing that those are able to obtain from God what they ask, whom God sees to be watchful in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>32. Moreover, those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> should not come to God with fruitless or naked <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Petition is ineffectual when it is a barren entreaty that beseeches God.  For as every tree that brings not forth fruit is cut down and cast into the fire; assuredly also, words that do not bear fruit cannot deserve anything of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are fruitful in no result. And thus <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> instructs us, saying, <q>Prayer is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and almsgiving.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053335"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm">Tobit 12:8</a></span> For He who will give us in the day of judgment a reward for our labours and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, is even in this life a merciful hearer of one who comes to Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> associated with good works. Thus, for instance, Cornelius the centurion, when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, had a claim to be heard. For he was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing many <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> towards the people, and of ever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To this man, when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> about the ninth hour, appeared an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> bearing testimony to his labours, and saying, <q>Cornelius, your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are gone up in remembrance before God.</q> </p>

<p>33. Those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> quickly ascend to God which the merits of our labours urge upon God. Thus also Raphael the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the constant good works of Tobias, saying, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> to reveal and confess the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and Sarah, I did bring the remembrance of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when you buried the dead in simplicity, and because you did not delay to rise up and to leave your dinner, but went out and covered the dead, I was sent to prove you; and again God has sent me to heal you, and Sarah your daughter-in-law. For I am Raphael, one of the seven <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which stand and go in and out before the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053337"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse12">Tobit 12:12-15</a></span> By Isaiah also the Lord reminds us, and teaches similar things, saying, <q>Loosen every knot of iniquity, release the oppressions of contracts which have no power, let the troubled go into peace, and break every <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> engagement. Break your bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are without shelter into your house. When you see the naked, clothe him; and despise not those of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and race as yourself. Then shall your light break forth in season, and your raiment shall spring forth speedily; and righteousness shall go before you, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God shall surround you. Then shall you call, and God shall hear you; and while you shall yet speak, He shall say, Here I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053338"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse6">Isaiah 58:6-9</a></span> He promises that He will be at hand, and says that He will hear and protect those who, loosening the knots of unrighteousness from their heart, and giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> among the members of God's household according to His commands, even in hearing what God commands to be done, do themselves also deserve to be heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when aided in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of affliction by his brethren, said that good works which are performed are <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>I am full,</q> says he. <q>having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> acceptable, well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053339"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse18">Philippians 4:18</a></span> For when one has pity on the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, he lends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he who gives to the least gives to God&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> spiritually to God an odour of a sweet smell.</p>

<p>34. And in discharging the duties of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, we find that the three children with Daniel, being strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and victorious in captivity, observed the third, sixth, and ninth hour, as it were, for a sacrament of the Trinity, which in the last times had to be manifested. For both the first hour in its progress to the third shows forth the consummated number of the Trinity, and also the fourth proceeding to the sixth declares another Trinity; and when from the seventh the ninth is completed, the perfect Trinity is numbered every three hours, which spaces of hours the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time past having spiritually decided on, made use of for determined and lawful times for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And subsequently the thing was manifested, that these things were of old <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, in that anciently righteous men <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in this manner. For upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descended, who fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord's promise. Moreover, at the sixth hour, Peter, going up unto the house-top, was instructed as well by the sign as by the word of God admonishing him to receive all to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whereas he was previously doubtful of the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And from the sixth hour to the ninth, the Lord, being crucified, washed away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by His blood; and that He might redeem and quicken us, He then accomplished His victory by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>.</p>

<p>35. But for us, beloved brethren, besides the hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> observed of old,  both the times and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have now increased in number. For we must also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the morning, that the Lord's resurrection may be celebrated by morning <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And this formerly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> pointed out in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, saying, <q>My King, and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because unto You will I cry; O Lord, in the morning shall You hear my voice; in the morning will I stand before You, and will look up to You.</q>  And again, the Lord speaks by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Early in the morning shall they watch for me, saying, Let us go, and return unto the Lord our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053342"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse1">Hosea 6:1</a></span> Also at the sunsetting and at the decline of day, of necessity we must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> again. For since Christ is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sun and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> day, as the worldly sun and worldly day depart, when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask that light may return to us again, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which shall give us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of everlasting light. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Psalms manifests that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called the day. <q>The stone,</q> says He, <q>which the builders rejected, has become the head of the corner. This is the Lord's doing; and it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord has made; let us walk and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it.</q>  Also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Malachi testifies that He is called the Sun, when he says, <q>But to you that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the name of the Lord shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and there is healing in His wings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053344"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi 4:2</a></span> But if in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sun and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> day is Christ, there is no hour excepted for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> wherein God ought not frequently and always to be worshipped; so that we who are in Christ&mdash; that is, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sun and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Day&mdash; should be instant throughout the entire day in petitions, and should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; and when, by the law of the world, the revolving night, recurring in its alternate changes, succeeds, there can be no harm arising from the darkness of night to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, because the children of light have the day even in the night. For when is he without light who has light in his heart? Or when has not he the sun and the day, whose Sun and Day is Christ?</p>

<p>36. Let not us, then, who are in Christ&mdash; that is, always in the lights cease from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> even during night. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Anna, without intermission <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and watching, persevered in deserving well of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is written in the I <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>She departed not,</q> it says, <q>from the temple, serving with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day.</q>  Let the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> look to this, who! Are not yet enlightened, or the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who have remained in darkness by having forsaken the light. Let us, beloved brethren, who are always in the light of the Lord, who remember and hold fast what by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> received we have begun to be, reckon night for day; let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we always walk in the light, and let us not be hindered by the darkness which we have escaped. Let there be no failure of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the hours of night&mdash; no idle and reckless waste of the occasions of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. New-created and newborn of the Spirit by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us imitate what we shall one day be. Since in the kingdom we shall possess day alone, without intervention of night, let us so watch in the night as if in the daylight. Since we are to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and give thanks to God for ever, let us not cease in this life also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and give thanks. </p>
