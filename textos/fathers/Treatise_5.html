<h1>Treatise 5</h1>

 <p><strong>An Address to Demetrianus.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; Cyprian, in Reply to Demetrianus the Proconsul of Africa, Who Contended that the Wars, and Famine, and Pestilence with Which the World Was Then Plagued Must Be Imputed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> Because They Did Not Worship the Gods; Fairly Urges (Having Argued that All Things are Gradually Deteriorating with the Old Age of the World) that It Was Rather the Heathens Themselves Who Were the Cause of Such Mischiefs, Because They Did Not Worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, And, Moreover, Were Distressing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with Unjust Persecutions.</span> </p>

<p>1. I had frequently, Demetrianus, treated with contempt your railing and noisy clamour with <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> mouth and impious words against the one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thinking it more modest and better, silently to scorn the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a mistaken man, than by speaking to provoke the fury of a senseless one. Neither did I do this without the authority of the divine teaching,  since it is written, Speak not in the ears of a fool, lest when he hear you he should despise the wisdom of your words;  <span class="stiki" id="note053350"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;23:9</a></span> and again, <q>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053351"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;26:4</a></span> And we are, moreover, bidden to keep what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> within our own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not expose it to be trodden down by swine and dogs, since the Lord speaks, saying, <q>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053352"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> For when you used often to come to me with the desire of contradicting rather than with the wish to learn, and preferred impudently to insist on your own views, which you shouted with noisy words, to patiently listening to mine, it seethed to me foolish to contend with you; since it would he an easier and slighter thing to restrain the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> waves of a turbulent sea with shouts, than to check your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> by arguments. Assuredly it would be both a vain and ineffectual labour to offer light to a blind man, discourse to a deaf one, or wisdom to a brute; since neither can a brute apprehend, nor can a blind man admit the light, nor can a deaf man hear.</p>

<p>2. In consideration of this, I have frequently held my tongue, and overcome an impatient man with patience; since I could neither teach an unteachable man, nor check an impious one with religion, nor restrain a frantic man with gentleness. But yet, when you say that very many are complaining that to us it is ascribed that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> arise more frequently, that plague, that famines rage, and that long droughts are suspending the showers and rains, it is not fitting that I should be silent any longer, lest my silence should begin to be attributed to mistrust rather than to modesty; and while I am treating the false charges with contempt, I may seem to be acknowledging the crime. I reply, therefore, as well to you, Demetrianus, as to others whom perhaps you have stirred up, and many of whom, by sowing <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against us with malicious words. you have made your own partisans, from the budding forth of your own root and origin, who, however, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, will admit the reasonableness of my discourse; for he who is moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the deception of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, will much more easily be moved to good by the cogency of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>3. You have said that all these things are caused by us, and that to us ought to be attributed the misfortunes wherewith the world is now shaken and distressed, because your gods are not worshipped by us. And in this behalf, since you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and a stranger to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you must in the first place <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that the world has now grown old, and does not abide in that strength in which it formerly stood; nor has it that vigour and force which it formerly possessed. This, even were we silent, and if we alleged no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the sacred Scriptures and from the divine declarations, the world itself is now announcing, and, bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to its decline by the testimony of its failing estate.  In the winter there is not such an abundance of showers for nourishing the seeds; in the summer the sun has not so much heat for cherishing the harvest; nor in the spring season are the grain-fields so joyous; nor are the autumnal seasons so fruitful in their leafy products. The layers of marble are dug out in less quantity from the disembowelled and wearied mountains; the diminished quantities of gold and silver suggest the early exhaustion of the metals, and the impoverished veins are straitened and decreased day by day; the husbandman is failing in the fields, the sailor at sea, the soldier in the camp, innocence in the market, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in the tribunal, concord in friendships, skilfulness in the arts, discipline in morals. Think you that the substantial character of a thing that is growing old remains so robust as that wherewith it might previously flourish in its youth while still new and vigorous? Whatever is tending downwards to decay, with its end nearly approaching, must of necessity be weakened. Thus, the sun at his setting darts his rays with a less bright and fiery splendour; thus, in her declining course, the moon wanes with exhausted horns; and the tree, which before had been green and fertile, as its branches dry up, becomes by and by misshapen in a barren old age; and the fountain which once gushed forth liberally from its overflowing veins, as old age causes it to fail, scarcely trickles with a sparing moisture. This is the sentence passed on the world, this is God's law; that everything that has had a beginning should perish, and things that have grown should become old, and that strong things should become weak, and great things become small, and that, when they have become weakened and diminished, they should come to an end.</p>

<p>4. You impute it to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that everything is decaying as the world grows old. What if old men should charge it on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that they grow less strong in their old age; that they no longer, as formerly, have the same facilities, in the hearing of their ears, in the swiftness of their feet, in the keenness of their eyes, in the vigour of their strength, in the freshness of their organic powers, in the fullness of their limbs, and that although once the life of men endured beyond the age of eight and nine hundred years, it can now scarcely attain to its hundredth year? We see grey hairs in boys&mdash; the hair fails before it begins to grow; and life does not cease in old age, but it begins with old age. Thus, even at its very commencement, birth hastens to its close; <span class="stiki" id="note053354"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse13">Wisdom&nbsp;5:13</a></span> thus, whatever is now born degenerates with the old age of the world itself; so that no one ought to wonder that everything begins to fail in the world, when the whole world itself is already in process of failing, and in its end.</p>

<p>5. Moreover, that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> continue frequently to prevail, that death and famine accumulate anxiety, that health is shattered by raging diseases, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is wasted by the desolation of pestilence, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this was foretold; that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> should be multiplied in the last times, and that misfortunes should be varied; and that as the day of judgment is now drawing near, the censure of an indignant God should be more and more aroused for the scourging of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For these things happen not, as your false complaining and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> inexperience of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> asserts and repeats, because your gods are not worshipped by us, but because God is not worshipped by you. For since He is Lord and Ruler of the world, and all things are carried on by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and direction, nor can anything be done save what He Himself has done or allowed to be done, certainly when those things occur which show the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of an offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they happen not on account of us by whom God is worshipped, but they are called down by your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and deservings, by whom God is neither in any way sought nor feared, because your vain <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> are not forsaken, nor the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in such wise that He who is the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> over all might alone be worshipped and petitioned.</p>

<p>6. In fine, listen to Himself speaking; Himself with a divine voice at once instructing and warning us: <q>You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says He, <q>and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053355"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:13</a></span> And again, <q>You shall have none other gods but me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053356"><a href="../bible/exo029.htm#verse3">Exodus 29:3</a></span> And again, <q>Go not after other gods, to serve them; and worship them not, and provoke not me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with the works of your hands to destroy you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053357"><a href="../bible/jer025.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 25:6</a></span> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, attests and denounces the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>Thus says the Lord Almighty: Because of mine house that is waste, and you run every man to his own house, therefore the heavens shall be stayed from dew, and the earth shall withhold her fruits: and I will bring a sword upon the earth, and upon the grain, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labours of their hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053358"><a href="../bible/hag001.htm#verse9">Haggai 1:9</a></span> Moreover, another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> repeats, and says, <q>And I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to rain upon one city, and upon another city I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it not to rain. One piece shall be rained upon, and the piece whereon I send no rain shall be withered. And two and three cities shall be gathered into one city to drink water, and shall not be satisfied; and you are not converted unto me, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053359"><a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse7">Amos 4:7</a></span></p>

<p>7. Behold, the Lord is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and wrathful, and threatens, because you turn not unto Him. And you wonder or complain in this your obstinacy and contempt, if the rain comes down with unusual scarcity; and the earth falls into neglect with dusty corruption; if the barren glebe hardly brings forth a few jejune and pallid blades of grass; if the destroying hail weakens the vines; if the overwhelming whirlwind roots out the olive; if drought stanches the fountain; a pestilent breeze corrupts the air; the weakness of disease wastes away man; although all these things come as the consequence of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that provoke them, and God is more deeply indignant when such and so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> avail nothing! For that these things occur either for the discipline of the obstinate or for the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the same God declares in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, saying, <q>In vain have I smitten your children; they have not received correction.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> devoted and dedicated to God answers to these words in the same strain, and says, <q>You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have scourged them, but they have refused to receive correction.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053361"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 5:3</a></span> Lo, stripes are inflicted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lo, blows and scourgings from above are not wanting, and there is no trembling, no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. What if even no such rebuke as that interfered in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs? How much greater still would be the audacity in men, if it were secure in the impunity of their crimes!</p>

<p>8. You complain that the fountains are now less plentiful to you, and the breezes less salubrious, and the frequent showers and the fertile earth afford you less ready assistance; that the elements no longer subserve your uses and your pleasures as of old. But do you serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all things are ordained to your service; do you wait upon Him by whose good pleasure all things wait upon you?  From your slave you yourself require service; and though a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, you compel your fellow-man to submit, and to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to you; and although you share the same lot in respect of being born, the same condition in respect of dying; although you have like bodily substance and a common order of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and although you come into this world of ours and depart from it after a time with equal rights,  and by the same law; yet, unless you are served by him according to your pleasure, unless you are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by him in conformity to your will, you, as an imperious and excessive exactor of his service, flog and scourge him: you afflict and torture him with hunger, with thirst and nakedness, and even frequently with the sword and with imprisonment. And, wretch that you are, do you not acknowledge the Lord your God while you yourself are thus exercising lordship? </p>

<p>9. And therefore with reason in these plagues that occur, there are not wanting God's stripes and scourges; and since they are of no avail in this matter, and do not convert individuals to God by such terror of destructions, there remains after all the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> dungeon, and the continual fire, and the everlasting punishment; nor shall the groaning of the suppliants be heard there, because here the terror of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> God was not heard, crying by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and saying, <q>Hear the word of the Lord, you children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for the judgment of the Lord is against the inhabitants of the earth; because there is neither mercy, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God upon the earth. But cursing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is broken out over the land, they mingle blood with blood. Therefore shall the land mourn, with every one that dwells therein, with the beasts of the field, with things that creep on the earth, and with the fowls of heaven; and the fishes of the sea shall languish, so that no man shall judge, no man shall rebuke.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053365"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse1">Hosea 4:1-4</a></span> God says He is wrathful and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because there is no acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the earth, and God is neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nor feared. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of lying, of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, of fraud, of cruelty, of impiety, of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, God rebukes and finds fault with, and no one is converted to innocency. Lo, those things are happening which were before foretold by the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor is any one admonished by the belief of things present to take thought for what is to come. Amongst those very misfortunes wherein the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, closely bound and shut up, can scarcely breathe, there is still found opportunity for men to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and in such great dangers to judge not so much of themselves as of others. You are indignant that God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, as if by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life you were deserving any good, as if all things of that kind which happen were not infinitely less and of smaller account than your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>10. You who judge others, be for once also a judge of yourself; look into the hiding-places of your own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; nay, since now there is not even any shame in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,  and you are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as if it were rather the very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> itself that pleased you, do you, who are seen clearly and nakedly by all other men, yourself also look upon yourself. For either you are swollen with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or greedy with <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, or cruel with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or prodigal with gambling, or flushed with intemperance, or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> with jealousy, or unchaste with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or violent with cruelty; and do you wonder that God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> increases in punishing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is punished is daily increasing? You complain that the enemy rises up, as if, though an enemy were wanting, there could be peace for you even among the very togas of peace. You complain that the enemy rises up, as if, even although external arms and dangers from barbarians were repressed, the weapons of domestic assault from the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and wrongs of powerful citizens, would not be more ferocious and more harshly wielded within. You complain of barrenness and famine, as if drought made a greater famine than rapacity, as if the fierceness of want did not increase more terribly from grasping at the increase of the year's produce, and the accumulation of their price. You complain that the heaven is shut up from showers, although in the same way the barns are shut up on earth. You complain that now less is produced, as if what had already been produced were given to the indigent. You reproach plague and disease, while by plague itself and disease the crimes of individuals are either detected or increased, while mercy is not manifested to the weak, and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and rapine are waiting open-mouthed for the dead. The same men are timid in the duties of affection, but rash in quest of implores gains; shunning the deaths of the dying, and craving the spoils of the dead, so that it may appear as if the wretched are probably forsaken in their sickness for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that they may not, by being cured, escape: for he who enters so eagerly upon the estate of the dying, <em>probably</em> desired the sick man to perish.</p>

<p>11. So great a terror of destruction cannot give the teaching of innocency; and in the midst of a people dying with constant havoc, nobody considers that he himself is mortal. Everywhere there is scattering, there is seizure, there is taking possession; no dissimulation about spoiling, and no delay.  As if it were all lawful, as if it were all becoming, as if he who does not rob were suffering loss and wasting his own property, thus every one hastens to the rapine. Among thieves there is at any rate some modesty in their crimes. They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> pathless ravines and deserted solitudes; and they do wrong in such a way, that still the crime of the wrong-doers is veiled by darkness and night. Avarice, <em>however</em>, rages openly, and, safe by its very boldness, exposes the weapons of its headlong craving in the light of the market-place. Thence cheats, thence poisoners, thence assassins in the midst of the city, are as eager for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> as they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with impunity. The crime is committed by the guilty, and the guiltless who can avenge it is not found. There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from accuser or judge: the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> obtain impunity, while modest men are silent; accomplices are afraid, and those who are to judge are for sale. And therefore by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter is put forth with the divine spirit and instinct: it is shown in a certain and obvious way that God can prevent adverse things, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deserts of sinners prevent His bringing aid. <q>Is the Lord's hand,</q> says he, <q>not strong to save you; or has He made heavy His ear, that He cannot hear you? But your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> separate between you and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and because of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He has hid His face from you, that He may not have mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053368"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse1">Isaiah 59:1</a></span> Therefore let your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and of-fences be reckoned up; let the wounds of your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> be considered; and let each one cease complaining about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or about us, if he should perceive that himself deserves what he suffers.</p>

<p>12. Look what that very matter is of which is chiefly our discourse&mdash; that you molest us, although innocent; that, in contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you attack and oppress God's servants. It is little, <em>in your account</em>, that your life is stained with a variety of gross <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, with the iniquity of deadly crimes, with the summary of all bloody rapines; that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is overturned by false <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>; that God is neither sought at all, nor feared at all; but over and above this, you weary  God's servants, and those who are dedicated to His majesty and His name, with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. It is not enough that you yourself do not worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, over and above, you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> those who do worship, with a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> hostility. You neither worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor do you at all permit Him to be worshipped; and while others who venerate not only those foolish <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and images made by man's hands, but even portents and monsters besides, are pleasing to you, it is only the worshipper of God who is displeasing to you. The ashes of victims and the piles of cattle everywhere smoke in your temples, and God's altars are either nowhere or are hidden. Crocodiles, and apes, and stones, and serpents are worshipped by you; and God alone in the earth is not worshipped. or if worshipped, not with impunity. You deprive the innocent, the just, the dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of their home; you spoil them of their estate, you load them with chains, you shut them up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, you punish them with the sword, with the wild beasts, with the flames. Nor, indeed, are you content with a brief endurance of our sufferings, and with a simple and swift exhaustion of pains. You set on foot tedious tortures, by tearing our bodies; you multiply numerous punishments, by lacerating our vitals; nor can your brutality and fierceness be content with ordinary tortures; your ingenious cruelty devises new sufferings.</p>

<p>13. What is this insatiable <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> for blood-shedding, what this interminable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of cruelty? Rather make your election of one of two alternatives. To be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is either a crime, or it is not. If it be a crime, why do you not put the man that confesses it to death? If it be not a crime, why do you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> an innocent man? For I ought to be put to the torture if I denied it. If in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of your punishment I should conceal, by a deceitful <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, what I had previously been, and the fact that had not worshipped your gods, then I might deserve to be tormented, then I ought to be compelled to confession of my crime by the power of suffering, as in other examinations the guilty, who deny that they are guilty of the crime of which they are accused, are tortured in order that the confession of the reality of the crime, which the tell-tale voice refuses to make, may be wrung out by the bodily suffering. But now, when of my own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> I confess, and cry out, and with words frequent and repeated to the same effect bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, why do you apply tortures to one who avows it, and who destroys your gods, not in hidden and secret places, but openly, and publicly, and in the very market-place, in the hearing of your magistrates and governors; so that, although it was a slight thing which you blamed in me before, that which you ought rather to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and punish has increased, that by declaring myself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in a frequented place, and with the people standing around, I am confounding both you and your gods by an open and public announcement?</p>

<p>14. Why do you turn your attention to the weakness of our body? Why do you strive with the feebleness of this earthly flesh? Contend rather with the strength of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, break down the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, destroy our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, conquer if you can by discussion, overcome by reason; or, if your gods have any deity and power, let them themselves rise to their own vindication, let them defend themselves by their own majesty. But what can they advantage their worshippers, if they cannot avenge themselves on those who worship them not? For if he who avenges is of more account than he who is avenged, then you are greater than your gods. And if you are greater than those whom you worship, you ought not to worship them, but rather to be worshipped and feared by them as their lord. Your championship defends them when injured, just as your protection guards them when shut up from perishing. You should be ashamed to worship those whom you yourself defend; you should be ashamed to hope for protection from those whom you yourself protect.</p>

<p>15. Oh, would you but hear and see them when they are adjured by us, and tortured with spiritual scourges, and are ejected from the possessed bodies with tortures of words,  when howling and groaning at the voice of man and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, feeling the stripes and blows, they confess the judgment to come! Come and acknowledge that what we say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and since you say that you thus worship gods, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> even those whom you worship. Or if you will even <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> yourself, he&mdash; i.e., the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>&mdash; who has now possessed your breast, who has now darkened your mind with the night of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, shall speak concerning yourself in your hearing. You will see that we are entreated by those whom you entreat, that we are feared by those whom you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, whom you adore. You will see that under our hands they stand bound, and tremble as captives, whom you took up to and venerate as lords: assuredly even thus you might be confounded in those <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of yours, when you see and hear your gods, at once upon our interrogation betraying what they are, and even in your presence unable to conceal those deceits and trickeries of theirs.</p>

<p>16. What, then, is that sluggishness of mind; yea, what blind and stupid <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of fools, to be unwilling to come out of darkness into light, and to be unwilling, when bound in the toils of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, to receive the hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God when He threatens and says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any gods, but unto the Lord only, shall be rooted out? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053371"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a></span> And again: <q>They worshipped them whom their fingers made; and the mean man has bowed down, and the great man has humbled himself, and I will not forgive them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053372"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse8">Isaiah 2:8</a></span> Why do you <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and bend yourself to false gods? Why do you bow your body captive before foolish images and creations of earth? God made you upright; and while other animals are downlooking, and are depressed in posture bending towards the earth, yours is a lofty attitude; and your countenance is raised upwards to heaven, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Look there, lift your eyes thitherward, seek God in the highest, that you may be free from things below; lift your heart to a dependence on high and heavenly things. Why do you prostrate yourself into the ruin of death with the serpent whom you worship? Why do you fall into the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by his means and in his company? Keep the lofty estate in which you were born. Continue such as you were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To the posture of your countenance and of your body, conform your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. That you may be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself. Forsake the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has invented. Be turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom if you implore He will aid you. Believe in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom  the Father has sent to quicken and restore us. Cease to hurt the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of Christ with your <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, since when they are injured the divine vengeance defends them.</p>

<p>17. For this reason it is that none of us, when he is apprehended, makes resistance, nor avenges himself against your unrighteous <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, although our people are numerous and plentiful. Our certainty of a vengeance to follow makes us patient. The innocent give place to the guilty; the harmless acquiesce in punishments and tortures, sure and confident that whatsoever we suffer will not remain unavenged, and that in proportion to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of I our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> so will be the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the severity of the vengeance exacted for those <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the impious ever rise up against the name we bear, without immediate vengeance from above attending it. To say nothing of the memories of ancient times, and not to recur with wordy commemoration to frequently repeated vengeance on behalf of God's worshippers, the instance of a recent matter is sufficient to prove that our defence, so speedily, and in its speed so powerfully, followed of late in the ruins of things,  in the destruction of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, in the waste of soldiers, and the diminution of forts. Nor let any one think that this occurred by chance, or think that it was fortuitous, since long ago Scripture has laid down, and said. <q>Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053375"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans 12:19</a></span> And again the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> forewarns, and says, <q>Say not, I will avenge myself of mine enemy, but wait on the Lord, that He may be your help.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053376"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse22">Proverbs 20:22</a></span> Whence it is plain and manifest, that not by our means, but for our sakes, all those things are happening which come down from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>18. Nor let anybody think that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not avenged by those things that are happening, for the reason that they also themselves seem to be affected by their visitation. A man feels the punishment of worldly adversity, when all his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are in the world. He grieves and groans if it is ill with him in this life, with whom it cannot be well after this life, all the fruit of whose life is received here, all whose consolation is ended here, whose fading and brief life here reckons some sweetness and pleasure, but when it has departed hence, there remains for him only punishment added to sorrow. But they have no suffering from the assault of present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> who have confidence in future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. In fact, we are never prostrated by adversity, nor are we broken down, nor do we grieve or murmur in any external misfortune or weakness of body: living by the Spirit rather than by the flesh, we overcome bodily weakness by mental strength. By those very things which torment and weary us, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and trust that we are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and strengthened. </p>

<p>19. Do you think that we suffer adversity equally with yourselves, when you see that the same adverse things are not borne equally by us and by you? Among you there is always a clamorous and complaining impatience; with us there is a strong and religious patience, always quiet and always grateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor does it claim for itself anything joyous or prosperous in this world, but, meek and gentle and stable against all the gusts of this tossing world, it waits for the time of the divine promise; for as long as this body endures, it must needs have a common lot with others, and its bodily condition must be common. Nor is it given to any of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to be separated one from another, except by withdrawal from this present life. In the meantime, we are all, good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, contained in one household. Whatever happens within the house, we suffer with equal <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, until, when the end of the temporal life shall be attained, we shall be distributed among the homes either of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death or <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Thus, therefore, we are not on the same level, and equal with you, because, placed in this present world and in this flesh, we incur equally with you the annoyances of the world and of the flesh; for since in the sense of pain is all punishment, it is manifest that he is not a sharer of your punishment who, you see, does not suffer pain equally with yourselves. </p>

<p>20. There flourishes with us the strength of hope and the firmness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Among these very ruins of a decaying world our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is lifted up, and our <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> unshaken: our patience is never anything but joyous; and the mind is always secure of its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> speaks through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and exhorts us, strengthening with a heavenly word the firmness of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>The fig-tree,</q> says He, <q>shall not bear fruit, and there shall be no blossom in the vines. The labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat. The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. But I will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and I will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053379"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse17">Habakkuk 3:17</a></span> He says that the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, depending on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his hope, and Corroded on the steadfastness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is not moved by the attacks of this world and this life. Although the vine should fail, and the olive deceive, and the field parched with grass dying with drought should wither, what is this to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? What to God's servants whom paradise is inviting, whom all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and all the abundance of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is waiting for? They always exult in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and are glad in their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and adversities of the world they bravely suffer, because they are looking forward to gifts and prosperities to come: for we who have put off our earthly birth, and are now created and regenerated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and no longer live to the world but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall not receive God's gifts and promises until we arrive at the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And yet we always ask for the repulse of enemies, and for obtaining showers, and either for the removal or the moderating of adversity; and we pour forth our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and, propitiating and appeasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we entreat constantly and urgently, day and night, for your peace and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>21. Let no one, however, flatter himself, because there is for the present to us and to the profane, to God's worshippers and to God's opponents,  by reason of the equality of the flesh and body, a common condition of worldly troubles, in such a way as to think from this, that all those things which happen are not drawn down by you; since by the announcement of God Himself, and by prophetic testimony, it has previously been foretold that upon the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> should come the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> which humanly would hurt us should not be wanting; but, moreover, that vengeance, which should defend with heavenly defence those who were hurt, should attend them.</p>

<p>22. And how great, too, are those things which in the meantime are happening in that respect on our behalf! Something is given for an example, that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of an avenging God may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But the day of judgment is still future which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> denounces, saying, <q>Howl, for the day of the Lord is at hand, and destruction from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come; for, lo, the day of the Lord comes, cruel with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to lay the earth desolate, and to destroy the sinners out of it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053381"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse6">Isaiah 43:6-9</a></span> And again: <q>Behold, the day of the Lord comes, burning as an oven; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble, and the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053382"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse1">Malachi 4:1</a></span> The Lord prophesies that the aliens shall be burnt up and consumed; that is, aliens from the divine race, and the profane, those who are not spiritually new-born, nor made children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For that those only can escape who have been new-born and signed with the sign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, God says in another place, when, sending forth His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the destruction of the world and the death of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, He threatens more terribly in the last time, saying, <q>Go and smite, and let not your eye spare. Have no pity upon old or young, and slay the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and the little ones and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that they may be utterly destroyed. But touch not any man upon whom is written the mark.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053383"><a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse5">Ezekiel 9:5</a></span> Moreover, what this mark is, and in what part of the body it is placed, God sets forth in another place, saying, <q>Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053384"><a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 9:4</a></span> And that the sign pertains to the passion and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that whoever is found in this sign is kept safe and unharmed, is also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by God's testimony, saying, <q>And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses in which you shall be; and I will see the blood, and will protect you, and the plague of diminution shall not be upon you when I smite the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053385"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse13">Exodus 12:13</a></span> What previously preceded by a figure in the slain lamb is fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which followed afterwards. As, then, when <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was smitten, the Jewish people could not escape except by the blood and the sign of the lamb; so also, when the world shall begin to be desolated and smitten, whoever is found in the blood and the sign of Christ alone shall escape. </p>

<p>23. Look, therefore,  while there is time, to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and since now the end of the world is at hand, turn your minds to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor let that powerless and vain dominion in the world over the just and meek delight you, since in the field, even among the cultivated and fruitful grain, the tares and the darnel have dominion. Nor say that ill fortunes happen because your gods are not worshipped by us; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that He who is not acknowledged on account of His benefits may at least be acknowledged through His judgments. Seek the Lord even late; for long ago, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forewarning by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, exhorts and says, <q>Seek the Lord, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053388"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse6">Amos 5:6</a></span> Know God even late; for Christ at His coming admonishes and teaches this, saying, <q>This is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053389"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a></span> Believe Him who deceives not at all. Believe Him who foretold that all these things should come to pass. Believe Him who willgive to all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the reward of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Believe Him who will call down on them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments in the fires of Gehenna.</p>

<p>24. What will then be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? What the punishment of faithlessness? When the day of judgment shall come, what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, what sorrow of unbelievers; that they should have been unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> here, and now that they should be unable to return that they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>! An ever-burning Gehenna will burn up the condemned, and a punishment devouring with living flames; nor will there be any source whence at any time they may have either respite or end to their torments. Souls with their bodies will be reserved in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> tortures for suffering. Thus the man will be for ever seen by us who here gazed upon us for a season; and the short <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those cruel eyes in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> that they made for us will be compensated by a perpetual spectacle, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which says, <q>Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be for a vision to all flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053390"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah 66:24</a></span> Anti again: <q>Then shall the righteous men stand in great constancy before the face of those who have afflicted them, and have taken away their labours. When they see it, they shall be troubled with horrible <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and they, repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit, shall say within themselves, These are they whom we had some time in derision, and a proverb of reproach; we fools counted their life <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and their end to be without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. How are they numbered among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their lot is among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>! Therefore have we erred from the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the light of righteousness has not shined upon us, and the sun rose not on us. We wearied ourselves in the way of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and destruction; we have gone through deserts where there lay no way; but we have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of the Lord. What has <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us, or what good has the boasting of riches done us? All those things are passed away like a shadow.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053391"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse1">Wisdom 5:1-9</a></span> The pain of punishment will then be without the fruit of penitence; weeping will be useless, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ineffectual. Too late they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p>25. Provide, therefore, while you may, for your safety and your life. We offer you the wholesome help of our mind and advice. And because we may not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, and we please God more by rendering no return for wrong, we exhort you while you have the power, while there yet remains to you something of life, to make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to emerge from the abyss of darkling <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>  into the bright light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. We do not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> your comforts, nor do we conceal the divine benefits. We repay kindness for your <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and for the torments and penalties which are inflicted on us, we point out to you the ways of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Believe and live, and do ye who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us in <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with us for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. When you have once departed there, there is no longer any place for repentance, and no possibility of making satisfaction. Here life is either lost or saved; here <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> safety is provided for by the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the fruits of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nor let any one be restrained either by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or by his years from coming to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. To him who still remains in this world no repentance is too late. The approach to God's mercy is open, and the access is easy to those who seek and apprehend the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Do you entreat for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, although it be in the very end of life, and at the setting of the sun of time; and implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in confession and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of acknowledgment of Him, and pardon is granted to the man who confesses, and saving mercy is given from the divine goodness to the believer, and a passage is opened to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> even in death itself. This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> Christ bestows; this gift of His mercy He confers upon us, by overcoming death in the trophy of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, by redeeming the believer with the price of His blood, by reconciling man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by quickening our mortal nature with a heavenly regeneration. If it be possible, let us all follow Him; let us be registered in His sacrament and sign. He opens to us the way of life; He brings us back to paradise; He leads us on to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Made by Him the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with Him we shall ever live; with Him we shall always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, restored by His own blood. We <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> together with Christ, blessed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, always rejoicing with perpetual pleasures in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ever giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For none can be other than always glad and grateful, who, having been once subject to death, has been made secure in the possession of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. </p>
