<h1>Treatise 7</h1>


<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; The Deacon Pontius in a Few Words Unfolds the Burthen of This Treatise in His Life of Cyprian.</span>  <span class="sc">First of All, Having Pointed Out that Afflictions of This Kind Had Been Foretold by Christ, He Tells Them that the Mortality or Plague Was Not to Be Feared, in that It Leads to Immortality, and that Therefore, that Man is Wanting in Faith Who is Not Eager for a Better World. Nor is It Wonderful that the Evils of This Life are Common to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with the Heathens, Since They Have to Suffer More Than Others in the World, and Thence, After the Example of Job and Tobias, There is Need of Patience Without Murmuring. For Unless the Struggle Preceded, the Victory Could Not Ensue; And How Much Soever Diseases are Common to the Virtuous and Vicious, Yet that Death is Not Common to Them, for that the Righteous are Taken to Consolation, While the Unrighteous are Taken to Punishment.</span> </p>

<p>1. Although in very many of you, dearly beloved brethren, there is a steadfast mind and a firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a devoted spirit that is not disturbed at the frequency of this present mortality, but, like a strong and stable rock, rather shatters the turbulent onsets of the world and the raging waves of time, while it is not itself shattered, and is not overcome but tried by these <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; yet because I observe that among the people some, either through weakness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or through decay of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or through the sweetness of this worldly life, or through the softness of their sex, or what is of still greater account, through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are standing less steadily, and are not exerting the divine and unvanquished vigour of their heart, the matter may not be disguised nor kept in silence, but as far as my feeble powers suffice with my full strength, and with a discourse gathered from the Lord's lessons, the slothfulness of a luxurious disposition must be restrained, and he who has begun to be already a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, must be found worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. For he who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, dearest brethren, ought to acknowledge himself as one who, placed in the heavenly camp, already hopes for  divine things, so that we may have no trembling at the storms and whirlwinds of the world, and no disturbance, since the Lord had foretold that these would come. With the exhortation of His fore-seeing word, instructing, and teaching, and preparing, and strengthening the people of His Church for all endurance of things to come, He predicted and said that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and famines, and earthquakes, and pestilences would arise in each place; and lest an unexpected and new dread of mischiefs should shake us, He previously warned us that adversity would increase more and more in the last times. Behold, the very things occur which were spoken; and since those occur which were foretold before, whatever things were promised will also follow; as the Lord Himself promises, saying, <q>But when you see all these things come to pass, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the kingdom of God is at hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053417"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;21:31</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, beloved brethren, is beginning to be at hand; the reward of life, and the rejoicing of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the perpetual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>  and possession lately lost of paradise, are now coming, with the passing away of the world; already heavenly things are taking the place of earthly, and great things of small, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things of things that fade away. What room is there here for anxiety and solicitude? Who, in the midst of these things, is trembling and sad, except he who is without hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? For it is for him to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death who is not willing to go to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is for him to be unwilling to go to Christ who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is about to reign  with Christ.</p>

<p>3. For it is written that the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  If you are just, and live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, why, since you are about to be with Christ, and are secure of the Lord's promise, do you not embrace the assurance that you are called to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you are freed from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Certainly Simeon, that just man, who was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> just, who kept God's commands with a full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when it had been pledged him from heaven that he should not die before he had seen the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and Christ had come an infant into the temple with His mother, acknowledged in spirit that Christ was now born, concerning whom it had before been foretold to him; and when he had seen Him, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he should soon die. Therefore, rejoicing concerning his now approaching death, and secure of his immediate summons, he received the child into his arms, and blessing the Lord, he exclaimed, and said, <q>Now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053421"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29</a></span> assuredly proving and bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that the servants of God then had peace, then free, then tranquil repose, when, withdrawn from these whirlwinds of the world, we attain the harbour of our home and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> security, when having accomplished this death we come to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For that is our  peace, that our faithful tranquillity, that our steadfast, and abiding, and perpetual security.</p>

<p>4. But for the rest, what else in the world than a battle against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is daily carried on, than a struggle against his darts and weapons in constant conflicts? Our warfare is with <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, with immodesty, with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, with ambition; our diligent and toilsome wrestle with carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, with enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and in every quarter invested with the onsets of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, scarcely in each point meets the attack, scarcely resists it. If <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is prostrated, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> springs up. If <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is overcome, ambition takes its place. If ambition is despised, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> exasperates, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> puffs up, wine-bibbing entices, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> breaks concord, jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids; you are compelled to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, which is not lawful.</p>

<p>5. So many <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied, and yet it delights to abide here long among the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> weapons, although it should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of a quicker death; as He Himself instructs us, and says, <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053423"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse20">John 16:20</a></span> Who would not desire to be without sadness? Who would not hasten to attain to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? But when our sadness shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, the Lord Himself again declares, when He says, <q>I will see you again, and your heart shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; and your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> no man shall take from you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053424"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse22">John 16:22</a></span> Since, therefore, to see Christ is to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and we cannot have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unless when we shall see Christ, what blindness of mind or what folly is it to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world's afflictions, and punishments, and tears, and not rather to hasten to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which can never be taken away!</p>

<p>6. But, beloved brethren, this is so, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is lacking, because no one believes that the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promises are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, although He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whose word to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable. If a grave and praiseworthy man should promise you anything, you would assuredly have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the promiser, and would not think that you should be cheated and deceived by him whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be steadfast in his words and his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now God is speaking with you; and do you faithlessly waver in your unbelieving mind? God promises to you, on your departure from this world, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and do you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? This is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God at all; this is to offend Christ, the Teacher  of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of incredulity; this is for one established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the house of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>7. How great is the advantage of going out of the world, Christ Himself, the Teacher of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of our good works, shows to us, who, when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were saddened that He said that He was soon to depart, spoke to them, and said, <q>If you loved me, you would surely <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> because I go to the Father; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053426"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse28">John 16:28</a></span> teaching thereby, and manifesting that when the dear ones whom we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> depart from the world, we should rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> than grieve. Remembering which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in his epistle lays it down, saying, <q>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053427"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse21">Philippians 1:21</a></span> counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the flesh, but taken away from smarting troubles, and freed from the envenomed fangs of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to go at the call of Christ to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>8. But nevertheless it disturbs some that the power of this Disease attacks our people equally with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, as if the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> for this purpose, that he might have the enjoyment of the world and this life free from the contact of ills; and not as one who undergoes all adverse things here and is reserved for future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. It disturbs some that this mortality is common to us with others; and yet what is there in this world which is not common to us with others, so long as this flesh of ours still remains, according to the law of our first birth, common to us with them? So long as we are here in the world, we are associated with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> in fleshly equality,  but are separated in spirit. Therefore until this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal receive <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and the Spirit  lead us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whatsoever are the disadvantages of the flesh are common to us with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Thus, when the earth is barren with an unproductive harvest, famine makes no distinction; thus, when with the invasion of an enemy any city is taken, captivity at once desolates all; and when the serene clouds withhold the rain, the drought is alike to all; and when the jagged rocks rend the ship, the shipwreck is common without exception to all that sail in her; and the disease of the eyes, and the attack of fevers, and the feebleness of all the limbs is common to us with others, so long as this common flesh of ours is borne by us in the world.</p>

<p>9. Moreover, if the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and keep fast under what condition and what law he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he will be aware that he must suffer more than others in the world, since he must struggle more with the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> teaches and forewarns, saying, <q>My son, when you come to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stand in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and prepare your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q>  And again: <q>In pain endure, and in your humility have patience; for gold and silver is tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053431"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse5">Sirach 2:5</a></span></p>

<p>10. Thus Job, after the loss of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, after the death of his children, grievously afflicted, moreover, with sores and worms, was not overcome, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; since in his very struggles and anguish, showing forth the patience of a religious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he says, <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked also I shall go under the earth: the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; as it seemed fit to the Lord, so it has been done. Blessed be the name of the Lord.</q>  And when his wife also urged him, in his impatience at the acuteness of his pain, to speak something against God with a complaining and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> voice, he answered and said, <q> You speak as one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. If we have received good from the hand of the Lord, why shall we not suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? In all these things which befell him, Job <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not with his lips in the sight of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053433"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse8">Job 1:8</a></span> Therefore the Lord God gives him a testimony, saying, <q>Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in all the earth, a man without complaint, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053434"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse10">Job 2:10</a></span> And Tobias, after his excellent works, after the many and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> illustrations of his merciful spirit, having suffered the loss of his sight, fearing and blessing God in his adversity, by his very bodily affliction increased in praise; and even him also his wife tried to pervert, saying, <q>Where are your righteousnesses? Behold what you suffer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053435"><a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse14">Tobit&nbsp;2:14</a></span> But he, steadfast and firm in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and armed by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his religion to all endurance of suffering, yielded not to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of his weak wife in his trouble, but rather deserved better from God by his greater patience; and afterwards Raphael the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> praises him, saying, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> to show forth and to confess the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and Sara your daughter-in-law, I did offer the remembrance of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when you buried the dead in singleness of heart, and because you did not delay to rise up and leave your dinner, and went and buried the dead, I was sent to make <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of you. And God again has sent me to heal you and Sara your daughter-in-law. For I am Raphael, one of the seven <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are present, and go in and out before the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053436"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse11">Tobit 12:11-15</a></span></p>

<p>11. Righteous men have ever possessed this endurance. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> maintained this discipline from the law of the Lord, not to murmur in adversity, but to accept bravely and patiently whatever things happen in the world; since the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in this matter always offended, that they constantly murmured against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Lord God bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the book of Numbers, saying, <q>Let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053437"><a href="../bible/num017.htm#verse10">Numbers 17:10</a></span> We must not murmur in adversity, beloved brethren, but we must bear with patience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> whatever happens, since it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a broken spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God does not despise; </q>  since also in Deuteronomy the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> warns by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. and says, <q>The Lord your God will vex you, and will bring hunger upon you; and it shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in your heart if you have well kept His commandments or no.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053439"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 8:2</a></span> And again: <q>The Lord your God proves you, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053440"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 13:3</a></span></p>

<p>12. Thus <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, that he might please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not shrink even from losing his son, or from doing an act of parricide. You, who cannot endure to lose your son by the law and lot of mortality, what would you do if you were bidden to slay your son? The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God ought to make you prepared for everything, although it should be the loss of private estate, although the constant and cruel harassment of your limbs by agonizing disorders, although the deadly and mournful wrench from wife, from children, from departing dear ones; Let not these things be offenses to you, but battles: nor let them weaken nor break the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but rather show forth his strength in the struggle, since all the injury inflicted by present troubles is to be despised in the assurance of future blessings. Unless the battle has preceded, there cannot be a victory: when there shall have been, in the onset of battle, the victory, then also the crown is given to the victors. For the helmsman  is recognised in the tempest; in the warfare the soldier is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. It is a wanton display when there is no danger. Struggle in adversity is the trial of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  The tree which is deeply founded in its root is not moved by the onset of winds, and the ship which is compacted of solid timbers is beaten by the waves and is not shattered; and when the threshing-floor brings out the grain, the strong and robust grains despise the winds, while the empty chaff is carried away by the blast that falls upon it.</p>

<p>13. Thus, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, after shipwrecks, after scourgings, after many and grievous tortures of the flesh and body, says that he is not grieved, but benefited by his adversity, in order that while he is sorely afflicted he might more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. <q>There was given to me,</q> he says, <q>a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me, that I should not be lifted up: for which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me; and He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053443"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 12:7-9</a></span> When, therefore, weakness and inefficiency and any destruction seize us, then our strength is made perfect; then our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if when tried it shall stand fast, is crowned; as it is written, <q>The furnace tries the vessels of the potter, and the trial of tribulation just men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053444"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse5">Sirach 27:5</a></span> This, in short, is the difference between us and others who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that in misfortune they complain and murmur, while adversity does not call us away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but strengthens us by its suffering.</p>

<p>14. This trial, that now the bowels, relaxed into a constant flux, discharge the bodily strength; that a fire originated in the marrow ferments into wounds of the fauces; that the intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; that the eyes are on fire with the injected blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion of diseased putrefaction; that from the weakness arising by the maiming and loss of the body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing is obstructed, or the sight darkened&mdash;is profitable as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What a grandeur of spirit it is to struggle with all the powers of an unshaken mind against so many onsets of devastation and death! What sublimity, to stand erect amid the desolation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and not to lie prostrate with those who have no hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but rather to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,  and to embrace the benefit of the occasion; that in thus bravely showing forth our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by suffering endured, going forward to Christ by the narrow way that Christ trod, we may receive the reward of His life  and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to His own judgment! Assuredly he may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, who, not being regenerated of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is delivered over to the fires of Gehenna; he may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die who is not enrolled in the cross and passion of Christ; he may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, who from this death shall pass over to a second death; he may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, whom on his departure from this world <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> flame shall torment with never-ending punishments; he may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die who has this advantage in a lengthened delay, that in the meanwhile his groanings and his anguish are being postponed.</p>

<p>15. Many of our people die in this mortality, that is, many of our people are liberated from this world. This mortality, as it is a plague to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so it is a departure to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to God's servants. The fact that, without any difference made between one ant another, the righteous die as well as the unrighteous, is no reason for you to suppose that it is a common death for the good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> alike. The righteous are called to their place of refreshing, the unrighteous are snatched away to punishment; safety is the more speedily given to the faithful, penalty to the unbelieving. We are thoughtless and ungrateful, beloved brethren, for the divine benefits, and do not acknowledge what is conferred upon us. Lo, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> depart in peace, safe with their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not fearing the threats of the coming <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and his corruptions and his brothels. Boys escape the peril of their unstable age, and in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> attain the reward of continence and innocence. Now the delicate matron does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the tortures; for she has escaped by a rapid death the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and the hands and the torments of the executioner. By the dread of the mortality and of the time the lukewarm are inflamed, the slack are nerved up, the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> are stimulated, the deserters are compelled to return, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are constrained to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the ancient congregation of the faithful is called to rest, the new and abundant army is gathered to the battle with a braver vigour, to fight without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death when the battle shall come, because it comes to the warfare in the time of the mortality.</p>

<p>16. And further, beloved brethren, what is it, what a great thing is it, how pertinent, how necessary, that pestilence and plague which seems horrible and deadly, searches out the righteousness of each one, and examines the minds of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, to see whether they who are in health tend the sick; whether relations affectionately <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their kindred; whether masters pity their languishing servants; whether physicians do not forsake the beseeching patients; whether the fierce suppress their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; whether the rapacious can quench the ever insatiable ardour of their raging <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> even by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death; whether the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> bend their neck; whether the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> soften their boldness; whether, when their dear ones perish, the rich, even then bestow anything,  and give, when they are to die without heirs. Even although this mortality conferred nothing else, it has done this benefit to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to God's servants that we begin gladly to desire <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as we learn not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death. These are trainings for us, not deaths: they give the mind the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; by contempt of death they prepare for the crown.</p>

<p>17. But perchance some one may object, and say, <q>It is this, then, that saddens me in the present mortality, that I, who had been prepared for confession, and had devoted myself to the endurance of suffering with my whole heart and with abundant <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, am deprived of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, in that I am anticipated by death.</q> In the first place, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not in your power, but in the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither can you say that you have lost what you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you would deserve to receive. Then, besides, God the searcher of the reins and heart, and the investigator and knower of secret things, sees you, and praises and approves you; and He who sees that your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was ready in you, will give you a reward for your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Had Cain, when he offered his gift to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, already slain his brother? And yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foreseeing the fratricide conceived in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, anticipated its condemnation. As in that case the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought and mischievous intention were foreseen  by a foreseeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also in God's servants, among whom confession is purposed and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> conceived in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the intention dedicated to good is crowned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the judge. It is one thing for the spirit to be wanting for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and another for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to have been wanting for the spirit. Such as the Lord finds you when He calls you, such also He judges you; since He Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and says, <q>And all the churches shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the searcher of the reins and heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053449"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse23">Revelation 2:23</a></span> For God does not ask for our blood, but for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  For neither <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, nor Isaac, nor Jacob were slain; and yet, being honoured by the deserts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness, they deserved to be first among the patriarchs, to whose feast is collected every one that is found faithful, and righteous, and praiseworthy.</p>

<p>18. We ought to remember that we should do not our own will, but God's, in accordance with what our Lord has bidden us daily to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. How preposterous and absurd it is, that while we ask that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be done, yet when God calls and summons us from this world, we should not at once <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the command of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>! We struggle and resist, and after the manner of froward servants we are dragged to the presence of the Lord with sadness and grief, departing hence under the bondage of necessity, not with the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; and we wish to be honoured with heavenly rewards by Him to whom we come unwillingly. Why, then, do we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and ask that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> may come, if the captivity of earth delights us? Why with frequently repeated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> do we entreat and beg that the day of His kingdom may hasten, if our greater desires and stronger wishes are to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> here, rather than to reign with Christ?</p>

<p>19. Besides, that the indications of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> may be more evidently manifest, proving that the Lord, prescient of the future, takes counsel for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of His people, when one of our colleagues and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, wearied out with infirmity, and anxious about the present approach of death, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for a respite to himself; there stood by him as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and when he was now at the point of death, a youth, venerable in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and majesty, lofty in stature and shining in aspect, and on whom, as he stood by him, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> glance could scarcely look with fleshly eyes, except that he who was about to depart from the world could already behold such a one. And he, not without a certain indignation of mind and voice, rebuked him, and said, You <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to suffer, you do not wish to depart; what shall t do to you? It was the word of one rebuking and warning, one who, when men are anxious about <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and indifferent concerning their summons, consents not to their present desire, but consults for the future. Our dying brother and colleague heard what he was to say to others. For he who heard when he was dying, heard for the very purpose that he might tell it; he heard not for himself, but for us. For what could he, who was already on the eve of departure, learn for himself? Yea, doubtless, he learned it for us who remain, in order that, when we find the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who sought for delay rebuked, we might acknowledge what is beneficial for all.</p>

<p>20. To myself also, the very least and last, how often has it been revealed, how frequently and manifestly has it been commanded by the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I should diligently bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and publicly declare that our brethren who are freed from this world by the Lord's summons are not to be lamented, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are not lost, but sent before;  that, departing from us, they precede us as travellers, as navigators are accustomed to do; that they should be desired, but not bewailed; that the black garments should not be taken upon us here,  when they have already taken upon them white raiment there; that occasion should not be given to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for them deservedly and rightly to reprehend us, that we mourn for those, who, we say, are alive with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if they were extinct and lost; and that we do not approve wills the testimony of the heart and breast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we express with speech and word. We are prevaricators of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: what we say appears to be simulated, feigned, counterfeit. There is no advantage in setting forth <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by our words, and destroying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>21. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> reproaches, and rebukes, and blames any who are in sorrow at the departure of their friends. <q>I would not,</q> says he, have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died and rose again, even so them which are asleep in Jesus Will God bring with Him.  He says that those have sorrow in the departure of their friends who have no hope. But we who live in hope, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and trust that Christ suffered for us and rose again, abiding in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and through Him and in Him rising again, why either are we ourselves unwilling to depart hence from this life, or do we bewail and grieve for our friends when they depart as if they were lost, when Christ Himself, our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, encourages us and says, <q>I am the resurrection and the life: he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, though he die, yet shall live; and whosoever lives and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me shall not die <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053454"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse25">John 11:25</a></span> If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His words and promises; and since we shall not die <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, let us come with a glad security unto Christ, with whom we are both to conquer and to reign for ever.</p>

<p>22. That in the meantime we die, we are passing over to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> by death; nor can <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life follow, unless it should befall us to depart from this life. That is not an ending, but a transit, and, this journey of time being traversed, a passage to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Who would not hasten to better things? Who would not crave to be changed and renewed  into the likeness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to arrive more quickly to the dignity of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle announces and says, <q>For our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; who shall change the body of our humiliation, and conform it to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053456"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a></span> Christ the Lord also promises that we shall be such, when, that we may be with Him, and that we may live with Him in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> mansions, and may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in heavenly kingdoms, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> the Father for us, saying, <q>Father, I will that they also whom You have given me be with me where I am, and may see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You have given me before the world was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053457"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John 17:24</a></span> He who is to attain to the throne of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the heavenly kingdoms, ought not to mourn nor lament, but rather, in accordance with the Lord's promise, in accordance with his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in this his departure and translation.</p>

<p>23. Thus, moreover, we find that <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> also was translated, who pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in Genesis the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and says, <q>And <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and afterwards he was not found, because God translated him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053458"><a href="../bible/gen005.htm#verse24">Genesis 5:24</a></span> To have been pleasing in the sight of God was thus to have merited to be translated from this contagion of the world. And moreover, also, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> teaches by Solomon, that they who please God are more early taken hence, and are more quickly set free, lest while they are delaying longer in this world they should be polluted with the contagions of the world. <q>He was taken away,</q> says he, <q>lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should change his understanding. For his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore hasted He to take him away from the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053459"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse11">Wisdom 4:11</a></span> So also in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is devoted to its God in spiritual <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hastens to the Lord, saying, <q>How amiable are your dwellings, O God of hosts! My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> longs, and hastes unto the courts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>24. It is for him to wish to remain long in the world whom the world delights, whom this life, flattering and deceiving, invites by the enticements of earthly pleasure. Again, since the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, why do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you? And why do you not rather follow Christ, who both redeemed you and loves you? John in his epistle cries and says, exhorting that we should not follow carnal desires and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world. <q>Love not the world,</q> says he, <q>neither the things which are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world. And the world shall pass away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof; but he who does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as God abides for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053461"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1 John 2:15</a></span> Rather, beloved brethren, with a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, with a firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with a robust <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, let us be prepared for the whole <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: laying aside the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, let us think on the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which follows. By this let us show ourselves to be what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that we do not grieve over the departure of those dear to us, and that when the day of our summons shall arrive, we come without delay and without resistance to the Lord when He Himself calls us.</p>

<p>25. And this, as it ought always to be done by God's servants, much more ought to be done now&mdash; now that the world is collapsing and is oppressed with the tempests of mischievous ills; in order that we who see that terrible things have begun, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that still more terrible things are imminent, may regard it as the greatest advantage to depart from it as quickly as possible. If in your dwelling the walls were shaking with age, the roofs above you were trembling, and the house, now worn out and wearied, were threatening an immediate destruction to its structure crumbling with age, would you not with all speed depart? If, when you were on a voyage, an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and raging tempest, by the waves violently aroused, foretold the coming shipwreck, would you not quickly seek the harbour? Lo, the world is changing and passing away, and witnesses to its ruin not now by its age, but by the end of things. And do you not give God thanks, do you not congratulate yourself, that by an earlier departure you are taken away, and delivered from the shipwrecks and disasters that are imminent?</p>

<p>26. We should consider, dearly beloved brethren&mdash; we should now and always reflect that we have renounced the world, and are in the meantime living here as guests and strangers. Let us greet the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which snatches us hence, and sets us free from the snares of the world, and restores us to paradise and the  kingdom. Who that has been placed in foreign lands would not hasten to return to his own country? Who that is hastening to return to his friends would not eagerly desire a prosperous gale, that he might the sooner embrace those dear to him? We regard paradise as our country&mdash; we already begin to consider the patriarchs as our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>: why do we not hasten and run, that we may behold our country, that we may greet our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? There a great number of our dear ones is awaiting us, and a dense crowd of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, brothers, children, is longing for us, already assured of their own safety, and still solicitous for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. To attain to their presence and their embrace, what a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> both for them and for us in common! What a pleasure is there in the heavenly kingdom, without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death; and how lofty and perpetual a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of living! There the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> company of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  &mdash; there the host of the rejoicing <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; there the innumerable multitude of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, crowned for the victory of their struggle and passion&mdash; there the triumphant <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who subdued the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh and of the body by the strength of their continency&mdash; there are merciful men rewarded, who by feeding and helping the poor have done the works of righteousness&mdash; who, keeping the Lord's precepts, have transferred their earthly patrimonies to the heavenly treasuries. To these, beloved brethren, let us hasten with an eager desire; let us crave quickly to be with them, and quickly to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. May God behold this our eager desire; may the Lord Christ look upon this purpose of our mind and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, He who will give the larger rewards of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to those whose desires in respect of Himself were greater!</p>
