<h1>Treatise 9</h1>


<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; Cyprian Himself Briefly Sets Forth the Occasion of This Treatise at the Conclusion of His Epistle to Jubaianus as Follows: <q>Charity of Spirit, the Honour of Our College, the Bond of Faith, and Priestly Concord, are Maintained by Us with Patience and Gentleness. For This Reason, Moreover, We Have, with the Best of Our Poor Abilities, by the Permission and Inspiration of the Lord, Written a Pamphlet on the Benefit of Patience, ' Which, for the Sake of Our Mutual Love, We Have Transmitted to You.</q> a.d. 256.</span> </p>

<p>1. As I am about to speak, beloved brethren, of patience, and to declare its advantages and benefits, from what point should I rather begin than this, that I see that even at this time, for your audience of me, patience is needful, as you cannot even discharge this duty of hearing and learning without patience? For wholesome discourse and reasoning are then effectually learned, if what is said be patiently heard. Nor do I find, beloved brethren, among the rest of the ways of heavenly discipline wherein the path of our hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is directed to the attainment of the divine rewards, anything of more advantage, either as more useful for life or more helpful to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, than that we who are labouring in the precepts of the Lord with the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and devotion, should especially, with our whole watchfulness, be careful of patience. </p>

<p>2. Philosophers also profess that they pursue this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but in their case the patience is as false as their wisdom also is. For whence can he be either wise or patient, who has neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the wisdom nor the patience of God? Since He Himself warns us, and says of those who seem to themselves to be wise in this world, <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will reprove the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053531"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;29:14</a></span> Moreover, the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and sent forth for the calling and training of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and instructs us, saying, <q>See that no man despoil you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ, because in Him dwells all the fullness of divinity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053532"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8,&nbsp;10</a></span> And in another place he says: <q>Let no man deceive himself; if any man among you thinks himself to be wise, let him become a fool to this world, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written, I will rebuke the wise in their own craftiness.</q> And again: <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the wise, that they are foolish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053533"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18-20</a></span> Wherefore if the wisdom among them be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the patience also cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For if he is wise  who is lowly and meek&mdash; but we do not see that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are either lowly or meek, but greatly pleasing themselves, and, for the very reason that they please themselves, displeasing God&mdash; it is evident that the patience is not real among them where there is the insolent audacity of an affected liberty, and the immodest boastfulness of an exposed and half-naked bosom.</p>

<p>3. But for us, beloved brethren, who are <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not in words, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and do not put forward our wisdom in our garb, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; who are better acquainted with the consciousness, than with the boast, of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash; who do not speak great things, but live them&mdash;let us, as servants and worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, show, in our spiritual <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, the patience which we learn from heavenly teachings. For we have this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in common with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From Him patience begins; from Him its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and its dignity take their rise. The origin and greatness of patience proceed from God as its author. Man ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the thing which is dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the good which the Divine Majesty loves, it commends. If God is our Lord and Father, let us imitate the patience of our Lord as well as our Father; because it behooves servants to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, no less than it becomes sons not to be degenerate.</p>

<p>4. But what and how great is the patience in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, most patiently enduring the profane temples and the images of earth, and the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> instituted by men, in contempt of His majesty and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, He makes the day to begin and the light of the sun to arise alike upon the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and while He waters the earth with showers, no one is excluded from His benefits, but upon the righteous equally with the unrighteous He bestows His undiscriminating rains. We see that with undistinguishing  equality of patience, at God's behest, the seasons minister to the guilty and the guiltless, the religious and the impious&mdash; those who give thanks and the unthankful; that the elements wait on them; the winds blow, the fountains flow, the abundance of the harvests increases, the fruits of the vineyards ripen,  the trees are loaded with apples, the groves put on their leaves, the meadows their verdure; and while God is provoked with frequent, yea, with continual offenses, He softens His indignation, and in patience waits for the day of retribution, once for all determined; and although He has revenge in His power, He prefers to keep patience for a long while, bearing, that is to say, mercifully, and putting off, so that, if it might be possible, the long protracted mischief may at some time be changed, and man, involved in the contagion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and crimes, may even though late be converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He Himself warns and says, <q>I do not will the death of him that dies, so much as that he may return and live.</q>  And again, Return unto me, says the Lord.  And again: <q>Return to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He is merciful, and gracious, and patient, and of great pity, and who inclines His judgment towards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> inflicted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053539"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse13">Joel 2:13</a></span> Which, moreover, the blessed apostle referring to, and recalling the sinner to repentance, sets forward, and says: <q>Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the patience and goodness of God leads you to repentance? But after your hardness and impenitent heart you store up unto yourself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and of revelation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall render to every one according to his works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053540"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans 2:4-6</a></span> He says that God's judgment is just, because it is tardy, because it is long and greatly, deferred, so that by the long patience of God man may be benefited for life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.  Punishment is then executed on the impious and the sinner, when repentance for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can no longer avail.</p>

<p>5. And that we may more fully understand, beloved brethren, that patience is a thing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that whoever is gentle, and patient, and meek, is an imitator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; when the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was giving precepts for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and, bringing forth divine warnings, was instructing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to perfection, He laid it down, and said, <q>You have heard that it is said, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour, and have your enemy in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them which <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you; that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, who makes His sun to rise on the good and on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rains upon the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. For if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, what reward shall you have? Do not even the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> the same? And if you shall salute your brethren only, what do you do more (than others)? Do not even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> the same thing? Be therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053542"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse43">Matthew 5:43-48</a></span> He said that the children of God would thus become perfect. He showed that they were thus completed, and taught that they were restored by a heavenly birth, if the patience of God our Father dwell in us&mdash; if the divine likeness, which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had lost by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, be manifested and shine in our actions. What a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is it to become like to God! What and how great a felicity, to possess among our <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that which may be placed on the level of divine praises!</p>

<p>6. Nor, beloved brethren, did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our God and Lord, teach this in words only; but He fulfilled it also in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And because He had said that He had come down for this purpose, that He might do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father; among the other marvels of His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby He showed forth the marks of a divine majesty, He also maintained the patience of His Father in the constancy of His endurance. Finally, all His actions, even from His very advent, are characterized by patience as their associate; in that, first of all, coming down from that heavenly sublimity to earthly things, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not scorn to put on the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and although He Himself was not a sinner, to bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others. His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> being in the meantime laid aside, He suffers Himself to become mortal, so that the guiltless may be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the guilty. The Lord is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the servant; and He who is about to bestow remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, does not Himself disdain to wash His body in the layer of regeneration. For forty Clays He <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, by whom others are feasted. He is hungry, and suffers famine, that they who had been in hunger of the word and of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be satisfied with heavenly bread. He wrestles with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempting Him; and, content only to have overcome the enemy, He strives no farther than by words. He ruled over His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not as servants in the power of a master; but, kind and gentle, He loved them with a brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. He deigned even to wash the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet, that since the Lord is such among His servants, He might teach, by His example, what a fellow-servant ought to be among his peers and equals. Nor is it to be wondered at, that among the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>  He showed Himself such, since He could bear Judas even to the last with a long patience&mdash; could take meat with His enemy&mdash; could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the household foe, and not openly point him out, nor refuse the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of the traitor. Moreover, in bearing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, how great equanimity and how great patience, in turning the unbelieving to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by persuasion, in soothing the unthankful by concession, in answering gently to the contradictors, in bearing the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> with clemency, in yielding with humility to the persecutors, in wishing to gather together the slayers of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and those who were always rebellious against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to the very hour of His cross and passion!</p>

<p>7. And moreover, in His very passion and cross, before they had reached the cruelty of death and the effusion of blood, what infamies of reproach were patiently heard, what mockings of contumely were suffered, so that <em>He</em> received  the spittings of insulters, who with His spittle had a little before made eyes for a blind man; and He in whose name the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is now scourged by His servants, Himself suffered scourgings! He was crowned with thorns, who crowns <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> flowers. He was smitten on the face with palms, who gives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> palms to those who overcome. He was despoiled of His earthly garment, who clothes others in the vesture of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. He was fed with gall, who gave heavenly food. He was given to drink of vinegar, who appointed the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. That guiltless, that just One&mdash;nay, He who is innocency itself and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself&mdash;is counted among transgressors, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is oppressed with false witnesses. He who shall judge is judged; and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is led silently to the slaughter. And when at the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, of the Lord the stars are confounded, the elements are disturbed, the earth quakes, night shuts out the day, the sun, that he may not be compelled to look on the crime of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, withdraws both his rays and his eyes, He speaks not, nor is moved, nor declares His majesty even in His very passion itself. Even to the end, all things are borne perseveringly and constantly, in order that in Christ a full and perfect patience may be consummated. </p>

<p>8. And after all these things, He still receives His murderers, if they will be converted and come to Him; and with a saving patience, He who is benignant  to preserve, closes His Church to none. Those adversaries, those <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, those who were always enemies to His name, if they repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if they acknowledge the crime committed, He receives, not only to the pardon of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to the reward of the heavenly kingdom. What can be said more patient, what more merciful? Even he is made alive by Christ's blood who has shed Christ's blood. Such and so great is the patience of Christ; and had it not been such and so great, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would never have possessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as an apostle. </p>

<p>9. But if we also, beloved brethren, are in Christ; if we put Him on, if He is the way of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who follow Christ in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, let us walk by the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the Apostle John instructs us, saying, <q>He who says he abides in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053548"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse6">1 John 2:6</a></span> Peter also, upon whom by the Lord's condescension the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was founded,  lays it down in his epistle, and says, <q>Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow His steps, who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened not, but gave Himself up to him that judged Him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</q> </p>

<p>10. Finally, we find that both patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and all the righteous men who in their preceding likeness wore the figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the praise of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were watchful over nothing more than that they should preserve patience with a strong and steadfast equanimity. Thus Abel, who first initiated and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the origin of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and the passion of the righteous man, makes no resistance nor struggles against his fratricidal  brother, but with lowliness and meekness he is patiently slain. Thus <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, believing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and first of all instituting the root and foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when tried in respect of his son, does not hesitate nor delay, but obeys the commands of God with all the patience of devotion. And Isaac, prefigured as the likeness of the Lord's victim, when he is presented by his father for immolation, is found patient. And Jacob, driven forth by his brother from his country, departs with patience; and afterwards with greater patience, he suppliantly brings him back to concord with peaceful gifts, when he is even more impious and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>. Joseph, sold by his brethren and sent away, not only with patience pardons them, but even bountifully and mercifully bestows gratuitous supplies of grain on them when they come to him. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is frequently contemned by an ungrateful and faithless people, and almost <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; and yet with gentleness and patience he entreats the Lord for those people. But in David, from whom, according to the flesh, the nativity of Christ springs, how great and marvellous and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is the patience, that he often had it in his power to be able to kill king Saul, who was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> him and desiring to slay him; and yet, chose rather to save him when placed in his hand, and delivered up to him, not repaying his enemy in turn, but rather, on the contrary, even avenging him when slain! In fine, so many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were slain, so many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were honoured with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> deaths, who all have attained to the heavenly crowns by the praise of patience. For the crown of sorrows and sufferings cannot be received unless patience in sorrow and suffering precede it.</p>

<p>11. But that it may be more manifestly and fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how useful and necessary patience is, beloved brethren; let the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> be pondered, which even in the beginning of the world and of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, Adam, forgetful of the commandment, and a transgressor of the given law, received. Then we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how patient in this life we ought to be who are born in such a state, that we labour here with afflictions and contests. <q>Because,</q> says He, <q>you have hearkened to the voice of your wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which alone I had charged you that you should not eat, cursed shall be, the ground in all your works: in sorrow and in groaning shall you eat of it all the days of your life. Thorns and thistles shall it give forth to you, and you shall eat the food of the field. In the sweat of your face shall you eat your bread, till you return into the ground from which you were taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you go.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053552"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis 3:17-19</a></span> We are all tied and bound with the chain of this sentence, until, death being expunged, we depart from this life. In sorrow and groaning we must of necessity be all the days of our life: it is necessary that we eat our bread with sweat and labour.</p>

<p>12. Whence every one of us, when he is born and received in the inn of this world, takes his beginning from tears; and, although still unconscious and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of all things, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing else in that very earliest birth except to weep. By a natural foresight, the untrained <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> laments the anxieties and labours of the mortal life, and even in the beginning bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by its wails and groans to the storms of the world which it is entering. For the sweat of the brow and labour is the condition of life so long as it lasts. Nor can there be supplied any consolations to those that sweat and toil other than patience; which consolations, while in this world they are fit and necessary for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are especially so for us who are more shaken by the siege of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who, daily standing in the battlefield, are wearied with the wrestlings of an inveterate and skilful enemy; for us who, besides the various and continual battles of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, must also in the contest of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>  forsake our patrimonies, undergo imprisonment, bear chains, spend our lives, endure the sword, the wild beasts, fires, crucifixions&mdash; in fine, all kinds of torments and penalties, to be endured in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of patience; as the Lord Himself instructs us, and says, <q>These things have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. But in the world you shall have tribulation; yet be confident, for I have overcome the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053554"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> And if we who have renounced the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the world, suffer the tribulations and mischiefs of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the world with more frequency and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, how much more ought we to keep patience, wherewith as our helper and ally, we may bear all mischievous things!</p>

<p>13. It is the wholesome precept of our Lord and Master: <q>He that endures,</q> says He, <q>unto the end, the same shall be saved; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053555"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew 10:22</a></span> and again, <q>If you continue,</q> says He, <q>in my word, you shall be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall make you free.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053556"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse31">John 8:31-32</a></span> We must endure and persevere, beloved brethren, in order that, being admitted to the hope of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and liberty, we may attain to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and liberty itself; for that very fact that we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is the substance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. But that hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may attain to their result, there is need of patience. For we are not following after present <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but future, according to what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle also warns us, and says, <q>We are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he hope for? But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we by patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053557"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans 8:24-25</a></span> Therefore, waiting and patience are needful, that we may fulfil that which we have begun to be, and may receive that which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hope for, according to God's own showing.  Moreover, in another place, the same apostle instructs the righteous and the doers of good works, and them who lay up for themselves treasures in heaven with the increase of the divine <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, that they also should be patient; and teaches them, saying, <q>Therefore, while we have time, let us labour in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but especially to them who are of the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But let us not faint in well-doing, for in its season we shall reap.</q>  He admonishes that no man should impatiently faint in his labour, that none should be either called off or overcome by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and desist in the midst of the praise and in the way of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and the things that are past perish, while those which have begun cease to be perfect; as it is written, <q>The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in whatever clay he shall transgress; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053560"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 33:12</a></span> and again, <q>Hold that which you have, that another take not your crown.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053561"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse11">Revelation 3:11</a></span> Which word exhorts us to persevere with patience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, so that he who strives towards the crown with the praise now near at hand, may be crowned by the continuance of patience.</p>

<p>14. But patience, beloved brethren, not only, keeps watch over what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but it also repels what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In harmony with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and associated with what is heavenly and divine, it struggles with the defence of its strength against the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh and the body, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is assaulted and taken. Let us look briefly into a few things out of many, that from a few the rest also may be understood. Adultery, fraud, manslaughter, are mortal crimes. Let patience be strong and steadfast in the heart; and neither is the sanctified body and temple of God polluted by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, nor is the innocence dedicated to righteousness stained with the contagion of fraud; nor, after the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> carried in it,  is the hand spotted with the sword and blood.</p>

<p>15. Charity is the bond of brotherhood, the foundation of peace, the holdfast and security of unity, which is greater than both hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which excels both good works and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, which will abide with us always, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with God in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Take from it patience; and deprived of it, it does not endure. Take from it the substance of bearing and of enduring, and it continues with no roots nor strength. The apostle, finally, when he would speak of charity, joined to it endurance and patience. <q>Charity,</q> he says, <q>is large-souled; charity is kind; charity envies not, is not puffed up, is not provoked, thinks not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; loves all things, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> all things, hopes all things, bears all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053563"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a></span> Thence he shows that it can tenaciously persevere, because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to endure all things. And in another place: <q>Forbearing one another,</q> he says, <q>in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, using every effort to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053564"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians 4:2-3</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that neither unity nor peace could be kept unless brethren should cherish one another with mutual toleration, and should keep the bond of concord by the intervention of patience.</p>

<p>16. What beyond&mdash;that you should not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> nor curse; that you should not seek again your goods when taken from you; that, when you receive a buffet, you should give your other cheek to the smiter; that you should forgive a brother who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against you, not only seven times, but seventy times seven times,  but, moreover, all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> altogether; that you should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your enemies; that you should offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for your adversaries and persecutors? Can you accomplish these things unless you maintain  the steadfastness of patience and endurance? And this we see done in the case of Stephen, who, when he was slain by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a>, did not ask for vengeance for himself, but for pardon for his murderers, saying, <q>Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053567"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse60">Acts 7:60</a></span> It behooved the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Christ thus to be, who, fore-running the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that should follow him in a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death, was not only the preacher of the Lord's passion, but also the imitator of His most patient gentleness. What shall I say of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, of discord, of strife, which things ought not to be found in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Let there be patience in the breast, and these things cannot have place there; or should they try to enter, they are quickly excluded and depart, that a peaceful abode may continue in the heart, where it delights the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace to dwell. Finally, the apostle warns us, and teaches, saying: <q>Grieve not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom you are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and clamour, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, be put away from you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053568"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse30">Ephesians 4:30-31</a></span> For if the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> have departed from rage and carnal contention as if from the hurricanes of the sea, and have already begun to be tranquil and meek in the harbour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he ought to admit neither <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> nor discord within his breast, since he must neither return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor bear <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.</p>

<p>17. And moreover, also, for the varied ills of the flesh, and the frequent and severe torments of the body, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is daily wearied and harassed, patience is necessary. For since in that first transgression of the commandment strength of body departed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and weakness came on with death-and strength cannot be received unless when <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> also has been received&mdash; it behooves us, in this bodily frailty and weakness, always to struggle and to fight. And this struggle and encounter cannot be sustained but by the strength of patience. But as we are to be examined and searched out, diverse sufferings are introduced; and a manifold kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> is inflicted by the losses of property, by the heats of fevers, by the torments of wounds, by the loss of those dear to us. Nor does anything distinguish between the unrighteous and the righteous more, than that in affliction the unrighteous man impatiently complains and blasphemes, while the righteous is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his patience, as it is written: <q>In pain endure, and in your low estate have patience; for gold and silver are tried in the fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053569"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse4">Sirach 2:4-5</a></span></p>

<p>18. Thus Job was searched out and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and was raised up to the very highest pinnacle of praise by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience. What darts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> were sent forth against him! What tortures were put in use! The loss of his estate is inflicted, the privation of a numerous offspring is ordained for him. The master, rich in estate, and the father, richer in children, is on a sudden neither master nor father! The wasting of wounds is added; and, moreover, an eating pest of worms consumes his festering and wasting limbs. And that nothing at all should remain that Job did not experience in his trials, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> arms his wife also, making use of that old device of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as if he could deceive and mislead all by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, even as he did in the beginning of the world. And yet Job is not broken down by his severe and repeated conflicts, nor the blessing of God withheld from being declared in the midst of those difficulties and trials of his, by the victory of patience. Tobias also, who, after the sublime works of his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy, was tried with the loss of his eyes, in proportion as he patiently endured his blindness, in that proportion deserved greatly of God by the praise of patience.</p>

<p>19. And, beloved brethren, that the benefit of patience may still more shine forth, let us consider, on the contrary, what mischief impatience may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For as patience is the benefit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so, on the other hand, impatience is the mischief of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and as one in whom Christ dwells and abides is found patient, so he appears always impatient whose mind the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> possesses. Briefly let us look at the very beginnings. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> suffered with impatience that man was made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Hence he was the first to perish and to ruin others. Adam, contrary to the heavenly command with respect to the deadly food, by impatience fell into death; nor did he keep the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> received from God under the guardianship of patience. And in order that Cain should put his brother to death, he was impatient of his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and gift; and in that <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> descended from the rights of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> to those of the younger, he lost his priority by impatience for the pottage. Why was the Jewish people faithless and ungrateful in respect of the divine benefits? Was it not the crime of impatience, that they first departed from God? Not being able to bear the delays of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> conferring with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they dared to ask for profane gods, that they might call the head of an ox and an earthen image leaders of their march; nor did they ever desist from their impatience, until, impatient always of docility and of divine admonition, they <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and all the righteous men, and plunged even into the crime of the crucifixion and bloodshedding of the Lord. Moreover, impatience makes <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, after the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, drives them in opposition to the peace and charity of Christ as rebels, to hostile and raging <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.  And, not at length to enumerate single cases, absolutely everything which patience, by its works, builds up to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, impatience casts down into ruin.</p>

<p>20. Wherefore, beloved brethren, having diligently pondered both the benefits of patience and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of impatience, let us hold fast with full watchfulness the patience whereby we abide in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that with Christ we may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which patience, copious and manifold, is not restrained by narrow limits, nor confined by strait boundaries. The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience is widely manifest, and its fertility and liberality proceed indeed from a source of one name, but are diffused by overflowing streams through many ways of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; nor can anything in our actions avail for the perfection of praise, unless from this it receives the substance of its perfection. It is patience which both commends and keeps us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is patience, too, which assuages <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which bridles the tongue, governs the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, guards peace, rules discipline, breaks the force of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, represses the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, extinguishes the fire of enmity, checks the power of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a>, soothes the want of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, protects a blessed integrity in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, a careful purity in <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, in those who are united and married a single affection. It makes men <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in prosperity, brave in adversity, gentle towards wrongs and contempts. It teaches us quickly to pardon those who wrong us; and if you yourself do wrong, to entreat long and earnestly. It resists <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, suffers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, perfects <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>. It is patience which firmly fortifies the foundations of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is this which lifts up on high the increase of our hope. It is this which directs our doing, that we may hold fast the way of Christ while we walk by His patience. It is this that makes us to persevere as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while we imitate our Father's patience.</p>

<p>21. But since I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, beloved brethren, that very many are eager, either on account of the burden or the pain of smarting wrongs, to be quickly avenged of those who act harshly and rage against them,  we must not withhold the fact in the furthest particular, that placed as we are in the midst of these storms of a jarring world, and, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> both of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we may patiently wait for the day of (God's) vengeance, and not hurry to revenge our suffering with a querulous  haste, since it is written, <q>Wait upon me, says the Lord, in the day of my rising up for a testimony; for my judgment is to the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that I may take hold on the kings, and pour out upon them my fury.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053574"><a href="../bible/zep003.htm#verse8">Zephaniah 3:8</a></span> The Lord commands us to wait,  and to bear with brave patience the day of future vengeance; and He also speaks in the Apocalypse, saying, <q>Seal not the sayings of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book: for now the time is at hand for them that persevere in injuring to injure, and for him that is filthy to be filthy still; but for him that is righteous to do things still more righteous, and likewise for him that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to do things still more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053576"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse10">Revelation 22:10-12</a></span> Whence also the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, crying out and hastening with grief breaking forth to their revenge, are bidden still to wait, and to give patience for the times to be fulfilled and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to be completed. <q>And when He had opened,</q> says he, <q>the fifth seal, I saw under the altar of God the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for their testimony; and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do You not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And there were given to them each white robes; and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season, until the number of their fellow-servants and brethren is fulfilled, who afterwards shall be slain after their example.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053577"><a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse9">Revelation 6:9-11</a></span></p>

<p>22. But when shall come the divine vengeance for the righteous blood, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> declares by Malachi the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>Behold, the day of the Lord comes, burning as an oven; and all the aliens and all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053578"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse1">Malachi 4:1</a></span> And this we read also in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, where the approach of God the Judge is announced as worthy to be reverenced for the majesty of His judgment: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come manifest, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not keep I silence; a fire shall burn before Him, and round about Him a great tempest. He shall call the heaven above, and the earth beneath, that He may separate His people. Gather His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> together unto Him, who establish His covenant in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; and the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is the Judge.</q>  And Isaiah foretells the same things, saying: <q>For, behold, the Lord shall come like a fire, and His chariot as a storm, to render vengeance in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for in the fire of the Lord they shall be judged, and with His sword shall they be wounded.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053580"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse15">Isaiah 66:15-16</a></span> And again: <q>The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and shall crumble the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to pieces; He shall stir up the battle, and shall cry out against His enemies with strength, I have held my peace; shall I always hold my peace? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note053581"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse13">Isaiah 42:13-14</a></span></p>

<p>23. But who is this that says that he has held his peace before, and will not hold his peace for ever? Surely it is He who was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is without voice, so He opened not His mouth. Surely it is He who did not cry, nor was His voice heard in the streets. Surely He who was not rebellious, neither contradicted, when He offered His back to stripes, and His cheeks to the palms of the hands; neither turned away His face from the foulness of spitting. Surely it is He who, when He was accused by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders, answered nothing, and, to the wonder of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, kept a most patient silence. This is He who, although He was silent in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, yet by and by will not be silent in His vengeance. This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, but of the faithful and believing; and He, when He shall come manifest in His second advent, will not be silent.  For although He came first shrouded in humility, yet He shall come manifest in power.</p>

<p>24. Let us wait for Him, beloved brethren, our Judge and Avenger, who shall equally avenge with Himself the congregation of His Church, and the number of all the righteous from the beginning of the world. Let him who hurries, and is too impatient for his revenge, consider that even He Himself is not yet avenged who is the Avenger. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father ordained His Son to be adored; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, mindful of the divine command, lays it down, and says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name, that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of things heavenly, and things earthly, and things beneath.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note053583"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse9">Philippians 2:9-10</a></span> And in the Apocalypse the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> withstands John, who wishes to worship him,  and says: <q>Do it not; for I am your fellow-servant, and of your brethren. Worship Jesus the Lord.</q>  How great is the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and how great is His patience, that He who is adored in heaven is not yet avenged on earth! Let us, beloved brethren, consider His patience in our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and sufferings; let us give an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> full of expectation to His advent; and let us not hasten, servants as we are, to be defended before our Lord with irreligious and immodest eagerness. Let us rather press onward and labour, and, watching with our whole heart, and steadfast to all endurance, let us keep the Lord's precepts; so that when that day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and vengeance shall come, we may not be punished with the impious and sinners, but may be honoured with the righteous and those that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God.</p>
