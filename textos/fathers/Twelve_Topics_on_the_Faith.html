<h1>Twelve Topics on the Faith</h1>

<p class="h1a">Wherein is Given Also the Formula of Excommunication, and an Explication is Subjoined to Each.</p> 

<h2>Topic 1</h2>

<p>If any one says that the body of Christ is uncreated, and refuses to acknowledge that He, being the uncreated Word (God) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took the flesh of created humanity and appeared incarnate, even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could the body be said to be uncreated? For the uncreated is the passionless, invulnerable, intangible. But Christ, on rising from the dead, showed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the print of the nails and the wound made by the spear, and a body that could be handled, although He also had entered among them when the doors were shut, with the view of showing them at once the energy of the divinity and the reality of the body.</p>

<p>Yet, while being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was recognised as man in a natural manner; and while subsisting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as man, He was also manifested as God by His works. </p>

<h2>Topic 2</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that the flesh of Christ is consubstantial with the divinity, and refuses to acknowledge that He, subsisting Himself in the form of God as God before all ages, emptied Himself and took the form of a servant, even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could the flesh, which is conditioned by time, be said to be consubstantial  with the timeless divinity? For that is designated consubstantial which is the same in nature and in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> duration without variableness.</p>

<h2>Topic 3</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just like one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, assumed the perfect man, and refuses to acknowledge that, being begotten in the flesh of the Virgin,  He became man and was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and was brought up in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and advanced in age, and on completing the set number of years (appeared in public and) was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan, and received this testimony from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060377"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could it be said that Christ (the Lord) assumed the perfect man just like one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when He, being the Lord Himself, became man by the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> effected through the Virgin? Wherefore it is written, that <q>the first man was of the earth, earthy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060378"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:47</a></span> But whereas he that was formed of the earth returned to the earth, He that became the second man returned to heaven. And so we read of the <q>first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the last Adam.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060379"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse45">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:45</a></span> And as it is admitted that the second came by the first according to the flesh, for which reason also Christ is called man and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; so is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> given that the second is the Savior of the first, for whose sake He came down from heaven. And as the Word came down from heaven, and was made man, and ascended again to heaven, He is on that account said to be the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from heaven.</p>

<h2>Topic 4</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that Christ was born of the seed of man by the Virgin, in the same manner as all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are born, and refuses to acknowledge that He was made flesh by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, mad became man of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that Christ was born of the seed of man by the Virgin, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, in proclaiming the good tidings, testify of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Virgin</a> that she said, <q>How shall this be, seeing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not a man? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060380"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;1:34</a></span> Wherefore he says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of the Highest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060381"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> And to Joseph he says, <q>Fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060382"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20-21</a></span></p>

<h2>Topic 5</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who is before the ages is one, and He who has appeared in these last times is another, and refuses to acknowledge that He who is before the ages is the same with Him who appeared in these last times, even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could it be said that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who is before the ages, and He who has appeared in these last times, are different, when the Lord Himself says, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I am; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060383"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John 8:58</a></span> and, <q>I came forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I come, and again I go to my Father? </q> </p>

<h2>Topic 6</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that He who suffered is one, and that He who suffered not is another, and refuses to acknowledge that the Word, who is Himself the impassibie and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, suffered in the flesh which He had assumed really, yet without mutation, even as it is written,</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could it be said that He who suffered is one, and He who suffered not another, when the Lord Himself says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things, and be killed, and be raised again the third day from the dead; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060385"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew 16:21</a></span> and again, <q>When you see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> sitting on the right hand of the Father; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060386"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse64">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse62">Mark 14:62</a></span> and again, <q>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060387"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse27">Matthew 16:27</a></span></p>

<h2>Topic 7</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is saved, and refuses to acknowledge that He is the Saviour of the world, and the Light of the world, even as it is written,  let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is saved, when the Lord Himself says, <q>I am the life; </q>  and, <q>I have come that they might have life; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060390"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse10">John 10:10</a></span> and, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me shall not see death, but he shall behold the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060391"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse51">John 8:51</a></span></p>

<h2>Topic 8</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is perfect man and also <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> in the way of separation,  and refuses to acknowledge the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, even as it is written, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is perfect man and also <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> in the way of separation, when the Lord Himself says, <q>Why do you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which I have heard of God? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060393"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse40">John 8:40</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> did not give a man for us, but He gave Himself for us, having been made man for our sake. Wherefore He says: <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. But He spoke of the temple of His body.</q> </p>

<h2>Topic 9</h2>

<p>If any one says that Christ suffers change or alteration, and refuses to acknowledge that He is unchangeable in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, though corruptible <span class="stiki" id="note060395"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse20">John 2:20-21</a></span> in the flesh,  let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that Christ suffers change or alteration, when the Lord Himself says, <q>I am and change not;<span class="stiki" id="note060397"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi 3:6</a></span> again, His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall not be left in Hades, neither shall His flesh see corruption? </q> </p>

<h2>Topic 10</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that Christ assumed the man only in part, and refuses to acknowledge that He was made in all things like us, apart from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that Christ assumed the man only in part, when the Lord Himself says, <q>I lay down my life, that I might take it again, for the sheep; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060399"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John 10:17</a></span> and, <q>My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060400"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse55">John 6:55</a></span> and, <q>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060401"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John 6:56</a></span></p>

<h2>Topic 11</h2>

<p>If any one affirms that the body of Christ is void of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and understanding,  and refuses to acknowledge that He is perfect man, one and the same in all things (with us), let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that the body of the Lord (Christ) is void of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and understanding? For perturbation, and grief, and distress, are not the properties either of a flesh void of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> void of understanding; nor are they the sign of the immutable Divinity, nor the index of a mere phantasm, nor do they mark the defect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness; but the Word exhibited in Himself the exercise of the affections and susceptibilities proper to us, having endued Himself with our passibility, even as it is written, that <q>He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060403"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a></span> For perturbation, and grief, and distress, are disorders of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and toil, and sleep, and the body's liability to wounding, are infirmities of the flesh.</p>

<h2>Topic 12</h2>

<p>If any one says that Christ was manifested in the world only in semblance, and refuses to acknowledge that He came actually in the flesh, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Explication</em></p>

<p>How could one say that Christ was manifested only in semblance in the world, born as He was in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and made to submit to the circumcising of the flesh, and lifted up by Simeon, and brought up on to His twelfth year (at home), and made subject to His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Jordan, and nailed to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and raised again from the dead?</p>

<p>Wherefore, when it is said that He was <q>troubled in spirit,</q>  that <q>He was sorrowful in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060405"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew 26:38</a></span> that <q>He was wounded in body,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060406"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah 53:5</a></span> He places before us designations of susceptibilities proper to our constitution, in order to show that He was made man in the world, and had His conversation with men, <span class="stiki" id="note060407"><a href="../bible/bar003.htm#verse38">Baruch 3:38</a></span> yet without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For He was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> according to the flesh, in a manner meet for Deity, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven recognising Him as their Lord, and hymning as their God Him who was then wrapped in swaddling-clothes in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, and exclaiming, <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060408"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span> He was brought up in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>; but in divine fashion He sat among the doctors, and astonished them by a wisdom beyond His years, in respect of the capacities of His bodily life, as is recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Jordan, not as receiving any sanctification for Himself, but as gifting a participation in sanctification to others. He was tempted in the wilderness, not as giving way, however, to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but as putting our <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> before Himself on the challenge of the tempter, in order to show the powerlessness of the tempter.</p>

<p>Wherefore He says, <q>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060409"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> And this He said, not as holding before us any contest proper only to a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as showing our own flesh in its capacity to overcome suffering, and death, and corruption, in order that, as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world by flesh, and death came to reign by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh might also be condemned through the selfsame flesh in the likeness thereof;  and that that overseer of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the tempter, might be overcome, and death be cast down from its sovereignty, and the corruption in the burying of the body be done away, and the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the resurrection be shown, and the principle of righteousness begin its course in the world through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> be preached to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and fellowship be established between God and men.</p>

<p>In behalf of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> let us glorify the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who has given His only begotten Son for the life of the world. Let us glorify the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that works in us, and quickens us, and furnishes the gifts meet for the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and let us not intermeddle with the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by lifeless disputations, scattering about endless questionings and logomachies, and making a hard thing of the gentle and simple word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but rather let us work the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace, let us exhibit concord, let us preserve unity, let us cultivate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is well pleased.</p>

<p>As it is not for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or the seasons which the Father has put in His own power,<span class="stiki" id="note060411"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a></span> but only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there will come an end to time, and that there will be a manifestation of a future world, and a revelation of judgment, and an advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a recompense of works, and an inheritance in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, so it is not for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became man; for this is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, as it is written, <q>Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060412"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah 53:8</a></span> But it is for us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became man, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and that He was seen on the earth, and had His conversation with men, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in their likeness, yet without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and that He died for us, and rose again from the dead, as it is written; and that He was taken up to heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead, as it is written; lest, while we <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against each other with words, any should be led to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that should come to pass which is written, <q>By reason of you is my name  continually <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060414"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah 52:5</a></span></p>
