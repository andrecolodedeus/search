<h1>Two Epistles on Virginity</h1>

<h2>First Epistle</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1. The Salutation.</h3>

<p>To all those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and cherish their life <em>which is</em> in Christ through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; to those who bear affection towards their brethren and towards their neighbours in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to the blessed <em>brother</em> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,  who devote themselves to preserve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> <q>for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080293"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> and to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <em>sister</em> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: the peace which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<h3>Chapter 2. For True Virginity Perfect Virtue is Necessary.</h3>

<p>Of all <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of either sex who have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> resolved to preserve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>&mdash; of each and every one of them it is required that he be worthy of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> in every thing. For not by eloquence  or renown,  by station  and descent, or by beauty or strength, or by length of life,  is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> obtained; but it is obtained by the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when a man exhibits the works of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For whosoever is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> righteous, his works testify concerning his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a believer, with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is great, a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is perfect, a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which shines in good works, that the Father of all may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through Christ. Now, those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> for the sake of God give heed to Him who has said, <q>Let not righteousness and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail you; bind them on your neck, and you shall find favour for yourself, and devise <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things before God and before men.</q>  <q>The paths,</q> therefore, <q>of the righteous shine as the light, and the light of them advances until the day is perfect.</q>  For the beams of their light illumine the whole creation even now by good works, as those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>the light of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080301"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> giving light to <q>those who sit in darkness,</q>  that they may arise and go forth from the darkness by the light of the good works of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>that they may see our good works and glorify our Father who is in heaven.</q>  For it is required of the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that in all his words and works he be perfect, and that in his life he be adorned with all exemplary and well-ordered behaviour,  and do all his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in righteousness, as a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. True Virgins Prove Themselves Such by Self-Denial, as Does the True Believer by Good Works.</h3>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are a beautiful pattern to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and to those who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. The name alone, indeed, without works, does not introduce into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but, if a man be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a believer, such an one can be saved. For, if a person be only called a believer in name, while he is not such in works, he cannot possibly be a believer. <q>Let no one,</q> therefore, <q>lead you astray with the empty words of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080305"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse6">Ephesians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> For, merely because a person is called a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, if he be destitute of works excellent and comely, and suitable to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, he cannot possibly be saved. For our Lord called such <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as that <q>foolish,</q> as He said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note080306"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;25:2</a></span> and because it had neither oil nor light, it was left outside of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and was shut out from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the bridegroom, and was reckoned with His enemies. For such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as these <q>have the appearance only of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the power of it they deny.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080307"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For they <q>think with themselves that they are something, while they are nothing, and are deceived. But let every one constantly try  his works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080309"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself; for empty worship does he offer, whosoever he be that makes profession of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, <q>and denies its power.</q> For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of such a kind is impure, and disowned by all good works. For <q>every tree whatsoever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from its fruits.</q>  <q>See that you understand  what I say: God will give you understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080312"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:7</a></span> For whosoever engages before God to preserve <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> must be girded with all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, if with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  he crucify his body, he for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God excuses himself from that word <em>in</em> which <em>the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a></em> has said: <q>Be fruitful, and multiply,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080315"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> and <em>shuns</em> all the display, and care, and sensuality,  and fascination of this world, and its revelries and its <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and all its luxury and ease, and withdraws from the entire life of  this world, and from its snares, and nets, and hindrances; and, while you walk  upon the earth, be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> that your work and your business be in heaven.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Continuation of the Remarks on Self-Denial; Object and Reward of True Virgins.</h3>

<p>For he who <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> for himself these things <em>so</em> great and excellent, withdraws and severs himself on this account from all the world, that he may go <em>and</em> live a life divine and heavenly, like the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in work pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and <q>in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080320"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> and that he may serve God Almighty through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. On this account he severs himself from all the appetites of the body. And not only does he excuse himself from this <em>command</em>, <q>Be fruitful, and multiply,</q> but he longs for the <q>hope promised</q> and prepared <q>and laid up in heaven</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080321"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has declared with His mouth, and He does not lie, that it is <q>better than sons and daughters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080322"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;56:4-5</a></span> and that He will give to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> a notable place in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <em>something</em> <q>better than sons and daughters,</q> and better than <em>the place of</em> those who have passed a wedded life in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and whose <q>bed has not been defiled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080323"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> For God will give to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by reason of this great and noble profession.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. The Irksomeness and the Enemies of Virginity.</h3>

<p>You desire, then, to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>? Do you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> what hardship and irksomeness there is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>&mdash; that which stands constantly at all seasons before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and does not withdraw <em>from His service</em>, and <q>is anxious how it may please its Lord with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body, and with <em>its</em> spirit?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080324"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:34</a></span> Do you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> what great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and is it for this that you <em>set yourself to</em> practise it? Do you really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and understand what it is you are eager to do? Are you acquainted with the noble task of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? Do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to enter <q>lawfully</q> upon  this contest and <q>strive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080326"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> that, in the might of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,  you choose this for yourself, that you may be crowned with a crown of light, and that they may lead you about <em>in triumph</em> through <q>the Jerusalem above</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note080328"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> If so be, then, that you long for all these things, conquer the body; conquer the appetites of the flesh; conquer the world in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; conquer these vain things of time, which pass away and grow old, and decay, and come to an end; conquer the dragon; <span class="stiki" id="note080329"><a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse7">Revelation&nbsp;12:7</a></span> conquer the lion; <span class="stiki" id="note080330"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> conquer the serpent; <span class="stiki" id="note080331"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> conquer <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>&mdash;through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who does strengthen you by the hearing of His words and the divine <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>.  <q>Take up your cross and follow</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080333"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24</a></span> Him who makes you clean, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> your Lord. Strive to run straight forward and boldly, not with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, relying on the promise of your Lord, that you shall obtain the victor-crown  of your <q>calling on high</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080335"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse14">Philippians&nbsp;3:14</a></span> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For whosoever walks perfect in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not fearing, does in very deed receive the crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which is great in its toil and great in its reward. Do you understand and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> a thing is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>?  Do you understand how great and exalted and excellent is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? </p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Divinity of Virginity.</h3>

<p>The womb of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin  carried <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and the body which our Lord wore, and in which He carried on the conflict in this world, He put on from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin. From this, therefore, understand the greatness and dignity of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Do you wish to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Imitate Christ in everything. John, the ambassador, he who came before our Lord, he <q>than whom there was not a greater among those born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080339"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> messenger of our Lord, was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Imitate, therefore, the ambassador of our Lord, and be his follower  in every thing. <em>That</em> John, again, who <q>reclined on the bosom of our Lord, and whom He greatly loved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080341"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;21:20</a></span> &mdash; he, too, was a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> person.  For it was not without reason that our Lord loved him. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, also, and Barnabas, and Timothy, with all the others, <q>whose names are written in the book of life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080343"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse3">Philippians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> &mdash; these, I say, all cherished and loved <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>,  and ran in the contest, and finished their course without blemish, as imitators of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as sons of the living God. Moreover, also, Elijah and Elisha, and many other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, we find to have lived a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>  and spotless life. If, therefore, you desire to be like these, imitate them with all your power. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said, <q>The elders who are among you, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; and, seeing their manner of life and conduct, imitate their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080346"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse7">Hebrews&nbsp;13:7</a></span> And again it says, <q>Imitate me, my brethren, as I <em>imitate</em> Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080347"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:1</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 7. The True Virgin.</h3>

<p>Those, therefore, who imitate Christ, imitate Him earnestly. For those who have <q>put on Christ</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080348"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, express His likeness in their thoughts, and in their whole life, and in all their behaviour: in word, and in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and in patience, and in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and in long-suffering, and in a pure heart, and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in hope, and in full and perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God. No virgin, therefore, unless they be in everything as Christ, and as those <q>who are Christs,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080349"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;5:24</a></span> can be saved. For every virgin who is in God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in her body and in her spirit, and is constant in the service of her Lord, not turning away from it any whither, but waiting upon Him always in purity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being <q>solicitous how she may please her Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080350"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:32</a></span> <em>by living</em> purely and without stain, and solicitous to be pleasing before Him in every thing. She who is such does not withdraw from our Lord, but in spirit is <em>ever</em> with her Lord: as it is written, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, says the Lord.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Virgins, by the Laying Aside of All Carnal Affection, are Imitators of God.</h3>

<h3>Chapter 10. Denunciation of Dangerous and Scandalous Association with Maidens.</h3>

<p>Now, we are persuaded of you, my brethren, that your thoughts are occupied about those things which are requisite for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  But we speak thus  in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rumours and reports concerning shameless men, who, under pretext of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have their dwelling with maidens, and <em>so</em>, expose themselves to danger, and walk with them along the road and in solitary places  alone&mdash; a course which is full of dangers, and full of stumbling-blocks and snares and pitfalls; nor is it in any respect right for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God so to conduct themselves. Others, too, eat and drink with them at entertainments <em>allowing themselves</em> in loose behaviour and much uncleanness&mdash; such as ought not to be among <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and especially among those who have chosen for themselves <em>a life of</em> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.  Others, again, meet together for vain and trifling conversation and merriment, and that they may speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of one another; and they hunt up tales against one another, and are idle: <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with whom we do not allow you even to eat bread. Then, others wander about among the houses of virgin brethren or sisters, on pretence of visiting them, or reading the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <em>to them</em>, or exorcising them. Forasmuch as they are idle and do no work, they pry into those things which ought not to be inquired into, and by means of plausible words make merchandise of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <em>These are</em> men from whom the divine apostle kept aloof, because of the multitude of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <em><a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em>; as it is written: <q>Thorns sprout in the hands of the idle;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080383"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse9">Proverbs&nbsp;26:9</a></span> and, <q>The ways of the idle are full of thorns.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 11. Perniciousness of Idleness; Warning Against the Empty Longing to Be Teachers; Advice About Teaching and the Use of Divine Gifts.</h3>

<p>Such are the ways of all those who do not work, but go hunting for tales, and think to themselves that this is profitable and right.  For such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are like those idle and prating <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> <q>who go wandering about  among houses</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080387"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:13</a></span> with their prating, and hunt for idle tales, and carry them from house to house with much exaggeration, without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And besides all this, barefaced men as they are,  under pretence of teaching, they set forth a variety of doctrines. And would that they taught the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! But it is this which is <em>so</em> disquieting, that they understand not what they mean, and assert that which is not <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em>: because they wish to be teachers, and to display themselves as skilful  in speaking; because they traffic in iniquity in the name of Christ&mdash; which it is not right for the servants of God <em>to do</em>. And they hearken not to that which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said: <q>Let not many be teachers among you, my brethren, and be not all of you <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q>  For <q>he who does not transgress in word is a perfect man, able to keep down and subjugate his whole body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080390"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> And, <q>If a man speak, let him speak in the words  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080392"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:11</a></span> And, <q>If there is in you understanding, give an answer to your brother but if not, put your hand on your mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080393"><a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse14">Sirach&nbsp;5:14</a></span> For, <q>at one time <em>it is proper</em> to keep silence, and at another you to speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080394"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:7</a></span> And again it says <q>When a man speaks in season, it is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>  to him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080396"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse11">Proverbs&nbsp;25:11</a></span> And again it says: <q>Let your speech be seasoned with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is required of a man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give an answer to every one in season.</q>  For <q>he that utters whatsoever comes to his mouth, that man produces strife; and he that utters a superfluity of words increases vexation; and he that is hasty with his lips falls into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For because of the unruliness of the tongue comes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; but the perfect man keeps watch over his tongue, and loves his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> life.</q>  For these are they <q>who by good words and fair speeches lead astray the hearts of the simple, and, while offering them blessings, lead them astray.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080399"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;16:17-19</a></span> Let us, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the judgment which awaits teachers.

<h3>Chapter 12. Rules for Visits, Exorcisms, and How People are to Assist the Sick, and to Walk in All Things Without Offence.</h3>

<p>Moreover, also, this is comely and useful, that a man <q>visit <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080409"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse27">James&nbsp;1:27</a></span> and especially those poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have many children. These things are, without controversy, required of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and comely and suitable for them. This also, again, is suitable and right and comely for those who are brethren in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they should visit those who are harassed by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and pronounce adjurations  over them, intelligently, <em>offering</em> such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as is acceptable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not with a multitude of fine words,  well prepared and arranged, so that they may appear to men eloquent and of a good memory. <em>Such men</em> are <q>like a sounding pipe, or a tinkling cymbal;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080412"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:1</a></span> and they bring no help to those over whom they make their adjurations; but they speak with terrible words, and affright people, but do not act with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to the teaching of our Lord, who has said: <q>This kind goes not out but by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,</q>  offered unceasingly and with earnest mind.

In this way let us approach a brother or a sister who is sick, and visit them in a way that is right, without guile, and without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and without noise, and without talkativeness, and without such behaviour as is alien from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and without haughtiness, but with the meek and lowly spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let them, therefore, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> make their adjurations, and not with the elegant and well-arranged and fitly-ordered words of learning, but as men who have received the gift of healing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, confidently, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God. By  your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and perpetual watching, together with your other good works, mortify the works of the flesh by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.

Our Lord has said: <q>Cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>,</q> at the same time <em>commanding</em> many other acts of healing; and, <q>Freely you have received, freely give.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080416"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;10:8</a></span> For such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as these a goodly recompense is <em>laid up</em> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they serve their brethren with the gifts which have been given them by the Lord. This is also comely and helpful to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they act according to the injunctions of our Lord, who has said: <q>I was sick, and you visited Me, and so on.</q>  And this is comely and right and just, that we visit our neighbours for the sake of God with all seemliness of manner and purity of behaviour; as the Apostle has said: <q>Who is sick, and I am not sick? Who is offended, and I am not offended?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080418"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> But all these things are spoken in reference to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which a man should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbour. And in these things let us occupy ourselves,  without giving offense, and let us not do anything with partiality or for the shaming of others, but let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the poor as the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and especially let us visit them. For this is comely before God and before men, that we should remember the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and be lovers of the brethren and of strangers, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the sake of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have learned from the law and from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of strangers: for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the words which have been spoken concerning the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of strangers;  powerfully are the words spoken to all those who do them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13. What Priests Should Be and Should Not Be.</h3>

<p>Beloved brethren! That a man should build up and establish the brethren on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this also is manifest and well-known. This too, again, is comely, that a man should not be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of his neighbour. And moreover, again, it is suitable and comely that all those who work the works of the Lord should work the works of the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus is it required of them to conduct themselves. That <q>the harvest is great, but the workmen are few,</q> this also is well-known and manifest. Let us, therefore, <q>ask of the Lord of the harvest</q> that He would send forth workmen into the harvest; <span class="stiki" id="note080421"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;9:37-38</a></span> such workmen as <q>shall skilfully dispense the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> workmen <q>who shall not be ashamed;</q>  faithful workmen; workmen who shall be <q>the light of the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080423"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> workmen who <q>work not for the food that perishes, but for that food which abides unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080424"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> workmen who shall be such as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; workmen who imitate the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; who are concerned for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men; not <q>hireling</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080425"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;10:12-13</a></span> workmen; not workmen to whom the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and righteousness appear to be gain; not workmen who <q>serve their belly;</q> not workmen who <q>with fair speeches and pleasant words mislead the hearts of the innocent;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080426"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;16:18</a></span> not workmen who imitate the children of light, while they are not light but darkness&mdash; <q>men whose end is destruction;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080427"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse9">Philippians&nbsp;3:9</a></span> not workmen who practise iniquity and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and fraud; not <q>crafty workmen;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080428"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:13</a></span> not workmen <q>drunken</q> and <q>faithless;</q>  nor workmen who traffic in Christ;  not misleaders; not <q>lovers of money; not malevolent.</q> </p>

<p>Let us, therefore, contemplate and imitate the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who have conducted themselves well in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, as is becoming and suitable to our calling and profession.

<h2>Second Epistle</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1. He Describes the Circumspectness of His Intercourse with the Other Sex, and Tells How in His Journeys He Acts at Places Where There are Brethren Only.</h3>

<p>I would, moreover, have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, my brethren, of what sort is our conduct in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as well as that of all our brethren, in the <em>various</em> places in which we are. And if so be that you approve it, do ye also conduct yourselves in like manner in the Lord. Now we, if God help us, conduct ourselves thus: with maidens we do not dwell, nor have we anything in common with them; with maidens we do not eat, nor drink; and, where a maiden sleeps, we do not sleep; neither do <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wash our feet, nor anoint us; and on no account do we sleep where a maiden sleeps who is unmarried or has taken the vow:  even though she be in some other place <em>if she be</em> alone, we do not pass the night there.  Moreover, if it chance that the time <em>for rest</em> overtake us in a place, whether in the country, or in a village, or in a town, or in a hamlet,  or wheresoever we happen to be, and there are found brethren in that place, we turn in to one who is a brother, and call together there all the brethren, and speak to them words of encouragement and exhortation.  And those among us who are gifted in speaking will speak such words as are earnest, and serious, and chaste, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <em>exhort them</em> to please God in everything, and abound and go forward in good works, and <q>be free from  anxious care in everything,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080438"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> as is fit and right for the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2. His Behaviour in Places Where There Were Christians of Both Sexes.</h3>

<p>And if, moreover, it chance that we are distant from our homes and from our neighbours, and the day decline and the eventide overtake us, and the brethren press us, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood and by reason of their affection for strangers, to stay with them, so that we may watch with them, and they may hear the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and do <em>it</em>, and be fed with the words of the Lord, so that they may be mindful of them, and they set before us bread and water and that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provides, and we be willing and consent to stay through the night with them; if there be there a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man,  with him we turn in and lodge, and that same brother will provide and prepare whatever is necessary for us; and he himself waits upon us, and he himself washes our feet for us and anoints us with ointment, and he himself gets ready a bed for us, that we may sleep in reliance on God. All these things will that <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> brother, who is in the place in which we tarry, do in his own person. He will himself serve the brethren, and each one of the brethren who are in the same place will join with him in rendering all those services  which are requisite for the brethren. But with us may no female, whether young maiden or married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, be there at that time;  nor she that is aged,  nor she that has taken the vow; not even a maid-servant, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; but there shall only be men with men. And, if we see it to be requisite to stand and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and to speak words of exhortation and edification, we call <em>together</em> the brethren and all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sisters and maidens, <em>and</em> likewise all the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are there, <em>inviting them</em> with all modesty and becoming behaviour to come and feast on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  And those among us who are skilled in speaking speak to them, and exhort them in those words which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given us. And then we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and salute  one another, the men the men. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the maidens will wrap their hands in their garments; <em>and</em> we also, with circumspection and with all purity, our eyes looking upwards, shall wrap our right hand in our garments; and then they will come and give us the salutation on our right hand wrapped in our garments. Then we go where God permits us.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Rules for the Conduct of Celibate Brethren in Places Where There are Only Married Christians.</h3>

<p>And if again we chance to come into a place where there is no <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> brother, but all are married, all those who are there will receive the brother who comes to them, and minister to him, and care for his wants  in everything, assiduously, with good-will. And the brother shall be ministered to by them in the way that is suitable.  And the brother will say to the married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are in that place: We <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men do not eat or drink with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor are we waited on by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> or by maidens, nor do <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wash our feet for us, nor do <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> anoint us, nor do <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> prepare our bed for us, nor do we sleep where <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sleep, so that we may be without reproach in everything, lest any one should be offended or stumble at us. And, while we observe all these things, <q>we are without offense to every man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080446"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> As <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, <q>who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are made manifest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080447"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Conduct of the Holy Man Where There are Women Only.</h3>

<p>But if we chance to come into a place where there are no <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></em> men, but all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and maidens,  and they press us to pass the night there in that place, we call them all together to some suitable place,  and ask them how they do; and according to that which we learn from them, and what we see to be their state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we address them in a suitable manner, as men fearing God. And when they have all assembled and come <em>together</em>, and we see that they are in peace,  we address to them words of exhortation in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> to them, with purity and in the concise  and weighty words of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We do everything as for their edification. And as to those who are married, we speak to them in the Lord in a manner suited to them. And if, moreover, the day decline and the eventide draw on, we select, in order to pass the night there, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is aged and the most exemplary  of them all; and we speak to her to give us a place all to ourselves, where no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> enters, nor maiden. And this old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself will bring us a lamp, and whatever is requisite for us she will herself bring us. From <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the brethren, she will bring whatever is requisite for the service of stranger brethren. And she herself, when the time for sleep has come, will depart and go to her house in peace.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Where There is Only One Woman, the Father Does Not Make a Stay; How Carefully Stumbling-Blocks Must Be Avoided.</h3>

<p>But if, moreover, we chance upon a place, and find there one believing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> only, and no other person be there but she only, we do not stop there, nor <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there, nor read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> there, but we flee as from before the face of a serpent, and as from before the face of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Not that we disdain the believing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash; far be it from us to be so minded towards our brethren in Christ!&mdash; but, because she is alone, we are afraid lest any one should make insinuations against us in words of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For the hearts of men are firmly set  on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And, that we may not give a pretext to those who desire to get a pretext against us and to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of us, and that we may not be a stumbling-block to any one, on this account we cut off the pretext of those who desire to get a pretext against us; on this account we must be <q>on our guard that we be to no one a stumbling-block, neither to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, nor yet to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>; and we must not seek that which is profitable to ourselves only, but that which is for the profit of many, so that they may be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080454"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:32-33</a></span> For this does not profit us, that another stumble because of us. Let us, therefore, be studiously on our guard at all times, that we do not smite our brethren and give them to drink of a disquieting <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> through our being to them a stumbling-block. For <q>if for the sake of meat our brother be made sad, or shocked, or made weak, or caused to stumble, we are not walking in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the sake of meat you cause him to perish for whose sake Christ died.</q>  For, <em>in</em> <q>thus sinning against your brethren and wounding their sickly <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>, you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Christ Himself. For, if for the sake of meat my brother is made to stumble,</q> let us <em>who are</em> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> say, <q>Never will we eat flesh, that we may not make our brother to stumble.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080456"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:12-13</a></span> These things, moreover, does ever one who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> takes up his cross, and puts on Christ, and loves his neighbour; the man who watches over himself that he be not a stumbling-block to any one, that no one be caused to stumble because of him and die because he is constantly with maidens and lives in the same house with them&mdash; a thing which is not right&mdash; to the overthrow of those who see and hear. Evil conduct like this is fraught with stumbling and peril, and <em>is</em> akin  to death. But blessed is that man who is circumspect and fearful in everything for the sake of purity!</p>

<h3>Chapter 6. How Christians Should Behave Themselves Among Heathens.</h3>

<p>If, moreover, it chance that we go to a place in which there are no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and it be important  for us to stay there a few days, let us be <q>wise as serpents, and harmless as doves;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080458"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> and let us <q>not be as the foolish, but as the wise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080459"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;5:15</a></span> in all the <em>self</em>-restraint of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that God may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in everything through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through our chaste and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> behaviour. For, <q>whether we eat, or drink, or do anything else, let us do it as for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080460"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:31</a></span> Let <q>all those who see us acknowledge that we are a blessed seed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080461"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;61:9</a></span> <q>sons of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080462"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> in everything&mdash; in all <em>our</em> words in shamefastness, in purity, in humility, forasmuch as we do not copy the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> in anything, nor are <em>as</em> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> like <em>other</em> men, but in everything are estranged from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And we <q>do not cast that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> before dogs, nor pearls before swine;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080463"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> but with all possible <em>self</em>-restraint, and with all discretion, and with all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with earnestness of mind we praise God. For we do not minister where <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are drinking and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> in their feasts with words of impurity, because of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.  Therefore do we not sing <em>psalms</em> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, nor do we read to them the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that we may not be like <em>common</em> singers, either those who play on the lyre,  or those who sing with the voice, or <em>like</em> soothsayers, as many are, who follow these practices and do these things, that they may sate themselves with a paltry mouthful of bread, and who, for the sake of a sorry cup of wine, go <em>about</em> <q>singing the songs of the Lord in the strange land</q>  of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and doing what is not right. Do not so, my brethren; we beseech you, my brethren, let not these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> be done among you; but put away those who choose thus to behave themselves with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and disgrace. It is not proper, my brethren, that these things should be so. But we beseech you, brethren in righteousness, that these things be so <em>done</em> with you as with us, as for a pattern of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and of those who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Let us be of the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in all righteousness, and in all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unblemished conduct, behaving ourselves with uprightness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, as is right for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and observing those things which are praiseworthy, and pure, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and noble; and do ye promote  all those things which are profitable. For you are <q>our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and our crown,</q> and our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and our life, <q>if so be that you stand in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080468"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse1">Philippians&nbsp;4:1</a></span> So be it! </p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Uses of Considering Admonitory Examples, as Well as Instructive Patterns.</h3>

<p>Let us consider, therefore, my brethren, and see how all the righteous fathers conducted themselves during the whole time of their sojourn in <em>this</em> life, and let us search and examine from the law <em>down</em> to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. For this is both becoming and profitable, that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many men there have been, and who <em>they were</em>, that have perished through <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and who and how many have been the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that have perished through men, by reason of the constancy with which they have associated with one another. And further, also, for the same reason, I will show how many have been the men, and who <em>they were</em>, that lived all their lifetime, and continued even to the close, with one another in <em>the performance of</em> chaste works without blemish. And it is manifest and well-known that this is so. </p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Joseph and Potiphar's Wife; Of What Kind Love to Females Ought to Be.</h3>

<p> <em>There is</em> Joseph, faithful, and intelligent, and wise, and who feared God in everything. Did not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> conceive an excessive passion for the beauty of this chaste and upright man? And, when he would not yield and consent to gratify her passionate desire,  she cast the righteous man into every kind of distress and torment, to within a little of death,  by <em>bearing</em> false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. But God delivered him from all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that came upon him through <em>this</em> wretched <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. You see, my brethren, what distresses the constant sight of the person of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> brought upon the righteous man. Therefore, let us not be constantly with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor with maidens. For this is not profitable for those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wish to <q>gird up their loins.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080473"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35</a></span> For it is required that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sisters in all purity and chasteness, and with all curbing of thought, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not associating constantly with them, nor finding access to them at every hour.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Samson's Admonitory Fall.</h3>

Are you, perchance, such a man as he? Know yourself, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the measure of your strength.  <q>The married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> catches precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080476"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse26">Proverbs&nbsp;6:26</a></span> Therefore, we do not allow any man whatsoever to sit with a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; much less to live in the same house with a maiden who has taken the vow, or to sleep where she sleeps, or to be constantly with her. For this is to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and abominated by those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10. David's Sin, So Admonitory to Us Weak Men.</h3>

<p>Does not the case of David instruct you, whom God <q>found a man after His heart,</q>  one faithful, faultless, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? This same man saw the beauty of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash; I mean of Bathsheba&mdash; when he saw her as she was cleansing herself and washing unclothed. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man saw, and was thoroughly  captivated with desire by the sight of her.  See, then, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> he committed because of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and <em>how</em> this righteous man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and gave command that the husband of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be killed in battle. You have seen what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> schemes he laid and executed, and <em>how</em>, because of his passion for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he perpetrated a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>&mdash; <em>he</em>, David, who was called <q>the anointed of the Lord.</q>  Be admonished, O man: for, if such men as these have been brought to ruin through <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, what is <em>your</em> righteousness, or what are you among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, that you consort with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and with maidens day and night, with much silliness, without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God? Not <em>thus</em>, my brethren, not thus let us conduct ourselves; but let us be mindful of that word which is spoken concerning a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: <q>Her hands lay snares, and her heart spreads nets; but the just shall escape from her, while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> falls into her hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080481"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse26">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:26</a></span> Therefore let us, who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>,  be careful not to live in the same house with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> who have taken the vow. For such conduct as this is not becoming nor right for the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11. Admonitory History of the Incestuous Children of David.</h3>

<p>Have you not read concerning Amnon and Tamar, the children of David? This Amnon conceived a passion for his sister, and humbled her, and did not spare her, because he longed for her with a shameful passion; and he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and profligate because of his constant intercourse with her, without the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he <q>wrought uncleanness in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080483"><a href="../bible/gen034.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;34:7</a></span> Therefore, it is not proper for us, nor right for us, to associate with sisters, <em>indulging</em> in laughter and looseness; but <em>we ought to behave towards them</em> with all chasteness and purity, and in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12. Solomon's Infatuation Through Women.</h3>

<p>Have you not read the history of Solomon, the son of David, the man to whom God gave wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and largeness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  and riches, and much <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Yet this same man, through <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, came to ruin,  and departed from the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13. The History of Susanna Teaches Circumspection with the Eyes and in Society.</h3>

<p>Have you not read, and do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, concerning those elders who were in the days of Susanna, who, because they were constantly with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and looking upon the beauty which was another's,  fell into the depths of wantonness, and were not able to keep themselves in a chaste <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  but were overcome by a depraved disposition, and came suddenly  upon the blessed Susanna to corrupt her. But she did not consent to their foul passion, but cried unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God saved her out of the hands of the bad old men. Does it not, therefore, behoove us to tremble and be afraid, forasmuch as these old men, judges and elders of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fell from their dignity because of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For they did not keep in mind that which is said: <q>Look not on the beauty which is another's;</q> and, <q>The beauty of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has destroyed many;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080489"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse8">Sirach&nbsp;9:8-9</a></span> and <q>With a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> do not sit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080490"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;9:12</a></span> and that, again, <em>in</em> which it says: <q>Is there any one that puts fire in his bosom, and does not burn his clothes;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080491"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;6:27</a></span> or, <q>Does a man walk on fire, and his feet are not scorched? So whosoever goes in to another man's wife is not pure from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and whosoever comes near to her shall not escape.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080492"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;6:28-29</a></span> And again it says: <q>You shall not long after the beauty a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, lest she take you captive with her eyelids;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080493"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;6:25</a></span> and, <q>You shall not look upon a maiden, lest you perish through desire of her;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080494"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse5">Sirach&nbsp;9:5</a></span> and, <q>With a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that sings beautifully you shall not constantly be;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080495"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse4">Sirach&nbsp;9:4</a></span> and, <q>Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080496"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 14. Examples of Circumspect Behaviour from the Old Testament.</h3>

<p>But see what it says also concerning <em>those</em> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of our Lord. Let us see whether any one of <em>these</em> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men was constantly with maidens, or with young married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or with such <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> as the divine apostle declines to receive. Let us consider, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the manner of life of <em>these</em> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. Lo! We find it written concerning <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, that they acted and lived in the company of  men, who <em>themselves also</em> followed a course of conduct like theirs. And thus <em>did</em> Joshua also, the son of Nun. Woman was there none with them; but they by themselves used holily to minister before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, men with men. And not only so; but they taught the people, that, whenever the host moved, every tribe should move on apart, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> apart, and that they should go into the rear behind the host, and the men also apart by their tribes. And, according to the command of the Lord, so did they set out, like a wise people, that there might be no disorder on account of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> when the host moved. With beautiful and well-ordered arrangements did they march without stumbling. For lo! The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> bear testimony to my words: <q>When the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had crossed over the Sea of Suth, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sang the praises of the Lord, and said: We will praise the Lord, because He is exceedingly to be praised.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080498"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;15:1</a></span> And, after that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had finished  singing praises, then Miriam, the sister of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, took a timbrel in her hands, and all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> went out after her, and sang praises with her, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> apart, and men with men apart. Then again, we find that Elisha and Gehazi and the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> lived together in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they had no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> living with them. Micah <em>too</em>, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> likewise, we find to have lived in this manner in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15. The Example of Jesus; How We May Allow Ourselves to Be Served by Women.</h3>

<p>And, not to extend our discourse to <em>too</em> great length, what shall we say concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>? Our Lord Himself was constantly with His twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when He had come <em>forth</em> to the world. And not only so; but also, when He was sending them out, He sent them out two and two together, men with men; but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were not sent with them, and neither in the highway nor in the house did they associate with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> or with maidens: and thus they pleased God in everything. Also, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself was talking with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> by the well alone, <q>His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came</q> and found Him talking with her, <q>and wondered that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was standing and talking with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080500"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;4:27</a></span> Is He not a rule, such as may not be set aside, an example, and a pattern to all the tribes of men? And not only so; but also, when our Lord was risen from the place of the dead, and Mary came to the place of sepulture, she ran and fell at the feet of our Lord and worshipped Him, and would have taken hold of Him. But He said to her: <q>Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080501"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> Is it not, then, matter for astonishment, that, while our Lord did not allow Mary, the blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to touch His feet, yet <em>you</em> live with them, and are waited on by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and maidens, and sleep where they sleep, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wash your feet for you, and anoint you! Alas for this culpable state of mind! Alas for this state of mind which is destitute of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>! Alas for this affrontery and folly, which is without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God! Do you not judge your own self? Do you not examine your own self? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your own self and the measure of your strength? These things, moreover, are trustworthy, and these things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right; and these are rules immutable for those who behave themselves uprightly in our Lord. Many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, again, ministered to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of their substance, as the Shunammite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ministered to Elisha; but she did not live with him, but the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> lived in a house apart. And, when her son died, she wanted to throw herself at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; but his attendant would not allow her, but restrained her. But Elisha said to his servant: <q>Let her alone, because her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is distressed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080502"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse27">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:27</a></span> From these things, then, we ought to understand their manner of life. To <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> ministered of their substance: but they did not live with him; but chastely, and holily, and unblameably they behaved before the Lord, and finished their course, and received the crown in  our Lord God Almighty.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16. Exhortation to Union and to Obedience; Conclusion.</h3>

<p>Therefore, we beseech you, our brethren in our Lord, that these things be observed with you, as with us, and that we may be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that we may be one in you and you may be one in us, and that in everything we may be <em>of</em> one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and one heart in our Lord. Whosoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Lord hears us; and every one who is not of God hears not us. He who desires <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> hears us; and the virgin who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> desires to keep <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> hears us; but she who does not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> desire to keep <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> does not hear us. Finally, farewell in our Lord, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, all you <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be with you from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. So be it.</p>

<p> <em>Here</em> ends the Second Epistle of Clement, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Peter. His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be with us! So be it.</p>
