<h1>A Quo Primum</h1>  

<p><b>His Holiness Pope Benedict XIV</b>
<br><b>Encyclical on Judaism in Poland</b>
<br><b>June 14, 1751</b>

<p><i>To the Primate, Archbishops and Bishops, of the Kingdom of Poland.</i>

<p>Venerable Brothers, We give you Greeting and Our Apostolic Blessing.

<p>GOD IN HIS GOODNESS allowed Catholicism to take root in Poland at the
end of the tenth century during the reign of Our predecessor Leo VIII.
At the time, the efforts of King Mieszko and his Christian consort
Dobrava (Dlugosz, Annalium vestrorum Scriptorum, 2, 94) encouraged the
spread of Christianity. Since then pious and devout Poles have
continued the faithful practice of their new religion. During this
time various sects have attempted to establish themselves in Poland
and to spread the seeds of their errors, heresies, and evil opinions.
But the faithful Polish people have strongly withstood their efforts.

<p>We esteem the glorious memory of Polish martyrs, confessors, virgins
and holy men; their exemplary lives are recorded in the holy annals of
the Church. We also recall the many successful councils and synods
which gloriously defeated the Lutherans who tried tenaciously, using a
variety of methods, to establish a foothold and welcome in this
kingdom. At that time indeed the great council of Piotrkow met under
Our great predecessor and fellow citizen Gregory XIII, with prelate
Lippomano, bishop of Verona and Apostolic nuncio, as its president. To
the great glory of God it prohibited the principle of freedom of
conscience; adherents of this principle were seeking to introduce and
establish it in Poland. Another threat to Christians has been the
influence of Jewish faithlessness; this influence was strong because
Christians and Jews were living in the same cities and towns. However
their influence was minimized because the Polish bishops did all they
could to aid the Poles in their resistance to the Jews. What the
bishops did is recorded in the large tome which contains the
constitutions of the synods of the province of Gniezno. These facts
establish most clearly and plainly the great glory which the Polish
nation has won for its zeal in preserving the holy religion embraced
by its ancestors so many ages before.

<p>2. In regard to the matter of the Jews We must express our concern,
which causes Us to cry aloud: "the best color has been changed." Our
credible experts in Polish affairs and the citizens of Poland itself
who communicated with Us have informed Us that the number of Jews in
that country has greatly increased. In fact, some cities and towns
which had been predominantly Christian are now practically devoid of
Christians.

<p>The Jews have so replaced the Christians that some parishes are about
to lose their ministers because their revenue has dwindled so
drastically. Because the Jews control businesses selling liquor and
even wine, they are therefore allowed to supervise the collection of
public revenues. They have also gained control of inns, bankrupt
estates, villages and public land by means of which they have
subjugated poor Christian farmers. The Jews are cruel taskmasters, not
only working the farmers harshly and forcing them to carry excessive
loads, but also whipping them for punishment. So it has come about
that those poor farmers are the subjects of the Jews, submissive to
their will and power. Furthermore, although the power to punish lies
with the Christian official, he must comply with the commands of the
Jews and inflict the punishments they desire. If he doesn't, he would
lose his post. Therefore the tyrannical orders of the Jews have to be
carried out.

<p>3. In addition to the harm done to Christians in these regards, other
unreasonable matters can result in even greater loss and danger. The
most serious is that some households of the great have employed a Jew
as "Superintendent-of-the-Household"; in this capacity, they not only
administer domestic and economic matters, but they also ceaselessly
exhibit and flaunt authority over the Christians they are living with.
It is now even commonplace for Christians and Jews to intermingle
anywhere. But what is even less comprehensible is that Jews fearlessly
keep Christians of both sexes in their houses as their domestics,
bound to their service. Furthermore, by means of their particular
practice of commerce, they amass a great store of money and then by an
exorbitant rate of interest utterly destroy the wealth and inheritance
of Christians. Even if they borrow money from Christians at heavy and
undue interest with their synagogues as surety, it is obvious to
anyone who thinks about it that they do so to employ the money
borrowed from Christians in their commercial dealings; this enables
them to make enough profit to pay the agreed interest and
simultaneously increase their own store. At the same time, they gain
as many defenders of their synagogues and themselves as they have
creditors.

<p>4. The famous monk, Radulph, inspired long ago by an excess of zeal,
was so inflamed against the Jews that he traversed Germany and France
in the twelfth century and, by preaching against the Jews as the
enemies of our holy religion, incited Christians to destroy them. This
resulted in the deaths of a very large number of Jews. What must we
think his deeds or thoughts would be if he were now alive and saw what
was happening in Poland? But the great St. Bernard opposed this
immoderate and maddened zeal of Radulph, and wrote to the clergy and
people of eastern France:

<blockquote>
The Jews are not to be persecuted: they are
not to be slaughtered: they are not even to be driven out. Examine the
divine writings concerning them. We read in the psalm a new kind of
prophecy concerning the Jews: God has shown me, says the Church, on
the subject of my enemies, not to slay them in case they should ever
forget my people. Alive, however, they are eminent reminders for us of
the Lord's suffering. On this account they are scattered through all
lands in order that they may be witnesses to Our redemption while they
pay the just penalties for so great a crime. (Epistle 363)
</blockquote>

And he writes this to Henry, Archbishop of Mainz:

<blockquote>
Doesn't the Church every
day triumph more fully over the Jews in convicting or converting them
than if once and for all she destroyed them with the edge of the
sword: Surely it is not in vain that the Church has established the
universal prayer which is offered up for the faithless Jews from the
rising of the sun to its setting, that the Lord God may remove the
veil from their hearts, that they may be rescued from their darkness
into the light of truth. For unless it hoped that those who do not
believe would believe, it would obviously be futile and empty to pray
for them. (Epistle 365)
</blockquote>

5. Peter, abbot of Cluny, likewise wrote against Radulph to
<a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis</a> of France,
and urged him not to allow the destruction of the Jews. But
at the same time he encouraged him to punish their excesses and to
strip them of the property they had taken from Christians or had
acquired by
<a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>; he should then devote the value of this to the use
and benefit of holy religion, as may be seen in the Annals of
<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Venerable Cardinal Baronius</a> (1146).
In this matter, as in all others,
We adopt the same norm of action as did the Roman Pontiffs who were
Our venerable predecessors.
<a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> forbade Christians under
heavy penalties to accept permanent domestic service under Jews. "Let
them not continually devote themselves to the service of Jews for a
wage." He sets out the reason for this in the decretal. "Because
Jewish ways do not harmonize in any way with ours and they could
easily turn the minds of the simple to their own superstitions and
faithlessness through continual intercourse and unceasing
acquaintance." Innocent III, after saying that Jews were being
received by Christians into their cities, warns that the method and
condition of this reception should guard against their repaying the
benefit with evildoing. "They on being admitted to our acquaintance in
a spirit of mercy, repay us, the popular proverb says, as the mouse in
the wallet, the snake in the lap and fire in the bosom usually repay
their host." The same Pope stated that it was fitting for Jews to
serve Christians rather than vice versa and added: "Let not the sons
of the free woman be servants of the sons of the handmaid; but as
servants rejected by their lord for whose death they evilly conspired,
let them realize that the result of this deed is to make them servants
of those whom Christ's death made free," as we read in his decretal.
Likewise in the decretal under the same heading, he forbids the
promotion of Jews to public office: "forbidding Jews to be promoted to
public offices since in such circumstances they may be very dangerous
to Christians." Innocent IV, also, in writing to
<a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">St. Louis</a>, King of
France, who intended to drive the Jews beyond the boundaries of his
kingdom, approves of this plan since the Jews gave very little heed to
the regulations made by the Apostolic See in their regard: "Since We
strive with all Our heart for the salvation of souls, We grant you
full power by the authority of this letter to expel the Jews,
particularly since We have learned that they do not obey the said
statutes issued by this See against them" (Raynaldus, Annals, A.D.
1253, no. 34).

<p>6. But if it is asked what matters the Apostolic See forbids to Jews
living in the same cities as Christians, We will say that all those
activities which are now allowed in Poland are forbidden; these We
recounted above. There is no need of much reading to understand that
this is the clear truth of the matter. It is enough to peruse
decretals with the heading ; the constitutions of Our predecessors,
the Roman Pontiffs Nicholas IV, Paul IV, St. Pius V, Gregory XIII and
Clement VIII are readily available in the Roman Bullarium. To
understand these matters most clearly, Venerable Brothers, you do not
even need to read those. You will recall the statutes and prescripts
of the synods of your predecessors; they always entered in their
constitutions every measure concerning the Jews which was sanctioned
and ordained by the Roman Pontiffs.

<p>7. The essence of the difficulty, however, is that either the
sanctions of the synods are forgotten or they are not put into effect.
To you then, Venerable Brothers, passes the task of renewing those
sanctions. The nature of your office requires that you carefully
encourage their implementation. In this matter begin with the clergy,
as is fair and reasonable. These will have to show others the right
way to act, and light the way for the rest by their example. For in
God's mercy, We hope that the good example of the clergy will lead the
straying laity back to the straight path. You will be able to give
these orders and commands easily and confidently, in that neither your
property nor your privileges are hired to Jews; furthermore you do no
business with them and you neither lend them money nor borrow from
them. Thus, you will be free from and unaffected by all dealings with
them.

<p>8. The sacred canons, prescribe that in the most important cases, such
as the present, censures should be imposed upon the recalcitrant; and
that those cases which bode danger and ruin to religion should be
reckoned as reserved cases in which only the bishop can give
absolution. The Council of Trent considered your jurisdiction when it
affirmed your right to reserve cases. It did not restrict such cases
to public crimes only, but extended them to include more notorious and
serious cases, provided they were not purely internal. But we have
often said that some cases should be considered more notorious and
serious. These are cases, to which men are more prone, which are a
danger both to ecclesiastical discipline and to the salvation of the
souls which have been entrusted to your episcopal care. We have
discussed these at length in Our treatise, Book 5, 5.

<p>9. In this matter We will help as much as possible. If you have to
proceed against ecclesiastics exempt from your jurisdiction, you will
doubtless encounter additional difficulties. Therefore We are giving
Our Venerable Brother Archbishop Nicaenus, Our Nuncio there, a mandate
appropriate for this business, in order that he may supply for you the
necessary means from the powers entrusted to him. At the same time We
promise you that when the situation arises, We will cooperate
energetically and effectively with those whose combined authority and
power are appropriate to remove this stain of shame from Poland. But
first Venerable Brothers, ask aid from God, the source of all things.
From Him beg help for Us and this Apostolic See. And while We embrace
you in the fullness of charity, We lovingly impart to you, Our
brothers, and to the flocks entrusted to your care, Our Apostolic
Blessing.

<p>Given at Castelgandolfo on the 14th of June 1751 in the eleventh year
of Our Pontificate.
