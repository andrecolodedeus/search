<h1>Ad Extremas</h1>  
<p><b>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII</b>
<br><b>On Seminaries for Native Clergy</b>
<br><b>June 24, 1893</b>

<p>Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII promulgated on June 24, 1893.

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brothers, the Patriarchs, Archbishops and Bishops and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Holy See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brothers, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>The Orient, courageously and successfully explored by the Portuguese, is
coveted by many today for its lucrative trade. We, however, have a more
noble purpose in mind. We reflect upon those immense regions of the Indies
where for many centuries men of the Gospel have expended their labor. Our
thoughts turn first of all to the blessed Apostle Thomas who is rightly
called the founder of preaching the Gospel to the Hindus. Then, there is
Francis Xavier, who long afterwards dedicated himself zealously to the same
praiseworthy calling. Through his extraordinary perseverance, he converted
hundreds of thousands of Hindus from the myths and vile superstitions of
the Brahmans to the true religion. In the footsteps of this holy man
followed numerous priests, secular and religious, who with the authority
and permission of the Holy See strove untiringly to preserve and promote
the Christian mysteries and institutions introduced by Thomas and renewed
by Xavier. To this day, they are continuing these noble efforts;
nevertheless, in the vast reaches of the earth, many are still deprived of
the truth, miserably imprisoned in the darkness of superstition! How very
great a field, especially in the north, lies yet uncultivated to receive
the seed of the Gospel!

<p>2. Pondering these needs, We place our trust in Our Savior who alone knows
the exact circumstance and time to bestow his light; he is wont to direct
the mind and hearts of men by divine inspiration. But, assuredly, We ought
to exert every possible effort to convert such a great part of the world.
We have been searching for possible ways of better organizing and expanding
Christianity in the East Indies, we have decided upon certain measures to
help achieve Our goal.

<p>3. First of all, to be sure, with respect to the "patronato" of the
Portuguese people in the East Indies, We have concluded a formal pact with
the most faithful king of Portugal and Algerve. This agreement has removed
the causes of dissensions, which had disrupted Christians for so long a
time. These communities have been under obedience to apostolic vicars and
prefects. We have decided to form them into dioceses with their own bishops
to be administered by ordinary right. Therefore, by the apostolic letter,
"Humanae salutis," given on the first of September, 1886, a new hierarchy
has been instituted in those regions, consisting of eight church provinces,
namely, Goa as the patriarchal see, Agra, Bombay, Verapoly, Calcutta,
Madras, Pondichery and Colombo. Furthermore, through the Congregation of
the Propagation of the Faith, We will do whatever will be fruitful there
for salvation and for the increase of faith and piety.

<p>4. The preservation of the Christian faith among the Hindus will be
precarious and its propagation uncertain as long as there is not a native
clergy properly trained for priestly duties, not only to be of assistance
to foreign priests, but also to be in rightful charge of the administration
of the Christian Church in their cities. Tradition tells us that Frances
Xavier maintained this same opinion. They say that he used to assert that
the Christian cause in India could never have firm roots without the
continuing dedication of a pious and zealous clergy native to India. It is
clearly evident that he had a keen understanding of the issue. Certainly
the work of the missionaries coming from Europe is beset with many
obstacles. Most especially, indeed, is their unfamiliarity with the
vernacular, which is very difficult to learn. There is also the remoteness
of institutions and customs which remain unfamiliar even after a long
period of time. Hence, the European clergy is forced to live there as in a
strange land. Since a foreign clergy, therefore, has difficulty in winning
the hearts of the people, it is plain that the work of a native clergy
would be far more fruitful. From experience, they know the nature and
customs of their people; they know when to speak and when to keep silent.
In fine, they live among Hindus as Hindus without causing any suspicion and
it is, indeed, difficult to say how important this is especially in times
of crisis.

<p>5. Then, again, it is necessary to realize that the number of missionaries
abroad is far from adequate to serve the existing Christian communities.
This deficiency is plainly evident from the mission statistics. The
missionaries in India keep on imploring the Sacred Congregation for more
preachers of the Gospel. Now, if there are not enough foreign priests to
care for souls, what will happen in the future when the number of
Christians will have multiplied? Nor, indeed, is there any reason to hope
that the number of missionaries will increase proportionately.
Consequently, if we want to be concerned for the salvation of India and the
establishment of Christianity in that immense region on a firm foundation,
we will have to select candidates from the native people, who after careful
training will assume priestly functions and duties.

<p>6. Thirdly, we must not overlook an eventuality, even though at the present
time it is improbable. Such critical conditions could arise in Europe or
Asia that would compel foreign priests to leave the Indies. In that event,
how could religion survive without a native clergy: with no one to
administer the sacraments, no one to teach the law of God? The history of
the Chinese, Japanese, and Ethiopians speaks clearly enough about this
hazard. More than once, the Christians in Japan and China had to suffer
from hatred and calamity. The hostile people in power exiled and executed
alien priests, but spared the native. Because they were completely familiar
with the language and customs of their native land and were sustained by
friends and relatives, they were allowed not only to remain unharmed in
their country, but also to administer the sacraments freely, and perform
pastoral duties in all the provinces. On the contrary, the Ethiopia, where
Christians already numbered 200,000, a sudden storm of persecution
completely destroyed the fruits of long labor because there was no native
clergy when the European missionaries were killed or expelled.

<p>7. Finally, there must be respect for antiquity; whatever we see
advantageously established in times past must be religiously preserved.
Now, it was the practice of the Apostles first to instruct the multitude in
Christian precepts, then to select several from the people and initiate
them into the sacred mysteries and even elevate them to the episcopacy.
This example was followed afterwards by the Roman pontiffs. Their custom
has always been to direct missionaries to exert every means to select a
native clergy wherever the Christian community grew sufficiently large. To
take care, therefore, of the preservation and propagation of the Catholic
religion among the Hindus, a Hindu clergy has to be formed that could
administer the sacraments and govern the Christian people properly, no
matter how menacing the times.

<p>8. For that reason, the prefects of the Congregation of the Indies, with
the advice and approval of the Holy See, have founded seminaries for
priests wherever possible. The Synods, moreover, of Colombo, Bangalore and
Allahabad, held at the beginning of 1887, have decreed that every diocese
should have its own seminary for the training of a native clergy; if any of
the suffragan bishops do not have the financial means to do so, they are to
have their seminarians trained in the metropolitan seminary at their own
expense. The bishops are making every effort to implement these beneficial
decrees, but their most admirable willingness is hindered by lack of funds
and by the want of qualified priests to supervise instruction and direct
discipline judiciously. Hence, there are hardly any seminaries where
candidates are able to complete a prescribed course of studies--and this is
at a time when the civil government and Protestants, in large numbers, are
sparing no expense nor effort to offer young men a judicious and refined
education.

<p>9. It is evident, therefore, how opportune it is and how consistent with
the public good to erect in the East Indies some seminaries where the
native youth, the hope of the Church, are educated in all the refinements
of doctrine and also in those virtues essential for the pious and wholesome
exercise of sacred functions. As the reasons for dissensions have been
removed by the pact agreed upon, and as the diocesan administration had
been erected by the hierarchy of the Church, we would seem to have attained
our goals if we could provide a sound basis for the training of the clergy.
For, as We have said, once seminaries for the clergy have been founded,
qualified priests in great numbers would come forth, and in spreading the
truth of the Gospel, would skillfully utilize the important resources of
their studies.

<p>10. For such a noble and beneficial work, it is fitting that Europeans make
some financial contribution, especially because We alone are not able to
manage the vast cost of such an enterprise. It is the mark of Christians to
cherish all mankind as brothers wherever they are, and to exclude no one
from their love, particularly in matters upon which the eternal salvation
of their neighbor depends. We, therefore, earnestly request that you will
fully support our undertaking. Be sure that the role of Christianity in
such remote regions becomes well known. Make your people understand that
something must be done for the Hindus. May they who believe that works of
mercy are the most perfect investment especially realize this need.

<p>11. We are convinced that we have not appealed in vain to the generosity of
your people. If the contributions should exceed the expenditures for the
seminaries which we have mentioned above, we shall take care that the
remaining funds will be used beneficially and conscientiously on other
projects.

<p>12. In token of heavenly favors, and as a witness of Our good will, most
lovingly in the Lord, We bestow upon you, venerable brothers, upon your
clergy and your people the Apostolic Blessing.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, on the 24th day of June, in the year 1893,
the sixteenth year of Our pontificate.
