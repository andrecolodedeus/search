<h1>Address to the United Nations General Assembly</h1>  
<p><b>His Holiness Pope John Paul II (October 2, 1979)</b>

<p>Mr. President:

<p>I DESIRE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE to the General Assembly of the United
Nations, which I am permitted today to participate in and to address.
My thanks go in the first place to the secretary general of the United
Nations organization, Dr. Kurt Waldheim. Last autumn, soon after my
election to the Chair of St. Peter, he invited me to make this visit,
and he renewed his invitation in the course of our meeting in Rome
last May. From the first moment I felt greatly honored and deeply
obliged. And today, before this distinguished assembly, I also thank
you, Mr. President, who have so kindly welcomed me and invited me to
speak.

<p>The formal reason for my intervention today is, without any question,
the special bond of cooperation that links the Apostolic See with the
United Nations organization, as is shown by the presence of the Holy
See's permanent observer to this organization. The existence of this
bond, which is held in high esteem by the Holy See, rests on the
sovereignty with which the Apostolic See has been endowed for many
centuries. The territorial extent of that sovereignty is limited to
the small state of Vatican City, but the sovereignty itself is
warranted by the need of the papacy to exercise its mission in full
freedom and to be able to deal with any interlocutor, whether a
government or an international organization, without dependence on
other sovereignties. Of course the nature and aims of the spiritual
mission of the Apostolic See and the Church make their participation
in the tasks and activities of the United Nations very different from
that of the states, which are communities in the political and
temporal sense.

<p>Besides attaching great importance to its collaboration with the
United Nations organization, the Apostolic See has always since the
foundation of your organization, expressed its esteem and its
agreement with the historic significance of this supreme forum for the
international life of humanity today. It also never ceases to support
your organization's functions and initiatives, which are aimed at
peaceful coexistence and collaboration between nations. There are many
proofs of this. In the more than 30 years of the existence of the
United Nations, it has received much attention in papal messages and
encyclicals, in documents of the Catholic episcopate and likewise in
the Second Vatican Council. Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI looked
with confidence on your important institution as an eloquent and
promising sign of our times. He who is now addressing you has, since
the first months of his pontificate, several times expressed the same
confidence and conviction as his predecessors.

<p>This confidence and conviction on the part of the Apostolic See are
the result, as I have said, not of merely political reasons but of the
religious and moral character of the mission of the Roman Catholic
Church. As a universal community embracing faithful belonging to
almost all countries and continents, nations, peoples, races,
languages and cultures, the Church is deeply interested in the
existence and activity of the organization whose very name tells us
that it unites and associates nations and states. It unites and
associates, it does not divide and oppose. It seeks out the ways for
understanding and peaceful collaboration, and endeavors with the means
at its disposal and the methods in its power to exclude war, division
and mutual destruction within the great family of humanity today.

<p>This is the real reason, the essential reason, for my presence among
you, and I wish to thank this distinguished assembly for giving
consideration to this reason, which can make my presence among you in
some way useful. It is certainly a highly significant fact that among
you in the representatives of the states, whose raison d'etre is the
sovereignty of powers linked with territory and people, there is also
today the representative of the Apostolic See and the Catholic Church.
This Church is the Church of Jesus Christ who declared before the
tribunal of the Roman judge, Pilate, that he was a king, but with a
kingdom not of this world (cf. Jn. 18:36-37). When he was then asked
about the reason for the existence of his kingdom among men. he
explained: "For this I was born, and for this I have come into the
world, to bear witness to the truth" (Jn. 18:37). Here, before the
representatives of the states, I wish not only to thank you but also
to offer my special congratulations, since the invitation extended to
the pope to speak in your assembly shows that the United Nations
accepts and respects the religious and moral dimension of those human
problems that it is her duty to bring to the world. The questions that
concern your functions and receive your attention -- as is indicated
by the vast organic complex of institutions and activities that are
part of or collaborate with the United Nations, especially in the
fields of culture, health, food, labor and the peaceful uses of
nuclear energy -- certainly make it essential for us to meet in the
name of man in his wholeness, in all the fullness and manifold riches
of his spiritual and material existence, as I have stated in my
encyclical <i>Redemptor Hominis,</i> the first of my pontificate.

<p>Now, availing myself of the solemn occasion of my meeting with the
representatives of the nations of the earth, I wish above all to send
my greetings to all the men and women living on this planet. To every
man and every woman, without any exception whatever every human being
living on earth is a member of a civil society, of a nation, many of
them represented here. Each one of you, distinguished ladies and
gentlemen, represents a particular state, system and political
structure, but what you represent above all are individual human
beings; you are all representatives of men and women, of practically
all the people of the world, individual men and women, communities and
peoples who are living the present phase of their own history and who
are also part of the history of humanity as a whole, each of them a
subject endowed with dignity as a human person with his or her own
culture, experiences and aspirations, tensions and sufferings, and
legitimate expectations. This relationship is what provides the reason
for all political activity, whether national or international, for in
the final analysis this activity comes from man, is exercised by man
and is for man. And if political activity is cut off from this
fundamental relationship and finality, if it becomes in a way its own
end, it loses much of its reason to exist. Even more, it can also give
rise to a specific alienation; it can become extraneous to man; it can
come to contradict humanity itself. In reality, what justifies the
existence of any political activity is service to man, concerned and
responsible attention to the essential problems and duties of his
earthly existence in its social dimension and significance, on which
also the good of each person depends.

<p>I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to excuse me for speaking of
questions that are certainly self-evident for you. But it does not
seem pointless to speak of them, since the most frequent pitfall for
human activities is the possibility of losing sight, while performing
them, of the clearest truths, the most elementary principles.

<p>I would like to express the wish that, in view of its universal
character, the United Nations will never cease to be the forum, the
high tribune, from which all man's problems are appraised in truth and
justice. It was in the name of this inspiration, it was through this
historic stimulus, that on June 26, 1945, toward the end of the
terrible World War II, the charter of the United Nations was signed
and on the following Oct. 24, your organization began its life. Soon
after, on Dec. 10, 1948, came its fundamental document, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the rights of the human being as a
concrete individual and of the human being in his universal value.
This document is a milestone on the long and difficult path of the
human race. The progress of humanity must be measured not only by the
progress of science and technology, which shows man's uniqueness with
regard to nature, but also and chiefly by the primacy given to
spiritual values and by the progress of moral life. In this field is
manifested the full dominion of reason, through truth, in the behavior
of the individual and of society, and also the control of reason over
nature; and thus human conscience quietly triumphs, as was expressed
in the ancient saying, "Genus humanum arte et ratione vivit."

<p>It was when technology was being directed in its one-sided progress
toward goals of war, hegemony and conquest, so that man might kill man
and nation destroy nation by depriving it of its liberty and the right
to exist -- and I still have before my mind the image of World War II
in Europe, which began 40 years ago on Sept. 1, 1939, with the
invasion of Poland and ended on May 9, 1945 -- it was precisely then
that the United Nations arose. And three years later the document
appeared which, as I have said, must be considered a real milestone on
the path of the moral progress of humanity -- the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. The governments and states of the world
have understood that, if they are not to attack and destroy each
other, they must unite. The real way, the fundamental way to this is
through each human being, through the definition and recognition of
and respect for the inalienable rights of individuals and of the
communities of peoples.

<p>Today, 40 years after the outbreak of World War II, I wish to recall
the whole of the experiences by individuals and nations that were
sustained by a generation that is largely still alive. I had occasion
not long ago to reflect again on some of those experiences, in one of
the places that are most distressing and overflowing with contempt for
man and his fundamental rights -- the extermination camp of Oswiecim
(Auschwitz), which I visited during my pilgrimage to Poland last June.
This infamous place is unfortunately only one of the many scattered
over the continent of Europe. But the memory of even one should be a
warning sign on the path of humanity today, in order that every kind
of concentration camp anywhere on earth may once and for all be done
away with. And everything that recalls those horrible experiences
should also disappear forever from the lives of nations and states,
everything that is a continuation of those experiences under different
forms, namely the various kinds of torture and oppression, either
physical or moral, carried out under any system, in any land; this
phenomenon is all the more distressing if it occurs under the pretext
of internal security or the need to preserve an apparent peace.

<p>You will forgive me, ladies and gentlemen, for evoking this memory.
But I would be untrue to the history of this century, I would be
dishonest with regard to the great cause of man, which we all wish to
serve, if I should keep silent, I who come from the country on whose
living body Oswiecim was at one time constructed. But my purpose in
invoking this memory is above all to show what painful experiences and
sufferings by millions of people gave rise to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which has been placed as the basic
inspiration and cornerstone of the United Nations organization. This
declaration was paid for by millions of our brothers and sisters at
the cost of their suffering and sacrifice, brought about by the
brutalization that darkened and made insensitive the human consciences
of their oppressors and of those who carried out a real genocide. This
price cannot have been paid in vain! The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights -- with its train of many declarations and conventions on
highly important aspects of human rights, in favor of children, of
women, of equality between races, and especially the two international
covenants on economic; social and cultural rights and on civil and
political rights -- must remain the basic value in the United Nations
with which the consciences of its members must be confronted and from
which they must draw continual inspiration. If the truths and
principles contained in this document were to be forgotten or ignored
and were thus to lose the genuine self evidence that distinguished
them at the time they were brought painfully to birth, then the noble
purpose of the United Nations could be faced with the threat of a new
destruction. This is what would happen if the simple yet powerful
eloquence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were decisively
subjugated by what is wrongly called political interest, but often
really means no more than one sided gain and advantage to the
detriment of others, or a thirst for power regardless of the needs of
others -- everything which by its nature is opposed to the spirit of
the declaration. Political interest understood in this sense, if you
will pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, dishonors the noble and
difficult mission of your service for the good of your countries and
of all humanity.

<p>Fourteen years ago my great predecessor Pope Paul VI spoke from this
podium. He spoke memorable words, which I desire to repeat today: "No
more war, war never again! Never one against the other," or even
"one above the other," but always, on every occasion, "with each
other."

<p>Paul VI was a tireless servant of the cause of peace. I wish to follow
him with all my strength and continue his service. The Catholic Church
in every place on earth proclaims a message of peace, prays for peace,
educates for peace. This purpose is also shared by the representatives
and followers of other churches and communities and of other religions
of the world, and they have pledged themselves to it. In union with
efforts by all people of good will, this work is certainly bearing
fruit. Nevertheless we are continually troubled by the armed conflicts
that break out from time to time. How grateful we are to the Lord when
a direct intervention succeeds in avoiding such a conflict, as in the
case of the tension that last year threatened Argentina and Chile.

<p>It is my fervent hope that a solution also to the Middle East crises
may draw nearer. While being prepared to recognize the value of any
concrete step or attempt made to settle the conflict, I want to recall
that it would have no value if it did not truly represent the first
stone of a general overall peace in the area, a peace that, being
necessarily based on equitable recognition of the rights of all,
cannot fail to include the consideration and just settlement of the
Palestinian question. Connected with this question is that of the
tranquility, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon within
the formula that has made it an example of peaceful and mutually
fruitful coexistence between distinct communities, a formula that I
hope will, in the common interest, be maintained, with the adjustments
required by the developments of the situation. I also hope for a
special statute that, under international guarantees -- as my
predecessor Paul VI indicated -- would respect the particular nature
of Jerusalem, a heritage sacred to the veneration of millions of
believers of the three great monotheistic religions, Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.

<p>We are troubled also by reports of the development of weaponry
exceeding in quality and size the means of war and destruction ever
known before. In this field also we applaud the decisions and
agreements aimed at reducing the arms race. Nevertheless, the life of
humanity today is seriously endangered by the threat of destruction
and by the risk arising even from accepting certain tranquilizing
reports. And the resistance to actual concrete proposals of real
disarmament, such as those called for by this assembly in a special
session last year, shows that together with the will for peace that
all profess and that most desire there is also in existence -- perhaps
in latent or conditional form but nonetheless real -- the contrary and
the negation of this will. The continual preparations for war
demonstrated by the production of ever more numerous, powerful and
sophisticated weapons in various countries show that there is a desire
to be ready for war, andbeing ready means being able to start it; it
also means taking the risk that sometime, somewhere, somehow, someone
can set in motion the terrible mechanism of general destruction.

<p>It is therefore necessary to make a continuing and even more energetic
effort to do away with the very possibility of provoking war, and to
make such catastrophes impossible by influencing the attitudes and
convictions, the very intentions and aspirations of governments and
peoples. This duty, kept constantly in mind by the United Nations and
each of its institutions, must also be a duty for every society, every
regime, every government. This task is certainly served by initiatives
aimed at international cooperation for the fostering of development.
As Paul VI said at the end of his encyclical <i>Populorum Progressio</i>,
"If the new name for peace is development, who would not wish to
labor for it with all his powers?" However, this task must also be
served by constant reflection and activity aimed at discovering the
very roots of hatred, destructiveness and contempt -- the roots of
everything that produces the temptation to war, not so much in the
hearts of the nations as in the inner determination of the systems
that decide the history of whole societies. In this titanic labor of
building up the peaceful future of our planet the United Nations has
undoubtedly a key function and guiding role, for which it must refer
to the just ideals contained in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. For this declaration has struck a real blow against the many
deep roots of war, since the spirit of war, in its basic primordial
meaning, springs up and grows to maturity where the inalienable rights
of man are violated.

<p>This is a new and deeply relevant vision of the cause of peace, one
that goes deeper and is more radical. It is a vision that sees the
genesis, and in a sense the substance, of war in the more complex
forms emanating from injustice viewed in all its various aspects; this
injustice first attacks human rights and thereby destroys the organic
unity of the social order and it then affects the whole system of
international relations. Within the Church's doctrine, the encyclical
<i>Pacem in Terris</i> by John XXIII provides in synthetic form a view of
this matter that is very close to the ideological foundation of the
United Nations. This must therefore form the basis to which one must
loyally and perseveringly adhere in order to establish true peace on
earth.

<p>By applying this criterion we must diligently examine which principal
tensions in connection with the inalienable rights of man can weaken
the construction of this peace which we all desire so ardently and
which is the essential goal of the efforts of the United Nations. It
is not easy, but it must be done. Anyone who undertakes it must take
up a totally objective position and be guided by sincerity, readiness
to acknowledge one's prejudices and mistakes and readiness even to
renounce one's own particular interests, including any of these
interests. It is by sacrificing these interests for the sake of peace
that we serve them best. After all, in whose political interest can it
ever be to have another war?

<p>Every analysis must necessarily start from the premise that --
although each person lives in a particular concrete social and
historical context -- every human being is endowed with a dignity that
must never be lessened, impaired or destroyed but must instead be
respected and safeguarded. if peace is really to be built up.

<p>In a movement that one hopes will be progressive and continuous, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other international and
national juridical instruments are endeavoring to create general
awareness of the dignity of the human being, and to define at least
some of the inalienable rights of man. Permit me to enumerate some of
the most important human rights that are universally recognized: the
right to life, liberty and security of person; the right to food,
clothing, housing, sufficient health care, rest and leisure; the right
to freedom of expression, education and culture; the right to manifest
one's religion either individually or in community, in public or in
private; the right to choose a state of life, to found a family and to
enjoy all conditions necessary for family life; the right to property
and work, to adequate working conditions and a just wage; the right of
assembly and association; the right to freedom of movement, to
internal and external migration; the right to nationality and
residence; the right to political participation and the right to
participate in the free choice of the political system of the people
to which one belongs. All these human rights taken together are in
keeping with the substance of the dignity of the human being,
understood in his entirety, not as reduced to one dimension only.
These rights concern the satisfaction of man's essential needs, the
exercise of his freedoms and his relationships with others; but always
and everywhere they concern man, they concern man's full human
dimension.

<p>Man lives at the same time both in the world of material values and in
that of spiritual values. For the individual living and hoping man,
his needs, freedoms and relationships with others never concern one
sphere of values alone, but belong to both. Material and spiritual
realities may be viewed separately in order to understand better that
in the concrete human being they are inseparable, and to see that any
threat to human rights, whether in the field of material realities or
in that of spiritual realities, is equally dangerous for peace, since
in every instance it concerns man in his entirety. Permit me,
distinguished ladies and gentlemen, to recall a constant rule of the
history of humanity, a rule that is implicitly contained in all that I
have already stated with regard to integral development and human
rights. The rule is based on the relationship between spiritual values
and material or economic values. In this relationship, it is the
spiritual values that are preeminent, both on account of the nature
of these values and also for reasons concerning the good of man. The
pre eminence of the values of the spirit defines the proper sense of
earthly material goods and the way to use them. This pre eminence is
therefore at the basis of a just peace. It is also a contributing
factor to ensuring that material development, technical development
and the development of civilization are at the service of what
constitutes man. This means enabling man to have full access to truth,
to moral development, and to the complete possibility of enjoying the
goods of culture which he has inherited, and of increasing them by his
own creativity. It is easy to see that material goods do not have
unlimited capacity for satisfying the needs of man: They are not in
themselves easily distributed and, in the relationship between those
who possess and enjoy them and those who are without them, they give
rise to tension, dissension and division that will often even turn
into open conflict. Spiritual goods, on the other hand, are open to
unlimited enjoyment by many at the same time, without diminution of
the goods themselves. Indeed, the more people share in such goods, the
more they are enjoyed and drawn upon, the more then do those goods
show their in destructible and immortal worth. This truth is
confirmed, for example, by the works of creativity -- I mean by the
works of thought, poetry, music, and the figurative arts, fruits of
man's spirit.

<p>A critical analysis of our modern civilization shows that in the last
hundred years it has contributed as never before to the development of
material goods, but that it has also given rise, both in theory and
still more in practice, to a series of attitudes in which sensitivity
to the spiritual dimension of human existence is diminished to a
greater or less extent, as a result of certain premises which reduce
the meaning of human life chiefly to the many different material and
economic factors -- I mean to the demands of production, the market,
consumption, the accumulation of riches or of the growing bureaucracy
with which an attempt is made to regulate these very processes. Is
this not the result of having subordinated man to one single
conception and sphere of values?

<p>What is the link between these reflections and the cause of peace and
war? Since, as I have already stated, material goods by their very
nature provoke conditionings and divisions, the struggle to obtain
these goods becomes inevitable in the history of humanity. If we
cultivate this one-sided subordination of man to material goods alone,
we shall be incapable of overcoming this state of need. We shall be
able to attenuate it and avoid it in particular cases, but we shall
not succeed in eliminating it systematically and radically, unless we
emphasize more and pay greater honor, before everyone's eyes, in the
sight of every society, to the second dimension of the goods of man:
the dimension that does not divide people but puts them into
communication with each other, associates them and unites them.

<p>I consider that the famous opening words of the Charter of the United
Nations, in which the peoples of the United Nations, determined to
save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, solemnly
reaffirmed "faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and
worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of
nations large and small," are meant to stress this dimension.

<p>Indeed, the fight against incipient wars cannot be carried out on a
merely superficial level, by treating the symptoms. It must be done in
a radical way, by attacking the causes. The reason I have called
attention to the dimension constituted by spiritual realities is my
concern for the cause of peace, peace which is built up by men and
women uniting around what is most fully and profoundly human, around
what raises them above the world about them and determines their
indestructible grandeur -- indestructible in spite of the death to
which everyone on earth is subject. I would like to add that the
Catholic Church, and I think I can say, the whole of Christianity sees
in this very domain its own particular task. The Second Vatican
Council helped to establish what the Christian faith has in common
with the various non-Christian religions in this aspiration. The
Church is therefore grateful to all who show respect and good will
with regard to this mission of hers and do not impede it or make it
difficult. An analysis of the history of mankind, especially at its
recent stage, shows how important is the duty of revealing more fully
the range of the goods that are linked with the spiritual dimension of
human existence. It shows how important this task is for building
peace and how serious is any threat to human rights. Any violation of
them, even in a peace situation, is a form of warfare against
humanity.

<p>It seems that in the modern world there are two main threats. Both
concern human rights in the field of international relations and human
rights within the individual states or societies.

<p>The first of these systematic threats against human rights is linked
in an overall sense with the distribution of material goods. This
distribution is frequently unjust both within individual societies and
on the planet as a whole. Everyone knows that these goods are given to
man not only as nature's bounty; they are enjoyed by him chiefly as
the fruit of his many activities, ranging from the simplest manual and
physical labor to the most complicated forms of industrial production
and highly qualified and specialized research and study. Various forms
of inequality in the possession of material goods, and in the
enjoyment of them, can often be explained by different historical and
cultural causes and circumstances. But, while these circumstances can
diminish the moral responsibility of people today, they do not prevent
the situations of inequality from being marked by injustice and social
injury.

<p>People must become aware that economic tensions within countries and
in the relationship between states and even between entire continents
contain within themselves substantial elements that restrict or
violate human rights . Such elements are the exploitation of labor and
many other abuses that affect the dignity of the human person. It
follows that the fundamental criterion for comparing social, economic
and political systems is not, and cannot be, the criterion of hegemony
and imperialism; it can be, and indeed it must be, the humanistic
criterion, namely the measure in which each system is really capable
of reducing, restraining and eliminating as far as possible the
various forms of exploitation of man and of ensuring for him through
work, not only the just distribution of the indispensable material
goods, but also a participation, in keeping with his dignity, in the
whole process of production and in the social life that grows up
around that process. Let us not forget that, although man depends on
the resources of the material world for his life, he cannot be their
slave, but he must be their master. The words of the book of Genesis.
"Fill the earth and subdue it" (Gn. 1:28), are in a sense a primary
and essential directive in the field of economy and of labor policy.

<p>Humanity as a whole, and the individual nations, have certainly made
remarkable progress in this field during the last hundred years. But
it is a field in which there is never any lack of systematic threats
and violations of human rights. Disturbing factors are frequently
present in the form of the frightful disparities between excessively
rich individuals and groups on the one hand, and on the other hand the
majority made up of the poor or indeed of the destitute, who lack food
and opportunities for work and education and are in great numbers
condemned to hunger and disease. And concern is also caused at times
by the radical separation of work from property, by man's indifference
to the production enterprise to which he is linked only by a work
obligation, without feeling that he is working for a good that will be
his or for himself. It is no secret that the abyss separating the
minority of the excessively rich from the multitude of the destitute
is a very grave symptom in the life of any society. This must also be
said with even greater insistence with regard to the abyss separating
countries and regions of the earth. Surely the only way to overcome
this serious disparity between areas of satiety and areas of hunger
and depression is through coordinated cooperation by all countries.
This requires above all else a unity inspired by an authentic
perspective of peace. Everything will depend on whether these
differences and contrasts in the sphere of the possession of goods
will be systematically reduced through truly effective means, on
whether the belts of hunger, malnutrition, destitution,
underdevelopment, disease and illiteracy will disappear from the
economic map of the earth, and on whether peaceful cooperation will
avoid imposing conditions of exploitation and economic or political
dependence, which would only be a form of neocolonialism.

<p>I would now like to draw attention to a second systematic threat to
man in his inalienable rights in the modern world, a threat which
constitutes no less a danger than the first to the cause of peace I
refer to the various forms of injustice in the field of the spirit.

<p>Man can indeed be wounded in his inner relationship with truth, in his
conscience, in his most personal belief, in his view of the world, in
his religious faith, and in the sphere of what are known as civil
liberties. Decisive for these last is equality of rights without
discrimination on grounds of origin, race, sex, nationality, religion,
political convictions and the like. Equality of rights means the
exclusion of the various forms of privilege for some and
discrimination against others, whether they are people born in the
same country or people from different backgrounds of history,
nationality, race and ideology. For centuries the thrust of
civilization has been in one direction: that of giving the life of
individual political societies a form in which there can be fully
safeguarded the objective rights of the spirit, of human conscience
and of human creativity, including man's relationship with God. Yet in
spite of this we still see in this field recurring threats and
violations, often with no possibility of appealing to a higher
authority or of obtaining an effective remedy.

<p>Besides the acceptance of legal formulas safeguarding the principle of
the freedom of the human spirit, such as freedom of thought and
expression, religious freedom and freedom of conscience, structures of
social life often exist in which the practical exercise of these
freedoms condemns man, in fact if not formally, to become a
second class or third class citizen, to see compromised his chances of
social advancement, his professional career or his access to certain
posts of responsibility, and to lose even the possibility of educating
his children freely It is a question of the highest importance that in
internal social life, as well as in international life, all human
beings in every nation and country should be able to enjoy effectively
their full rights under any political regime or system.

<p>Only the safeguarding of this real completeness of rights for every
human being without discrimination can ensure peace at its very roots.

<p>With regard to religious freedom, which I as pope am bound to have
particularly at heart, precisely with a view to safeguarding peace, I
would like to repeat here, as a contribution to respect for man's
spiritual dimension, some principles contained in the Second Vatican
Council's declaration <i>Dignitatis Humanae</i>. "In accordance with
their dignity, all human beings, because they are persons, that is,
beings endowed with reason and free will and therefore bearing
personal responsibility, are both impelled by their nature and bound
by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious truth.
They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they come to know it
and to direct their whole lives in accordance with its demands."

<p>"The practice of religion of its very nature consists primarily of
those voluntary and free internal acts by which a human being directly
sets his course toward God. No merely human power can either command
or prohibit acts of this kind. But man's social nature itself requires
that he give external expression to his internal acts of religion,
that he communicate with others in religious matters and that he
profess his religion in community" (<i>Dignitatis Humanae</i>).

<p>These words touch the very substance of the question. They also show
how even the confrontation between the religious view of the world
and the agnostic or even atheistic view, which is one of the signs of
the times of the present age, could preserve honest and respectful
human dimensions without violating the essential rights of conscience
of any man or woman living on earth.

<p>Respect for the dignity of the human person would seem to demand that,
when the exact tenor of the exercise of religious freedom is being
discussed or determined with a view to national laws or international
conventions, the institutions that are by their nature at the service
of religion should also be brought in. If this participation is
omitted, there is a danger of imposing, in so intimate a field of
man's life, rules or restrictions that are opposed to his true
religious needs.

<p>The United Nations has proclaimed 1979 the Year of the Child. In the
presence of the representatives of so many nations of the world
gathered here, I wish to express the joy that we all find in children,
the springtime of life, the anticipation of the future history of each
of our present earthly homelands. No country on earth, no political
system can think of its own future otherwise than through the image of
these new generations that will receive from their parents the
manifold heritage of values, duties and aspirations of the nations to
which they belong and of the whole human family. Concern for the
child, even before birth, from the first moment of conception and then
throughout the years of infancy and youth, is the primary and
fundamental test of the relationship of one human being to another.

<p>And so, what better wish can I express for every nation and the whole
of mankind, and for all the children of the world than a better future
in which respect for human rights will become a complete reality
throughout the third millennium, which is drawing near.

<p>But in this perspective we must ask ourselves whether there will
continue to accumulate over the heads of this new generation of
children the threat of common extermination for which the means are in
the hands of the modern states, especially the major world powers. Are
the children to receive the arms race from us as a necessary
inheritance? How are we to explain this unbridled race?

<p>The ancients said: "Si vis pacem, para bellum." But can our age still
really believe that the breathtaking spiral of armaments is at the
service of world peace? In alleging the threat of a potential enemy,
is it really not rather the intention to keep for oneself a means of
threat, in order to get the upper hand with the aid of one's own
arsenal of destruction? Here too it is the human dimension of peace
that tends to vanish in favor of ever new possible forms of
imperialism.

<p>It must be our solemn wish here for our children, for the children of
all the nations on earth, that this point will never be reached. And
for that reason I do not cease to pray to God each day so that in his
mercy he may save us from so terrible a day.

<p>At the close of this address, I wish to express once more before all
the high representatives of the states who are present a word of
esteem and deep love for all the peoples, all the nations of the
earth, for all human communities. Each one has its own history and
culture. I hope that they will live and grow in the freedom and truth
of their own history. For that is the measure of the common good of
each one of them. I hope that each person will live and grow strong
with the moral force of the community that forms its members as
citizens. I hope that the state authorities, while respecting the just
rights of each citizen, will enjoy the confidence of all for the
common good. I hope that all the nations, even the smallest, even
those that do not yet enjoy full sovereignty. and those that have been
forcibly robbed of it, will meet in full equality with the others in
the United Nations organization. I hope that the United Nations will
ever remain the supreme forum of peace and justice, the authentic seat
of freedom of peoples and individuals in their longing for a better
future.
