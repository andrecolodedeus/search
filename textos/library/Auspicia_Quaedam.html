<h1>Auspicia Quaedam</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Pius XII</b>
<br><b>Encyclical on Public Prayers for World Peace and Solution of the Problem of Palestine</b>
<br><b>May 1, 1948</b>

<p><i>To Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Holy See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren: Peace and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Today there are appearing certain tokens which give clear proof that the
vast community of nations, after such destruction and ruin brought on by
the long and terrible war, is resolutely turned to the saving paths of
peace.

<p>2. At the moment, a more willing ear is given to those who are striving
to restore lost prosperity, to heal discords and to rebuild from the
mighty ruins under which we groan than to those who are inciting to
mutual and bitter dispute, to hate and dissension, from which nothing
else can arise but fresh and more serious evils to the nations.

<p>3. Nevertheless, although We and the Christian people have no light
motives of solace and of hope for better times, there are not lacking
circumstances and events which cause anxiety to our paternal heart.

<p>4. Even though the war has ceased in nearly every land, still benign
peace has not yet dawned on the minds and hearts of all men; indeed, the
sky is still heavy with threatening clouds.

<p>5. We, on our part, do not cease to do all in our power to stave off from
the family of nations dangers of threatening disasters; but when human
means are unequal to the task, then do We appeal in prayer first of all
to God; further, We also exhort all our children in Christ, throughout
the world, to implore, together with Us, in ardent prayer the Divine
assistance.

<p>6. For this reason, it was comforting for Us in past years to appeal
earnestly to all--especially to the young so dear to us--to crowd around
the altar of the great Mother of God during the month of May imploring
the end of a cruel war; so now, similarly today, by means of this
encyclical letter, We invite you not to cease from this pious practice
and further to prayers add resolutions for Christian renewal and salutary
works of penance.

<p>7. Above all, speak to the Virgin Mother of God and our most tender
Mother words of most heartfelt thanks for having obtained, through her
powerful intercession, the long desired termination of that great world
conflagration, and also for so many other graces obtained from the Most
High.

<p>8. At the same time, implore her, with renewed prayers, that at long last
there may shine forth, as a gift from Heaven, mutual, fraternal and
complete peace among all nations and the longed for harmony among all
social classes.

<p>Let there be an end to dissensions that redound to no one's advantage.

<p>Let there be a reconciliation of disputes that often sow the seeds of
further misfortunes.

<p>Let international relations, public and private, be fittingly
strengthened.

<p>Let religion, the foster mother of all virtues, enjoy the liberty to
which she is entitled.

<p>And let men set about their peaceful work of abundant production for the
common welfare-- with justice their guide and charity their motive.

<p>9. But you are aware, Venerable Brethren, that our prayers are most
readily welcomed by the Most Blessed Virgin when they are not merely
fleeting and empty words but the outpouring of hearts adorned with the
required virtues.

<p>10. See to it, then, as your apostolic zeal will suggest, that these
prayers in common during the month of May are matched by a corresponding
reform and revival of Christian conduct.

<p>11. For only from Christian virtues may we hope to see the course of
history take its proper, orderly direction, and men empowered not only to
achieve prosperity in this world with God's help but also to enjoy, with
the infusion of sanctifying grace. unending happiness in Heaven.

<p>12. But there is another special reason today which brings affliction and
keen anxiety to our hearts. We mean to refer to the Holy Places of
Palestine, which have long been disturbed.

<p>13. Indeed, if there exists any place that ought to be most dear to every
cultured person, surely it is Palestine, where, from the dawn of
antiquity, such great light of truth shone for all men, where the Word of
God made flesh announced, through the angels' choir, peace to all men;
where, finally, Christ hanging on the Cross acquired salvation for all
mankind, with arms outstretched as if He were inviting all nations to
fraternal harmony; and where He consecrated His precept of charity with
the shedding of His blood.

<p>14. We desire, therefore, Venerable Brethren, that supplications be
poured forth to the Most Holy Virgin for this request: that the situation
in Palestine may at long last be settled justly and thereby concord and
peace be also happily established.

<p>15. We place great confidence in the most powerful patronage of Our
Heavenly Mother--a patronage which, during this month dedicated to her,
innocent children especially will implore in a holy crusade of prayer.

<p>16. It will be precisely your task to invite and stimulate them with all
diligence--not only children but also fathers and mothers, who in great
numbers should give them leadership and example.

<p>17. We know well that We have never appealed in vain to the ardent zeal
which inflames your hearts. That is why We seem to enjoy already the
sight of dense multitudes of children, of men and women, crowding the
churches to beg from the great Mother of God all the graces and favors of
which we stand in need.

<p>18. May she, who has given us Jesus, obtain for us that all those who
have wandered from the path of rectitude may straightway return to Him,
moved by salutary contrition.

<p>19. May she obtain for us--she is our kindest Mother, who has shown
herself always, in the face of every danger, our powerful helper and
channel of grace--may she obtain for us, We say, that even in the midst
of the grievous need surrounding us a just solution will be found for
disputes, and that a firm and free peace will finally dawn resplendent
for the Church and for all nations.

<p>20. Some years ago, as all will remember, while the late war was still in
its fury, when human means showed themselves to be uncertain and
inadequate to that terrible conflagration, We addressed our fervent
prayers to the all merciful Redeemer, invoking the powerful patronage of
the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

<p>21. And even as our predecessor of immortal memory, Leo XIII, at the dawn
of the twentieth century saw fit to consecrate the whole human race to
the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, so We have likewise, in the guise of
representative of the whole human family which He redeemed, desired to
dedicate it in turn to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary.

<p>22. It is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests
itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in
each of the parishes and families. And We are confident that abundant
blessings and favors from Heaven will surge forth from this private and
public consecration.

<p>23. In token of these blessings, and in pledge of our paternal affection,
We impart from a full heart the Apostolic Benediction to each of you,
Venerable Brethren, to all those who make generous answer to this our
letter of exhortation, and particularly to the numerous throngs of our
most dear children.

<p>Given at Rome at St. Peter's, the first day of May of the year 1948, the
tenth of our Pontificate.
