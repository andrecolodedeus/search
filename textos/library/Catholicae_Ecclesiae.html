<h1>Catholicae Ecclesiae</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII</b>
<br><b>On Slavery in the Missions</b>
<br><b>November 20, 1890</b>

<p><i>To the Catholic Missionaries in Africa.</i>

<p>The maternal love of the Catholic Church embraces all people. As you know,
venerable brother, the Church from the beginning sought to completely
eliminate slavery, whose wretched yoke has oppressed many people. It is the
industrious guardian of the teachings of its Founder who, by His words and
those of the apostles, taught men the fraternal necessity which unites the
whole world. From Him we recall that everybody has sprung from the same
source, was redeemed by the same ransom, and is called to the same eternal
happiness. He assumed the neglected cause of the slaves and showed Himself
the strong champion of freedom. Insofar as time and circumstances allowed,
He gradually and moderately accomplished His goal. Of course, pressing
constantly with prudence and planning, He showed what He was striving for
in the name of religion, justice, and humanity. In this way He put national
prosperity and civilization in general into His debt. This zeal of the
Church for liberating the slaves has not languished with the passage of
time; on the contrary, the more it bore fruit, the more eagerly it glowed.
There are incontestable historical documents which attest to that fact,
documents which commended to posterity the names of many of Our
predecessors. Among them St. Gregory the Great, Hadrian I, Alexander III,
Innocent III, Gregory IX, Pius II, Leo X, Paul III, Urban VIII, Benedict
XIV, Pius VII, and Gregory XVI stand out. They applied every effort to
eliminate the institution of slavery wherever it existed. They also took
care lest the seeds of slavery return to those places from which this evil
institution had been cut away.

<p>2. We could not repudiate such a laudable inheritance. For this reason, We
have taken every occasion to openly condemn this gloomy plague of slavery.
We worked toward this goal in a letter sent to the bishops of Brazil on May
5, 1888. In it We rejoiced over their exemplary accomplishments, both
private and public, in the area of emancipation. At the same time We showed
how much slavery opposes religion and human dignity. While writing, We were
deeply moved by the plight of those who are subject to the mastery of
another. We were bitterly afflicted by accounts of the trials which harass
all the inhabitants of the African interior. How horrible it is to recall
that almost four hundred thousand Africans of every age and sex are
forcefully taken away each year from their villages! Bound and beaten, they
are transported to a foreign land, put on display, and sold like cattle.
These eyewitness reports have been confirmed by recent explorers to
equatorial Africa, arousing Our desire to help those wretched men and to
alleviate their lamentable condition. For this reason We have immediately
delegated the task of going to the principal countries of Europe to Our
beloved son Charles Martial Cardinal Lavigerie, whose swiftness and
apostolic zeal are well known. He is to show how shameful this base dealing
is and to incline the leaders and citizens to assist this miserable race.
Therefore, We should feel grateful to Christ our Lord, the most loving
Redeemer of all nations. He in His goodness did not allow Our efforts to go
unrewarded. Rather, He planted them in fertile soil, like a seed which
promises a joyful harvest. Secular leaders and Catholics from the whole
world, everybody who deems holy the natural rights of people, struggle to
discover the rationale and means to eradicate this inhuman commerce. There
was a meeting not long ago in Brussels for the representatives of European
leaders, and more recently a group of private citizens met in Paris for the
same purpose. They clearly showed how much force and persistence they would
use to defend the Negro cause, how many difficulties oppress these slaves.
Therefore, with the occasion once again given, We praise and thank the
leaders of Europe for their efforts in this matter. We strenuously pray
that almighty God might give a happy outcome to the deliberations they have
begun.

<p>3. Besides protecting freedom, another more serious apostolic concern
orders Us to spread the teaching of the Gospel in Africa. This teaching
should bathe those inhabitants living in darkness and blind superstition
with the light of divine truth, by which they can become co-heirs with Us
of the kingdom of God. We are the more concerned about this because those
who have received this light have also shaken off the yoke of human
slavery. Wherever Christian customs and laws are in force, wherever
religion establishes that men serve justice and honor human dignity,
wherever the spirit of brotherly love taught by Christ spreads itself,
there neither slavery nor savage barbarism can exist. Rather, mildness of
character and civilized Christian liberty flourish there. Many apostolic
men, like standard-bearing soldiers of Christ, go to the African interior
to shed their sweat, even life itself for the welfare of their brothers.
But "the harvest indeed is great; the laborers are few." Therefore, many
others are needed where that scandalous commerce is conducted. They must be
full of the spirit of God, fearing neither danger, nor inconveniences, nor
labors to spread the teaching of Christ, which is joined to true freedom.
This might enlighten even that wretched part of the human race with the
revelation of His divinity and release it from the mire of superstition and
misery in which it has lain abandoned and neglected for so long.

<p>4. The money collected in the churches and chapels under your jurisdiction
should be sent to Rome, to the Sacred Council for the Propagation of the
Faith. It will divide the money among the missions which now exist or will
be established primarily to eliminate slavery in Africa. The money coming
from those countries which have their own Catholic missions to free the
slaves, as We mentioned, will be given to sustain and help those missions.
The Sacred Council will divide the rest of the money among those missions
which show the greatest need, according to its discretion. We are confident
that God who is rich in mercies will graciously receive Our prayers for the
unfortunate Africans. You, venerable brother, should strive to complete
this matter. Timely and special assistance should be given by the faithful
to abolish the blemish of human commerce and to support the messengers of
the Gospel in those places where slavery exists. We trust that nothing will
diminish the generosity with which the faithful customarily support
Catholic missions, once the money is transferred to the Institute "For the
Propagation of the Faith."

<p>5. This salutary work which We have long since commended to the zeal of the
faithful demands many others of similar scope. A great outlay is required
to provide for the education of missionaries, long journeys, constructing
buildings, erecting churches, and teaching, as well as for other similar
necessities. These expenses must be borne for some years, until the heralds
of the gospel can establish themselves and take responsibility for their
own financial affairs. We hope that We have enough strength to undertake
such a project. When serious difficulties obstruct Us, We turn to you,
venerable brother, and the other bishops, as well as all Catholics. We
commend such a holy and salutary work to your love and to theirs. We desire
that everybody participates; even if the collection is small, the burden
spread among many people will make it lighter for all. Thus, the grace of
Christ--for this concerns the spreading of His kingdom--might reach
everybody and give everybody a share in peace, forgiveness of sins, and
special gifts.

<p>6. Therefore, We decree that every year, wherever the Epiphany of the Lord
is celebrated, on that day a collection should be taken up to help in the
project We have just outlined. We have chosen this day in preference to
others because, as you well know, that is the day the Son of God first
revealed Himself to the nations, when He showed Himself to the Magi. They
were called "the first fruits of our vocation and faith" by Our predecessor
St. Leo the Great. Thus, We depend on the good hope to come that Christ the
Lord will be moved by the love and prayers of the faithful, who have
received the light of truth. In a new testimony of praise, We pray that He
extend His bounty far and wide and that it flourish in happy prosperity.
Meanwhile, We lovingly impart Our apostolic blessing on you, venerable
brother, on the clergy, and on the faithful entrusted to your pastoral
vigilance.

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, on November 20, 1890, in the thirteenth
year of Our pontificate.
