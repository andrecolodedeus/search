<h1>Christi Nomen</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII</b>
<br><b>On Propagation of the Faith and Eastern Churches</b>
<br><b>December 24, 1894</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brethren, the Patriarchs, Primates, Bishops, and Other Local Ordinaries Enjoying Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Our first duty is to spread the name and reign of Christ more widely every
day, and to call back the mutinous and the wandering to the bosom of the
Church; this has occupied Our concern for a long time. For this reason We
never cease to safeguard and multiply pious projects and to support them
with the help gathered from the Catholic people. By this means the powerful
light of Christian wisdom is spread among the erring. We did this
especially in the third year of Our pontificate with the encyclical letter
"Sancta Dei Civitas" in order to win for the illustrious Society for the
Propagation of the Faith both greater support and generosity from the
faithful. Then We were pleased to follow with exhortations showing how it
had grown in a short time, from small beginnings to so large a stature; and
with what testimonies of praise and grants of indulgences Our illustrious
predecessors, Pius VII, Leo XII, Pius VIII, Gregory XVI, Pius IX had
honored it. Finally, Our exhortations demonstrated how much aid had been
given to the sacred missions throughout the world from this source, and how
much more was to be expected. Nor by God's blessing was the fruit small in
response to this exhortation. In the following years we saw the expansion
of this most worthy work, since the generosity of the faithful responded to
the zeal and the perseverance of the bishops. But now there is a new need
and one more grave, which may demand that the spirit of Catholic love
become more wide-spread. Venerable Brethren, may it stimulate your skill.

<p>2. From the apostolic letter "Praeclara" published last June, you know that
We invited and urged all nations to the unity of the Christian faith. Thus,
through Us the divine promise of "one sheepfold and one Pastor" would be
realized. You have learned from Our recent apostolic letters concerning the
safeguarding of the Eastern Rites that We look with special care to the
East and its churches, renowned and venerated by many names. From these
same letters you have learned the procedures by which, in consultation with
the Eastern patriarchs, We have investigated how to bring about more
readily the desired end, namely the union of the Roman and Eastern Catholic
Churches. We do not deny that this goal involves great difficulties. To
overcome them, Our strength is not sufficient; nevertheless We confidently
judge that the necessary strength of trust and of constancy is found in
God. For He who motivated Us to undertake this mission will in His
providence certainly supply the strength and the resources to complete it.
And this is what We implore from Him, and We exhort all the faithful to
also pray earnestly for this. Since the divine help must necessarily be
joined with human effort, it is right for Us therefore to expend special
care in seeking and supporting whatever seems to contribute to the end We
have in view.

<p>3. To ensure that the Eastern Christians who have seceded will return to
the one true Church, it is necessary to provide them with an abundance of
holy ministers who, endowed with doctrine and piety, may persuade the
others to accept the desired unity. In addition, Catholic wisdom and life
must be made known and imparted to them in such a fashion that it will fit
their national character congenially. Therefore houses must be opened
wherever expedient for the sacred education of the youth, a sufficient
number of high schools should be available, distributed according to
population. Their power of exercising each rite may thus be supplied with
dignity. Genuine knowledge of religion, should be extended to all by making
the best literature available. You can easily understand the costs of these
and similar ventures. You also understand that the Eastern Churches by
themselves cannot meet all these expenses. Nor can We Ourselves in these
hard times offer the help We would like. Suitable aid must be asked
principally from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith which We have
just now praised. Its purpose is entirely consonant with what We now have
in mind. But lest apostolic missions, deprived in part of the aids by which
they are sustained, suffer any harm, We must insist that the generosity of
the Catholics toward the Society become greater. It is fitting that a
similar concern also be applied to the Society for the Schools of the East
whose growth We encouraged, especially since its directors have openly
promised to contribute as much as possible for this worthy cause.

<p>4. For this, venerable brothers, We particularly ask your assistance. We do
not doubt that you, who are so eager to support with Us the cause of the
Church, will undertake this outstanding work. Zealously see to it that the
Society for the Propagation of the Faith grows as much as possible among
the faithful entrusted to your care. We are certain that many more will
eagerly give both their name and their resources to this Society if they
see clearly its excellence, the abundance of spiritual gifts it has to
offer, and the benefits which can now be rightly hoped for the Christian
cause. It certainly should move Catholic men to know that they can do
nothing for Us so pleasing, nor so salutary for themselves and the Church
than to meet Our desires by contributing. With their contributions We can
accomplish what We have resolved upon for the good of the Eastern Church.
May God, who alone is glorified with the spread of the Christian name and
its unity in faith and government, graciously bless Our beginnings and
favor Our desires. As an auspice of His choicest blessing, Venerable
Brethren, We most lovingly give Our Apostolic Blessing to all of you, your
clergy and your people.

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, December 24, 1894, in the seventeenth year
of Our pontificate.
