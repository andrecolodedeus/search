<h1>Constanti Hungarorum</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII</b>
<br><b>On the Church in Hungary</b>
<br><b>September 2, 1893</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brothers, the Primate, the Archbishops, Bishops and other Ordinaries, in Peace and Communion with the Holy See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brothers, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>The loyal affection and profound respect of the Hungarian people towards
this Apostolic See have always evoked deep fatherly love from the Roman
Pontiffs. We ourselves have frequently confirmed our personal esteem and
loving care. Indeed, we did so seven years ago when Hungary celebrated the
memory of an auspicious event. On that occasion we wrote to you recalling
the ancestral faith of the Hungarians, their virtues, and their glorious
deeds. We also counseled you on matters concerning the well-being of your
people in times so hostile to the Catholic cause. For the same reason and
for the same purpose, we feel constrained to write you again.

<p>2. Certainly, because of the nature of the recent, disturbing events, Our
concern demands that We earnestly exhort you and your clergy to fidelity,
unity, and zeal in teaching and in admonishing opportunely your people.
Other conditions among you present a new cause for anxiety to Us: We refer
to the dangers that day by day are becoming a more serious threat to
religion. To be sure, just as these dangers require our utmost concern and
attention, they also urgently demand greater efforts from you. We are
confident you will recompense fully Our counsel and expectations.

<p>3. The general duty of Catholics to preserve the integrity of religion in
their country in all vicissitudes, and to do so in a spirit of unity,
becomes a serious obligation during times of treacherous hostilities to
Christian institutions. Indeed, not only is the interest of the highest
good of all at stake, namely the eternal salvation of mankind, but also the
protection and preservation of the very things that in civil society
contribute most importantly to true peace and happiness. This was clearly
the conviction of those eminent men, brilliant examples of moral fortitude,
who were ready to sacrifice not only all their possessions, but their very
lives for the sake of religion and the Church. Among these heroes, your
Hungary has its share down the long course of your history. The fact that
you have persevered steadfastly in the Catholic faith is the result of the
firm determination of your people. They certainly understood perfectly that
when religion is at stake, so is the glory of the name and the existence
itself of their nation.

<p>4. Their determination has nurtured generous and remarkable virtues. Even
in the most critical times, their power has enabled the Hungarians to
oppose the magnitude of danger with an equal magnitude of courage and
constancy. Shielded, indeed, by these virtues, they resisted invincibly the
repeated incursions of the Tartars and the fierce attacks of the Muslims.
In this perilous struggle, they deserved all the help they received from
foreign peoples, from rulers, and from the Roman pontiffs. Not only was the
faith and sovereignty of the Hungarian people in jeopardy, but also the
Catholic faith itself and the safety of the West. By the same means,
Hungary escaped the tempests of more recent centuries that wrought such
serious havoc among neighboring peoples, though even Hungary felt their
violence and suffered no slight damages. Hungary, however, will survive if
the Hungarians only remain loyal to their religion, learn their daily
obligations, and fulfill them most faithfully.

<p>5. Now let us turn to those matters closer to our concerns, which filled
our heart with anguish when We saw them, moreover, written in the laws of
Hungary. As We deplored on another occasion, "they are incompatible with
the rights of the Church, restrict its capacity to act, and are detrimental
to the profession of the Catholic faith."[1] There have been other evils
these past years, either decreed or carried out by public authority, no
less destructive to the Church and to the Catholic faith. Considering the
direction in which your country is going, moreover, it is greatly to be
feared that there is impending evil far more harmful to religion.

<p>6. Consequently, be sure that you diligently do all that you can so that
priests and laity understand exactly what they are allowed to do and what
they must beware of lest they offend the precepts of natural and divine
law. As the majority of you who have pastoral responsibility gave orders to
await the judgment of the Holy See on these matters, it will be your urgent
duty to exhort the same ministers of the sacred mysteries to consider it
their religious duty not to depart in the least degree from the decision or
regulations of the Holy See. It goes without saying, moreover, that what is
forbidden for the clergy is by no means permitted the laity.

<p>7. In other respects, to remove the source of many evils, it is of utmost
importance that pastors never cease to admonish their flocks to refrain as
far as possible from entering into mixed marriages. Let the faithful
correctly understand and resolutely remember that it is their duty to
regard with horror such marriages, which the Church has always detested.
They are to be abhorred for the reason which we emphasized in another
letter, "They offer the opportunity for a forbidden sharing and
participation in sacred things; they create a danger to the religion of the
Catholic partner; they are an impediment to the virtuous education of
children and very often cause them to become accustomed to viewing all
religions as equal because they have lost the power of discriminating
between the true and the false."[2]

<p>8. There are, however, as We have warned you, still greater dangers
threatening the ancestral faith of the Hungarians. The enemies of the
Catholic faith are by no means concealing their intention to strive with
all their most harmful weapons to accomplish the daily deterioration of the
Church and the Catholic faith. We, therefore, exhort you, more urgently
than ever before, to spare neither effort nor labor to ward off such peril
from your flock and from your native land. It must be your primary care
that all your people, strengthened by your authority and example, undertake
with courage and zeal the cause of religion and always defend it firmly.
Very often it happens, indeed, and we shall speak frankly, that some
Catholics at the very time when they should be protecting and vindicating
the rights of the Church, led by a certain appearance of human prudence,
either turn away from the issue or prove themselves too timid or too
submissive. It is obvious that this procedure opens the way to grave danger
especially if it involves those in authority or those most influential in
shaping public opinion. More than the fact that they are unfaithful to the
just duty owed their office, they very often cause scandal and prevent the
harmony that results in unity of thought and action. Nothing, of course,
could be more welcome to the enemies of the Catholic faith than this apathy
or disagreement of Catholics. All too often, by avoiding bold arguments,
they allow the enemy to effect greater injustices with ease.

<p>9. In all matters, certainly, be prudent and moderate; the Church itself in
defense of the truth intends to follow a responsible mode of action.
Nothing, however, is so contradictory to the laws of true prudence than to
allow religion to be harassed with impunity and to endanger the moral
welfare of the people.

<p>10. Experience has truly proven that the annual meetings of Catholic men,
in which under episcopal leadership common directives are discussed
concerning Catholic affairs and the increase of pious activity, are
wonderfully effective in strengthening unity and in arousing the zealous
ingenuity of Catholics. We, therefore, ardently desire that these meetings
be held. Nor do We have any doubt that they will greatly contribute to the
success of your goals.

<p>11. It is fitting, too, that you be diligently aware that only men of
religious orthodoxy and proven virtue be elected to the legislative
assemblies, men who pursue objectives tenaciously, always ready to defend
the Church and the Catholic cause. You see, moreover, that the opponents of
the Church by means of periodicals and books are intent upon spreading
their venom and the perverse opinions of others, corrupting morality and
seducing the multitude. Therefore, your people should use every means to
counteract their writings with writings equal to the greatness of the
struggle and providing remedies appropriate to the evils.

<p>12. Above all, We wish you to direct your zeal and devotion towards the
education of children and adolescents. It is not Our intention to repeat
now what We have already written in the same letter that We mentioned in
the beginning of this one. We cannot, however, refrain from touching
briefly upon certain serious matters. In respect to primary schools, you
must insist that pastors and others who are in charge of souls be
constantly vigilant in their behalf and consider it their most important
duty to teach sacred doctrine to children. This special service should be
undertaken by themselves and valued as a sacred trust. It is certain that a
wholesome and pious education in childhood ensures in great measure not
only the preservation of the family. but of the state itself. Nor should
you spare any industry or ingenuity to help these schools increase and
develop successfully. It would be most appropriate to appoint in each
diocese supervisors of schools for both the diocese and the deaneries. The
bishops could confer with them annually on the condition of the schools as
well as on other matters pertaining to faith, morals, and the care of
souls. If it should be necessary to build new schools in answer to local
needs or enlarge those already established, we are fully confident that
your liberality and likewise that of all Catholics will be prompt and
generous.

<p>13. Regarding high schools and graduate schools, care should be taken that
the good, planted like seeds in the minds and hearts of children, be not
sadly destroyed in their adolescence. See that dangers of that kind be
removed or diminished. Most especially, your pastoral concern should avail
in selecting learned and virtuous teachers of religion and in removing
those causes that too often hinder fruitful results.

<p>14. For the rest, We appreciate your concerted efforts to maintain the
seats of highest studies under the authority of the Church and bishops in
accord with the will of their founders. We, nevertheless, exhort you to
continue to fulfill this obligation. It would certainly not be equitable to
deny Catholics that which is granted adversaries of the Catholic cause. It
is of common interest, moreover, that what our predecessors established so
piously and wisely should never be used to the detriment of the Church and
Catholic faith, but for the protection and defense of both and hence, for
the continuous good of the state itself.

<p>15. Finally, these recommendations also apply to seminarians and priests.
You should expend even greater effort on them that they may be worthy of
the priesthood and that they may manifest virtue fitting the times. For
this reason, the sacred seminaries justly claim the greater part of your
attention. Direct them in the best way possible and provide them with all
that is necessary so that through the dedication of selected teachers,
seminarians will be trained in the morals and virtues required by their
order and, moreover, in all the beauty and glory of doctrine, both human
and divine.

<p>16. For your clergy, the times require a very particular unanimity in your
guidance. concern and love in admonishing and exhorting them, and
extraordinary firmness in defending ecclesiastical discipline. In turn, all
priests should have strong faith in their bishops, accept their directives,
and support their undertakings. In their sacred duties and their pastoral
work, they should always be ready and zealous, guided by love.

<p>Because, moreover, priests set an example, they should be living models of
virtue and constancy. They should be cautious, however, not to get too
involved in civilian or political affairs, and let them often recall this
passage from St. Paul, "No one serving as God's soldier entangles himself
in worldly affairs, that he may please him whose approval he has secured."[3]

<p>17. To be sure, as St. Gregory the Great admonishes, it is not right to
abandon foresight in external matters in one's anxiety for spiritual
matters. Explicitly, when it is a question of defending religion or
promoting the common good, the latter is not to be disregarded. A priest
must be cautious not to overstep his dignity and deportment lest he seem
more concerned for human than heavenly affairs. Most aptly the same Gregory
the Great says, "Therefore, worldly occupations are sometimes to be
tolerated out of compassion, never however to be pursued out of love; lest
they, by burdening the mind of the lover, overwhelm him and make him sink
under their weight from heaven into the depths."[4]

<p>We also desire that you counsel pastors to take conscientious care of
church property and manage it most carefully. Where any negligence has
crept in, apply the most suitable remedy.

<p>18. We firmly believe, moreover, that this is the opportune time for the
clergy to revive the sodalities and confraternities of the laity to their
former honor and glory. Surely, this is a work redounding no less to the
well-being of the sodalities than to the universal good of religion. Not to
mention other advantages, these sodalities can help you and your clergy not
only by carefully cultivating in the people piety and a Christian way of
life, but also of strengthening that salutary harmony of mind and heart
that we strive for so ardently.

<p>19. Finally, in everything pertaining to the protection and defense of our
ancestral religion and faith, to the growth of Catholic institutions, or
even to the discipline of clergy, hold periodic conferences so that in
common discernment you will recognize those matters which are especially
compelling and timely.

<p>20. We hope that all the Catholics in Hungary will realize the dangerous
turn of affairs in their country and will find courage and strength in our
solicitude and good will. We hope, too, that on their part they will most
conscientiously obey our counsel and admonitions.

<p>21. May God be graciously present to you, venerable brothers, and likewise
to the clergy and the Catholic people working with you in one accord so
untiringly for the sake of religion, and may He happily bless your
initiatives. Nor indeed, may there be lacking in a cause so holy and just
the favorable assistance of your sovereign, we mean your apostle and king
who, already from the beginning of his reign, gave your people abundant
proof of his benevolence.

<p>22. Direct your ardent prayers with Us to God, venerable brothers, that all
may proceed successfully according to our desires. Above all, implore the
patronage of the most blessed mother of God; then, too, beseech your
faithful apostle, St. Stephen, to look favorably upon his Hungary and
preserve holy and inviolate the benefits of a holy religion.

<p>23. As a token of heavenly favors and as a witness of Our paternal good
will, We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Blessing to you, venerable brothers,
to the clergy and all your people.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, 2 September 1893, the sixteenth year of Our
Pontificate.
