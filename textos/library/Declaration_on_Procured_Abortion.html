<h1>Declaration on Procured Abortion</h1>  
<p><b>Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
<br>November 18, 1974</b>

<p>The problem of procured abortion and of its possible legal
liberalization has become more or less everywhere the subject of
impassioned discussions. These debates would be less grave were it not a
question of human life, a primordial value, which must be protected and
promoted. Everyone understands this, although many look for reasons, even
against all evidence, to promote the use of abortion. One cannot but be
astonished to see a simultaneous increase of unqualified protests against
the death penalty and every form of war and the vindication of the
liberalization of abortion, either in its entirety or in ever broader
indications. The Church is too conscious of the fact that it belongs to
her vocation to defend man against everything that could disintegrate or
lessen his dignity to remain silent on such a topic. Because the Son of
God became man, there is no man who is not His brother in humanity and who
is not called to become a Christian in order to receive salvation from
Him.

<p>2. In many countries the public authorities which resist the
liberalization of abortion laws are the object of powerful pressures aimed
at leading them to this goal. This, it is said, would violate no one's
conscience, for each individual would be left free to follow his own
opinion, while being prevented from imposing it on others. Ethical
pluralism is claimed to be a normal consequence of ideological pluralism.
There is, however, a great difference between the one and the other, for
action affects the interests of others more quickly than does mere
opinion. Moreover, one can never claim freedom of opinion as a pretext
for attacking the rights of others, most especially the right to life.

<p>3. Numerous Christian lay people, especially doctors, but also parents'
associations, statesmen, or leading figures in posts of responsibility
have vigorously reacted against this propaganda campaign. Above all, many
episcopal conferences and many bishops acting in their own name have
judged it opportune to recall very strongly the traditional doctrine of
the Church.[1] With a striking convergence these documents admirably
emphasize an attitude of respect for life which is at the same time human
and Christian. Nevertheless, it has happened that several of these
documents here or there have encountered reservation or even opposition.

<p>4. Charged with the promotion and the defense of faith and morals in the
universal Church,[2] the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
proposes to recall this teaching in its essential aspects to all the
faithful. Thus in showing the unity of the Church, it will confirm by the
authority proper to the Holy See what the bishops have opportunely
undertaken. It hopes that all the faithful, including those who might have
been unsettled by the controversies and new opinions, will understand that
it is not a question of opposing one opinion to another, but of
transmitting to the faithful a constant teaching of the supreme
Magisterium, which teaches moral norms in the light of faith.[3] It is
therefore clear that this declaration necessarily entails a grave
obligation for Christian consciences.[4] May God deign to enlighten also
all men who strive with their whole heart to "act in truth" (Jn. 3:21).

<p>5. "Death was not God's doing, he takes no pleasure in the extinction of
the living" (Wis. 1:13). Certainly God has created beings who have only
one lifetime and physical death cannot be absent from the world of those
with a bodily existence. But what is immediately willed is life, and in
the visible universe everything has been made for man, who is the image of
God and the world's crowning glory (cf. Gen. 1:26-28). On the human level,
"it was the devil's envy that brought death into the world" (Wis. 2:24).
Introduced by sin, death remains bound up with it: death is the sign and
fruit of sin. But there is no final triumph for death. Confirming faith
in the Resurrection, the Lord proclaims in the Gospel: "God is God, not of
the dead, but of the living" (Mt. 22:32). And death like sin will be
definitively defeated by resurrection in Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 15:20-27).
Thus we understand that human life, even on this earth, is precious.
Infused by the Creator,[5] life is again taken back by Him (cf. Gen. 2:7;
Wis. 15:11). It remains under His protection: man's blood cries out to
Him (cf. Gen. 4:10) and He will demand an account of it, "for in the image
of God man was made" (Gen. 9:5-6). The commandment of God is formal: "You
shall not kill" (Ex. 20:13). Life is at the same time a gift and a
responsibility. It is received as a "talent" (cf. Mt. 25:14-30); it must
be put to proper use. In order that life may bring forth fruit, many tasks
are offered to man in this world and he must not shirk them. More
important still, the Christian knows that eternal life depends on what,
with the grace of God, he does with his life on earth.

<p>6. The tradition of the Church has always held that human life must be
protected and favored from the beginning, just as at the various stages of
its development. Opposing the morals of the Greco-Roman world, the Church
of the first centuries insisted on the difference that exists on this
point between those morals and Christian morals. In the Didache it is
clearly said: "You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb and
you shall not murder the infant already born."[6] Athenagoras emphasizes
that Christians consider as murderers those women who take medicines to
procure an abortion; he condemns the killers of children, including those
still living in their mother's womb, "where they are already the object of
the care of divine Providence." Tertullian did not always perhaps use the
same language; he nevertheless clearly affirms the essential principle:
"To prevent birth is anticipated murder; it makes little difference
whether one destroys a life already born or does away with it in its
nascent stage. The one who will be a man is already one."[8]

<p>7. In the course of history, the Fathers of the Church, her Pastors and
her Doctors have taught the same doctrine--the various opinions on the
infusion of the spiritual soul did not introduce any doubt about the
illicitness of abortion. It is true that in the Middle Ages, when the
opinion was generally held that the spiritual soul was not present until
after the first few weeks, a distinction was made in the evaluation of the
sin and the gravity of penal sanctions. Excellent authors allowed for this
first period more lenient case solutions which they rejected for following
periods. But it was never denied at that time that procured abortion, even
during the first days, was objectively grave fault. This condemnation was
in fact unanimous. Among the many documents it is sufficient to recall
certain ones. The first Council of Mainz in 847 reconsidered the penalties
against abortion which had been established by preceding Councils. It
decided that the most rigorous penance would be imposed "on women who
procure the elimination of the fruit conceived in their womb."[9] The
Decree of Gratian reported the following words of Pope Stephen V: "That
person is a murderer who causes to perish by abortion what has been
conceived."[10] St. Thomas, the Common Doctor of the Church, teaches that
abortion is a grave sin against the natural law." At the time of the
Renaissance Pope Sixtus V condemned abortion with the greatest
severity.[12] A century later, Innocent XI rejected the propositions of
certain lax canonists who sought to excuse an abortion procured before the
moment accepted by some as the moment of the spiritual animation of the
new being.[13] In our days the recent Roman Pontiffs have proclaimed the
same doctrine with the greatest clarity. Pius XI explicitly answered the
most serious objections.[14] Pius XII clearly excluded all direct
abortion, that is, abortion which is either an end or a means.[15] John
XXIII recalled the teaching of the Fathers on the sacred character of life
"which from its beginning demands the action of God the Creator."[16] Most
recently, the Second Vatican Council, presided over by Paul VI, has most
severely condemned abortion: "Life must be safeguarded with extreme care
from conception; abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes."[17] The
same Paul VI, speaking on this subject on many occasions, has not been
afraid to declare that this teaching of the Church "has not changed and is
unchangeable."[18]

<p>8. Respect for human life is not just a Christian obligation. Human
reason is sufficient to impose it on the basis of the analysis of what a
human person is and should be. Constituted by a rational nature, man is a
personal subject capable of reflecting on himself and of determining his
acts and hence his own destiny: he is free. He is consequently master of
himself; or rather, because this takes place in the course of time, he has
the means of becoming so: this is his task. Created immediately by God,
man's soul is spiritual and therefore immortal. Hence man is open to God,
he finds his fulfillment only in Him. But man lives in the community of
his equals; he is nourished by interpersonal communication with men in the
indispensable social setting. In the face of society and other men, each
human person possesses himself, he possesses life and different goods, he
has these as a right. It is this that strict justice demands from all in
his regard.

<p>9. Nevertheless, temporal life lived in this world is not identified with
the person. The person possesses as his own a level of life that is more
profound and that cannot end. Bodily life is a fundamental good, here
below it is the condition for all other goods. But there are higher values
for which it could be legitimate or even necessary to be willing to expose
oneself to the risk of losing bodily life. In a society of persons the
common good is for each individual an end which he must serve and to which
he must subordinate his particular interest. But it is not his last end
and, from this point of view, it is society which is at the service of the
person, because the person will not fulfill his destiny except in God. The
person can be definitively subordinated only to God. Man can never be
treated simply as a means to be disposed of in order to obtain a higher
end.

<p>10. In regard to the mutual rights and duties of the person and of
society, it belongs to moral teaching to enlighten consciences; it belongs
to the law to specify and organize external behavior. There is precisely
a certain number of rights which society is not in a position to grant
since these rights precede society; but society has the function to
preserve and to enforce them. These are the greater part of those which
are today called "human rights" and which our age boasts of having
formulated.

<p>11. The first right of the human person is his life. He has other goods
and some are more precious, but this one is fundamental-- the condition of
all the others. Hence it must be protected above all others. It does not
belong to society, nor does it belong to public authority in any form to
recognize this right for some and not for others: all discrimination is
evil, whether it be founded on race, sex, color or religion. It is not
recognition by another that constitutes this right. This right is
antecedent to its recognition; it demands recognition and it is strictly
unjust to refuse it.

<p>12. Any discrimination based on the various stages of life is no more
justified than any other discrimination. The right to life remains
complete in an old person, even one greatly weakened; it is not lost by
one who is incurably sick. The right to life is no less to be respected in
the small infant just born than in the mature person. In reality, respect
for human life is called for from the time that the process of generation
begins. From the time that the ovum is fertilized, a life is begun which
is neither that of the father nor of the mother, it is rather the life of
a new human being with his own growth. It would never be made human if it
were not human already.

<p>13. To this perpetual evidence--perfectly independent of the discussions
on the moment of animation[19]--modern genetic science brings valuable
confirmation. It has demonstrated that, from the first instant, there is
established the program of what this living being will be: a man, this
individual man with his characteristic aspects already well determined.
Right from fertilization is begun the adventure of a human life, and each
of its capacities requires time--a rather lengthy time--to find its place
and to be in a position to act. The least that can be said is that present
science, in its most evolved state, does not give any substantial support
to those who defend abortion. Moreover, it is not up to biological
sciences to make a definitive judgment on questions which are properly
philosophical and moral such as the moment when a human person is
constituted or the legitimacy of abortion. From a moral point of view this
is certain: even if a doubt existed concerning whether the fruit of
conception is already a human person, it is objectively a grave sin to
dare to risk murder. "The one who will be a man is already one."[20]

<p>14. Divine law and natural reason, therefore, exclude all right to the
direct killing of an innocent man. However, if the reasons given to
justify an abortion were always manifestly evil and valueless the problem
would not be so dramatic. The gravity of the problem comes from the fact
that in certain cases, perhaps in quite a considerable number of cases, by
denying abortion one endangers important values to which it is normal to
attach great value, and which may sometimes even seem to have priority. We
do not deny these very great difficulties. It may be a serious question of
health, sometimes of life or death, for the mother; it may be the burden
represented by an additional child, especially if there are good reasons
to fear that the child will be abnormal or retarded; it may be the
importance attributed in different classes of society to considerations of
honor or dishonor, of loss of social standing, and so forth. We proclaim
only that none of these reasons can ever objectively confer the right to
dispose of another's life, even when that life is only beginning. With
regard to the future unhappiness of the child, no one, not even the father
or mother, can act as its substitute--even if it is still in the embryonic
stage--to choose in the child's name, life or death. The child itself,
when grown up, will never have the right to choose suicide; no more may
his parents choose death for the child while it is not of an age to decide
for itself. Life is too fundamental a value to be weighed against even
very serious disadvantages.[21]

<p>15. The movement for the emancipation of women, insofar as it seeks
essentially to free them from all unjust discrimination, is on perfectly
sound ground.[22] In the different forms of cultural background there is a
great deal to be done in this regard. But one cannot change nature. Nor
can one exempt women, any more than men, from what nature demands of them.
Furthermore, all publicly recognized freedom is always limited by the
certain rights of others.

<p>16. The same must be said of the claim to sexual freedom. If by this
expression one is to understand the mastery progressively acquired by
reason and by authentic love over instinctive impulse, without diminishing
pleasure but keeping it in its proper place--and in this sphere this is
the only authentic freedom--then there is nothing to object to. But this
kind of freedom will always be careful not to violate justice. It; on the
contrary, one is to understand that men and women are "free" to seek
sexual pleasure to the point of satiety, without taking into account any
law or the essential orientation of sexual life to its fruits of
fertility,[23] then this idea has nothing Christian in it. It is even
unworthy of man. In any case it does not confer any right to dispose of
human life--even if embryonic--or to suppress it on the pretext that it is
burdensome.

<p>17. Scientific progress is opening to technology--and will open still
more--the possibility of delicate interventions, the consequences of which
can be very serious, for good as well as for evil. These are achievements
of the human spirit which in themselves are admirable. But technology can
never be independent of the criterion of morality, since technology exists
for man and must respect his finality. Just as there is no right to use
nuclear energy for every possible purpose, so there is no right to
manipulate human life in every possible direction. Technology must be at
the service of man, so as better to ensure the functioning of his normal
abilities, to prevent or to cure his illnesses, and to contribute to his
better human development. It is true that the evolution of technology
makes early abortion more and more easy, but the moral evaluation is in no
way modified because of this.

<p>18. We know what seriousness the problem of birth control can assume for
some families and for some countries. That is why the last Council and
subsequently the encyclical "Humanae vitae" of July 25, 1968, spoke of
"responsible parenthood."[24] What we wish to say again with emphasis, as
was pointed out in the conciliar constitution "Gaudium et spes," in the
encyclical "Populorum progressio" and in other papal documents, is that
never, under any pretext, may abortion be resorted to, either by a family
or by the political authority, as a legitimate means of regulating
births.[25] The damage to moral values is always a greater evil for the
common good than any disadvantage in the economic or demographic order.

<p>19. The moral discussion is being accompanied more or less everywhere by
serious juridical debates. There is no country where legislation does not
forbid and punish murder. Furthermore, many countries had specifically
applied this condemnation and these penalties to the particular case of
procured abortion. In these days a vast body of opinion petitions the
liberalization of this latter prohibition. There already exists a fairly
general tendency which seeks to limit, as far as possible, all restrictive
legislation, especially when it seems to touch upon private life. The
argument of pluralism is also used. Although many citizens, in particular
the Catholic faithful, condemn abortion, many others hold that it is
licit, at least as a lesser evil. Why force them to follow an opinion
which is not theirs, especially in a country where they are in the
majority? In addition it is apparent that, where they still exist, the
laws condemning abortion appear difficult to apply. The crime has become
too common for it to be punished every time, and the public authorities
often find that it is wiser to close their eyes to it. But the
preservation of a law which is not applied is always to the detriment of
authority and of all the other laws. It must be added that clandestine
abortion puts women, who resign themselves to it and have recourse to it,
in the most serious dangers for future pregnancies and also in many cases
for their lives. Even if the legislator continues to regard abortion as an
evil, may he not propose to restrict its damage?

<p>20. These arguments and others in addition that are heard from varying
quarters are not conclusive. It is true that civil law cannot expect to
cover the whole field of morality or to punish all faults. No one expects
it to do so. It must often tolerate what is in fact a lesser evil, in
order to avoid a greater one. One must, however, be attentive to what a
change in legislation can represent. Many will take as authorization what
is perhaps only the abstention from punishment. Even more, in the present
case, this very renunciation seems at the very least to admit that the
legislator no longer considers abortion a crime against human life, since
murder is still always severely punished. It is true that it is not the
task of the law to choose between points of view or to impose one rather
than another. But the life of the child takes precedence over all
opinions. One cannot invoke freedom of thought to destroy this life.

<p>21. The role of law is not to record what is done, hut to help in
promoting improvement. It is at all times the task of the State to
preserve each person's rights and to protect the weakest. In order to do
so the State will have to right many wrongs. The law is not obliged to
sanction everything, but it cannot act contrary to a law which is deeper
and more majestic than any human law: the natural law engraved in men's
hearts by the Creator as a norm which reason clarifies and strives to
formulate properly, and which one must always struggle to understand
better, but which it is always wrong to contradict. Human law can abstain
from punishment, but it cannot declare to be right what would be opposed
to the natural law, for this opposition suffices to give the assurance
that a law is not a law at all.

<p>22. It must in any case be clearly understood that whatever may be laid
down by civil law in this matter, man can never obey a law which is in
itself immoral, and such is the case of a law which would admit in
principle the liceity of abortion. Nor can he take part in a propaganda
campaign in favor of such a law, or vote for it. Moreover, he may not
collaborate in its application. It is, for instance, inadmissible that
doctors or nurses should find themselves obliged to cooperate closely in
abortions and have to choose between the law of God and their professional
situation.

<p>23. On the contrary, it is the task of law to pursue a reform of society
and of conditions of life in all milieux, starting with the most deprived,
so that always and everywhere it may be possible to give every child
coming into this world a welcome worthy of a person. Help for families and
for unmarried mothers, assured grants for children, a statute for
illegitimate children and reasonable arrangements for adoption--a whole
positive policy must be put into force so that there will always be a
concrete, honorable and possible alternative to abortion.

<p>24. Following one's conscience in obedience to the law of God is not
always the easy way. One must not fail to recognize the weight of the
sacrifices and the burdens which it can impose. Heroism is sometimes
called for in order to remain faithful to the requirements of the divine
law. Therefore, we must emphasize that the path of true progress of the
human person passes through this constant fidelity to a conscience
maintained in uprightness and truth; and we must exhort all those who are
able to do so to lighten the burdens still crushing so many men and women,
families and children, who are placed in situations to which, in human
terms, there is no solution.

<p>25. A Christian's outlook cannot be limited to the horizon of life in this
world. He knows that during the present life another one is being
prepared, one of such importance that it is in its light that judgments
must be made.[26] From this viewpoint there is no absolute misfortune here
below, not even the terrible sorrow of bringing up a handicapped child.
This is the contradiction proclaimed by the Lord: "Happy those who mourn:
they shall be comforted" (Mt. 5:5). To measure happiness by the absence of
sorrow and misery in this world is to turn one's back on the Gospel.

<p>26. But this does not mean that one can remain indifferent to these
sorrows and miseries. Every man and woman with feeling, and certainly
every Christian, must be ready to do what he can to remedy them. This is
the law of charity, of which the first preoccupation must always be the
establishment of justice. One can never approve of abortion; but it is
above all necessary to combat its causes. This includes political action,
which will be in particular the task of the law. But it is necessary at
the same time to influence morality and to do everything possible to help
families, mothers and children. Considerable progress in the service of
life has been accomplished by medicine. One can hope that such progress
will continue, in accordance with the vocation of doctors, which is not to
suppress life but to care for it and favor it as much as possible. It is
equally desirable that, in suitable institutions, or, in their absence, in
the outpouring of Christian generosity and charity every form of
assistance should be developed.

<p>27. There will be no effective action on the level of morality unless at
the same time an effort is made on the level of ideas. A point of view--or
even more, perhaps a way of thinking--which considers fertility as an evil
cannot be allowed to spread without contradiction. It is true that not all
forms of culture are equally in favor of large families. Such families
come up against much greater difficulties in an industrial and urban
civilization. Thus in recent times the Church has insisted on the idea of
responsible parenthood, the exercise of true human and Christian prudence.

<p>Such prudence would not be authentic if it did not include generosity. It
must preserve awareness of the grandeur of the task of cooperating with
the Creator in the transmission of life, which gives new members to
society and new children to the Church. Christ's Church has the
fundamental solicitude of protecting and favoring life. She certainly
thinks before all else of the life which Christ came to bring: "I have
come so that they may have life and have it to the full" (Jn. 10:10). But
life at all its levels comes from God, and bodily life is for man the
indispensable beginning. In this life on earth sin has introduced,
multiplied and made harder to bear suffering and death. But in taking
their burden upon Himself, Jesus Christ has transformed them: for whoever
believes in Him, suffering and death itself become instruments of
resurrection. Hence Saint Paul can say: "I think that what we suffer in
this life can never be compared to the glory, as yet unrevealed, which is
waiting for us" (Rom. 8:18). And, if we make this comparison we shall add
with him: "Yes, the troubles which are soon over, though they weigh
little, train us for the carrying of a weight of eternal glory which is
out of all proportion to them" (2 Cor. 4:17).

<p>The Supreme Pontiff Pope Paul VI, in an audience granted to the
undersigned Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith on June 28, 1974, has ratified this Declaration on Procured Abortion
and has confirmed it and ordered it to be promulgated.

<p>Given in Rome, at the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,

does not envisage all the questions which can arise in connection with

basic principles are here recalled which must be for the theologians
themselves a guide and a rule, and confirm certain fundamental truths of
Catholic doctrine for all Christians.

when life begins, but they speak of the period of life which precedes
birth as being the object of God's attention: He creates and forms the
human being, like that which is moulded by His hand (cf. Ps. 118:73). It
would seem that this theme finds expression for the first time in Jer.
1:5. It appears later in many other texts. Cf. Is. 49:1-5; 46:3; Jb.

Epistle of Barnabas," IX, 5 uses the same expressions (cf. Funk, l.c.,
91-93).

<br>7. Athenagoras, "A plea on behalf of Christians," 35 (cf. PG. 6, 970: S.C.
3, pp. 166-167). One may also consult the "Epistle to Diogentus" (V, 6
Funk, o.c., I 399: S.C. 33), where it says of Christians: "They procreate
children, but they do not reject the foetus."

<br>8. Tertullian, "Apologeticum" (IX. 8 PL. 1, 371-372: Corp. Christ. 1, p.
103, 1, 31-36).

<br>9. Canon 21 (Mansi, 14, p. 909). Cf. Council of Elvira, canon 63 (Mansi,
2, p. 16) and the Council of Ancyra, canon 21 (ibid., 519). See also the
decree of Gregory III regarding the penance to be imposed upon those who
are culpable of this crime (Mansi 13, 292, c. 17).

<br>10. Gratian, "Concordantia Discordantium Canonum," c. 20, C. 2, q.[2].
During the Middle Ages appeal was often made to the authority of St.
Augustine who wrote as follows in regard to this matter in "De Nuptiis et
Concupiscentiis," c. 15: "Sometimes this sexually indulgent cruelty or
this cruel sexual indulgence goes so far as to procure potions which
produce sterility. If the desired result is not achieved, the mother
terminates the life and expels the foetus which was in her womb in such a
way that the child dies before having lived, or, if the baby was living
already in its mother's womb, it is killed before being born." (PL 44,
423-424: CSEL 33, 619. Cf. the "Decree of Gratian" q. 2, C. 32, c. 7.)

text.

(Acta Pii IX, V, 55-72; AAS 5 [1869], pp. 305-331; "Fontes Iuris

3719-21.

<br>15. The statements of Pius XII are express, precise and numerous; they
would require a whole study on their own. We quote only this one from the
Discourse to the Saint Luke Union of Italian Doctors of November 12, 1944,
because it formulates the principle in all its universality: "As long as a
man is not guilty, his life is untouchable, and therefore any act directly
tending to destroy it is illicit, whether such destruction is intended as
an end in itself or only as a means to an end, whether it is a question of
life in the embryonic stage or in a stage of full development or already
in its final stages" (Discourses and Radio-messages, VI, 183ff.).

<br>16. Encyclical "Mater et magistra," AAS 53 (1961), p. 447.

<br>17. "Gaudium et spes," 51. Cf. 27 (AAS 58 [1966], p. 1072; cf. 1047).

<br>18. The speech, "Salutiamo con paterna effusione," December 9, 1972, AAS
64 (1972), p. 737. Among the witnesses of this unchangeable doctrine one
will recall the declaration of the Holy Office, condemning direct abortion
(Denzinger 1890, AAS 17 [1884], p. 556; 22 [1888-1890], 748; Dz-Sch 3258).

<br>19. This declaration expressly leaves aside the question of the moment
when the spiritual soul is infused. There is not a unanimous tradition on
this point and authors are as yet in disagreement. For some it dates from
the first instant; for others it could not at least precede nidation. It
is not within the competence of science to decide between these views,
because the existence of an immortal soul is not a question in its field.
It is a philosophical problem from which our moral affirmation remains
independent for two reasons: (1) supposing a belated animation, there is
still nothing less than a human life, preparing for and calling for a soul
in which the nature received from parents is completed, (2) on the other
hand, it suffices that this presence of the soul be probable (and one can
never prove the contrary) in order that the taking of life involve
accepting the risk of killing a man, not only waiting for, but already in
possession of his soul.

<br>20. Tertullian, cited in footnote 8.

<br>21. Cardinal Villot, Secretary of State, wrote on October 19, 1973, to
Cardinal Dopfner, regarding the protection of human life: "(Die Kirche)
kann jedoch sur Behebung solcher Notsituationen weder empfangnisverhutende
Mittel noch erst recht nicht die Abtreibung als sittlich erlaubt erkennen"
("L'Osservatore Romano," German edition, October 26, 1973, p. 3).

matrimonii amorque coniugalis ad procreationem et educationem prolis
ordinantur, iisque veluti suo fastigio coronantur." Also paragraph 50:
"Matrimonium et amor coniugalis indole sua ad prolem procreandam et
educandam ordinantur."

supposes the use of only morally licit methods of birth regulation. Cf.
"Humanae vitae,"[14] (ibid., p. 490).

<br>26. Cardinal Villot, Secretary of State, wrote to the World Congress of
Catholic Doctors held in Barcelona, May 26, 1974: "Por lo que a la vida
humana se refiere, esta non es ciertamente univoca, mas bien se podria
decir que es un haz de vidas. No se puede reducir, sin mutilarlas
gravemente, las zonas de su ser, que, en su estrecha dependencia e
interaccion estan ordenadas las unas a las otras: zona corporal, zona
afectiva, zona mental, y ese transfondo del alma donde la vida divina,
recibida por la gracia, puede desplegarse mediante los dones del Espiritu
Santo" ("L'Osservatore Romano," May 29, 1974).
