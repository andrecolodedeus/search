<h1>Deiparae Virginis Mariae</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Pius XII</b>
<br><b>May 1, 1946</b>

<p><i>To the Patriarchs Primates, Archbishops, and other Ordinaries at Peace and in Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>The Christian people have never ceased to invoke and experience the
Blessed Virgin Mary's assistance, and therefore they have, at all times,
venerated her with ever growing devotion.

<p>2. And so, because love when it is true and deeply felt tends of its own
nature to manifest itself through ever renewed demonstrations, the
faithful have vied with one another all through the centuries in
expressing at all times their ardent piety toward the Queen of Heaven. In
our opinion, this is the reason why, for a long time past, numerous
petitions (those received from 1849 to 1940 have been gathered in two
volumes which, accompanied with suitable comments, have been recently
printed), from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests,
religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable
private persons have reached the Holy See, all begging that the bodily
Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and
proclaimed as a dogma of faith. And certainly no one is unaware of the
fact that this was fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in
the Vatican Council.

<p>3. But We, who are charged with the care of defending and developing the
Kingdom of Christ, have at the same time to exercise continual care and
vigilance to keep away everything adverse to this Kingdom, and to support
whatsoever may promote it. Therefore, from the beginning of Our
Pontificate, we had to examine most carefully whether it would be lawful,
convenient and useful to support with Our authority the above mentioned
petitions. We have not neglected and do not at present neglect to offer
insistent prays to God that He might clearly manifest the will of His
ever-adorable goodness in this instance.

<p>4. In order that We may receive the gift of heavenly light, do you,
Venerable Brethren, in pious competition, unite your entreaties with
Ours. But, while paternally exhorting you to do this, thus following the
example of Our Predecessors, and particularly that of Pius IX when about
to define the dogma of the Mother of God's Immaculate Conception, we
earnestly beg you to inform us about the devotion of your
clergy and people (taking into account their faith and piety) toward the
Assumption of the most Blessed Virgin Mary. More especially We wish to
know if you, Venerable Brethren, with your learning and prudence consider
that the bodily Assumption of the Immaculate Blessed Virgin can be
proposed and defined as a dogma of faith, and whether in addition to your
own wishes this is desired by your clergy and people.

<p>5. We shall be most grateful for your prompt response and we entreat an
abundance of divine favors and the favorable assistance of the heavenly
Virgin upon you, venerable brothers, and upon yours, while we most
lovingly impart our apostolic blessing in the Lord as a token of our
fatherly affection to you and to the flocks committed to your care.

<p>Given at Rome at St. Peter's on the first day of May in the year 1946,
the eighth of our pontificate.

NOTE: In view of worldwide request, Pope Pius XII sent this letter <i>in forma
del tutto reservata</i>, under date of May 1, 1946, to all the bishops of the
world asking what their clergy and people thought about the Assumption
and whether they themselves judged it "wise and prudent" that the dogma
should be defined. The document was originally printed in 11 Monitore
Ecclesiastico (fasc. 7-12, 1946; pp. 97-98) as a letter but was published
in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis in 1950 as an encyclical.
