<h1>Dominicae Cenae</h1>  
<p><b>On the Mystery and Worship of the Eucharist
<br>His Holiness Pope John Paul II
<br>Promulgated on February 24, 1980</b>

<p><i>To All the Bishops of the Church.</i>

<p>My venerable and dear brothers,

<p>AGAIN THIS YEAR, for Holy Thursday, I am writing a letter to all of
you. This letter has an immediate connection with the one which you
received last year on the same occasion, together with the letter to the
priests. I wish in the first place to thank you cordially for having
accepted my previous letters with that spirit of unity which the Lord
established between us, and also for having transmitted to your priests
the thoughts that I desired to express at the beginning of my pontificate.

<p>During the Eucharistic Liturgy of Holy Thursday, you renewed, together
with your priests, the promises and commitments undertaken at the moment
of ordination. Many of you, venerable and dear brothers, told me about it
later, also adding words of personal thanks, and indeed often sending
those expressed by your priests. Furthermore, many priests expressed
their joy, both because of the profound and solemn character of Holy
Thursday as the annual "feast of priests" and also because of the
importance of the subjects dealt with in the letter addressed to them.

<p>Those replies form a rich collection which once more indicates how dear
to the vast majority of priests of the Catholic Church is the path of the
priestly life, the path along which this Church has been journeying for
centuries: how much they love and esteem it, and how much they desire to
follow it for the future.

<p>At this point I must add that only a certain number of matters were dealt
with in the letter to priests, as was in fact emphasized at the beginning
of the document.[1] Furthermore, the main stress was laid upon the
pastoral character of the priestly ministry; but this certainly does not
mean that those groups of priests who are not engaged in direct pastoral
activity were not also taken into consideration. In this regard I would
refer once more to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council, and also
to the declarations of the 1971 Synod of Bishops.

<p>The pastoral character of the priestly ministry does not cease to mark
the life of every priest, even if the daily tasks that he carries out are
not explicitly directed to the pastoral administration of the sacraments.
In this sense, the letter written to the priests on Holy Thursday was
addressed to them all, without any exception, even though, as I said
above, it did not deal with all the aspects of the life and activity of
priests. I think this clarification is useful and opportune at the
beginning of the present letter:

<p>2. The present letter that I am addressing to you, my venerable and dear
brothers in the episcopate -- and which is, as I have said, in a certain
way a continuation of the previous one -- is also closely linked with the
mystery of Holy Thursday, and is related to the priesthood. In fact I
intend to devote it to the Eucharist, and in particular to certain
aspects of the Eucharistic Mystery and its impact on the lives of those
who are the ministers of It: and so those to whom this letter is directly
addressed are you, the bishops of the Church; together with you, all the
priests; and, in their own rank, the deacons too.

<p>In reality, the ministerial and hierarchical priesthood, the priesthood
of the bishops and the priests, and, at their side, the ministry of the
deacons -- ministries which normally begin with the proclamation of the
Gospel -- are in the closest relationship with the Eucharist. The Eucharist
is the principal and central raison d'otre of the sacrament of the
priesthood, which effectively came into being at the moment of the
institution of the Eucharist, and together with it.[2] Not without reason
the words "Do this in memory of me" are said immediately after the words
of eucharistic consecration, and we repeat them every time we celebrate
the holy Sacrifice.[3]

<p>Through our ordination -- the celebration of which is linked to the holy
Mass from the very first liturgical evidence[4] -- we are united in a
singular and exceptional way to the Eucharist. In a certain way we derive
from it and exist for it. We are also, and in a special way, responsible
for it -- each priest in his own community and each bishop by virtue of the
care of all the communities entrusted to him, on the basis of the
sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum that St. Paul speaks of.[5] Thus we
bishops and priests are entrusted with the great "mystery of Faith," and
while it is also given to the whole People of God, to all believers in
Christ, yet to us has been entrusted the Eucharist also "for" others, who
expect from us a particular witness of veneration and love towards this
sacrament, so that they too may be able to be built up and vivified "to
offer spiritual sacrifices."[6]

<p>In this way our eucharistic worship, both in the celebration of Mass and
in our devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, is like a life-giving current
that links our ministerial or hierarchical priesthood to the common
priesthood of the faithful, and presents it in its vertical dimension and
with its central value. The priest fulfills his principal mission and is
manifested in all his fullness when he celebrates the Eucharist,[7] and
this manifestation is more complete when he himself allows the depth of
that mystery to become visible, so that it alone shines forth in people's
hearts and minds, through his ministry. This is the supreme exercise of
the "kingly priesthood," "the source and summit of all Christian
life."[8]

<p>3. This worship is directed towards God the Father through Jesus Christ
in the Holy Spirit. In the first place towards the Father, who, as St.
John's Gospel says, "loved the world so much that he gave his only Son,
so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal
life."[9]

<p>It is also directed, in the Holy Spirit, to the incarnate Son, in the
economy of salvation, especially at that moment of supreme dedication and
total abandonment of Himself to which the words uttered in the Upper Room
refer: "This is my body given up for you. . . . This is the cup of my blood
shed for you. . . ."[10] The liturgical acclamation: "We proclaim your
death, Lord Jesus" takes us back precisely to that moment; and with the
proclamation of His resurrection we embrace in the same act of veneration
Christ risen and glorified "at the right hand of the Father," as also the
expectation of His "coming in glory." Yet it is the voluntary emptying of
Himself, accepted by the Father and glorified with the resurrection,
which, sacramentally celebrated together with the resurrection, brings us
to adore the Redeemer who "became obedient unto death, even death on a
cross."[11]

<p>And this adoration of ours contains yet another special characteristic.
It is compenetrated by the greatness of that human death, in which the
world, that is to say each one of us, has been loved "to the end."[12]

<p>Thus it is also a response that tries to repay that love immolated even
to the death on the cross: it is our "Eucharist," that is to say our
giving Him thanks, our praise of Him for having redeemed us by His death
and made us sharers in immortal life through His resurrection.

<p>This worship, given therefore to the Trinity of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, above all accompanies and permeates the
celebration of the Eucharistic Liturgy. But it must fill our churches
also outside the timetable of Masses. Indeed, since the Eucharistic
Mystery was instituted out of love, and makes Christ sacramentally
present, it is worthy of thanksgiving and worship. And this worship must
be prominent in all our encounters with the Blessed Sacrament, both when
we visit our churches and when the sacred species are taken to the sick
and administered to them.

<p>Adoration of Christ in this sacrament of love must also find expression
in various forms of eucharistic devotion: personal prayer before the
Blessed Sacrament, Hours of Adoration, periods of exposition -- short,
prolonged and annual (Forty Hours) -- eucharistic benediction, eucharistic
processions, eucharistic congresses.[13] A particular mention should be
made at this point of the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ as an
act of public worship rendered to Christ present in the Eucharist, a
feast instituted by my predecessor Urban IV in memory of the institution
of this great Mystery.[14] All this therefore corresponds to the general
principles and particular norms already long in existence but newly
formulated during or after the Second Vatican Council.[15]

<p>The encouragement and the deepening of eucharistic worship are proofs of
that authentic renewal which the council set itself as an aim and of
which they are the central point. And this, venerable and dear brothers,
deserves separate reflection. The Church and the world have a great need
of eucharistic worship. Jesus waits for us in this sacrament of love. Let
us be generous with our time in going to meet Him in adoration and in
contemplation that is full of faith and ready to make reparation for the
great faults and crimes of the world. May our adoration never cease.

<p>4. Thanks to the Council we have realized with renewed force the
following truth: Just as the Church "makes the Eucharist" so "the
Eucharist builds up" the Church[16]; and this truth is closely bound up
with the mystery of Holy Thursday. The Church was founded, as the new
community of the People of God, in the apostolic community of those
Twelve who, at the Last Supper, became partakers of the body and blood of
the Lord under the species of bread and wine. Christ had said to them:
"Take and eat. . . . Take and drink." And carrying out this command of His,
they entered for the first time into sacramental communion with the Son
of God, a communion that is a pledge of eternal life. From that moment
until the end of time, the Church is being built up through that same
communion with the Son of God, a communion which is a pledge of the
eternal Passover.

<p>Dear and venerable brothers in the episcopate, as teachers and custodians
of the salvific truth of the Eucharist, we must always and everywhere
preserve this meaning and this dimension of the sacramental encounter and
intimacy with Christ. It is precisely these elements which constitute the
very substance of eucharistic worship. The meaning of the truth expounded
above in no way diminishes -- in fact, it facilitates -- the eucharistic
character of spiritual drawing together and union between the people who
share in the sacrifice, which then in Communion becomes for them the
banquet. This drawing together and this union, the prototype of which is
the union of the Apostles about Christ at the Last Supper, express the
Church and bring her into being.

<p>But the Church is not brought into being only through the union of
people, through the experience of brotherhood to which the Eucharistic
Banquet gives rise. The Church is brought into being when, in that
fraternal union and communion, we celebrate the sacrifice of the cross of
Christ, when we proclaim "the Lord's death until he comes,"[17] and
later, when, being deeply compenetrated with the mystery of our
salvation, we approach as a community the table of the Lord, in order to
be nourished there, in a sacramental manner, by the fruits of the holy
Sacrifice of propitiation. Therefore in eucharistic Communion we receive
Christ, Christ Himself; and our union with Him, which is a gift and grace
for each individual, brings it about that in Him we are also associated
in the unity of His body which is the Church.

<p>Only in this way, through that faith and that disposition of mind, is
there brought about that building up of the Church, which in the
Eucharist truly finds its "source and summit," according to the
well-known expression of the Second Vatican Council.[18]

<p>This truth, which as a result of the same Council has received a new and
vigorous emphasis,[19] must be a frequent theme of our reflection and
teaching. Let all pastoral activity be nourished by it, and may it also
be food for ourselves and for all the priests who collaborate with us,
and likewise for the whole of the communities entrusted to us. In this
practice there should thus be revealed, almost at every step, that close
relationship between the Church's spiritual and apostolic vitality and
the Eucharist, understood in its profound significance and from all
points of view.[20]

<p>5. Before proceeding to more detailed observations on the subject of the
celebration of the holy Sacrifice, I wish briefly to reaffirm the fact
that eucharistic worship constitutes the soul of all Christian life. In
fact, Christian life is expressed in the fulfilling of the greatest
commandment, that is to say, in the love of God and neighbor, and this
love finds its source in the Blessed Sacrament, which is commonly called
the sacrament of love.

<p>The Eucharist signifies this charity, and therefore recalls it, makes it
present and at the same time brings it about. Every time that we
consciously share in it, there opens in our souls a real dimension of
that unfathomable love that includes everything that God has done and
continues to do for us human beings, as Christ says: "My Father goes on
working, and so do I."[21] Together with this unfathomable and free
gift, which is charity revealed in its fullest degree in the saving
sacrifice of the Son of God, the sacrifice of which the Eucharist is the
indelible sign, there also springs up within us a lively response of
love. We not only know love; we ourselves begin to love. We enter, so to
speak, upon the path of love and along this path make progress. Thanks to
the Eucharist, the love that springs up within us from the Eucharist
develops in us, becomes deeper and grows stronger.

<p>Eucharistic worship is therefore precisely the expression of that love
which is the authentic and deepest characteristic of the Christian
vocation. This worship springs from the love and serves the love to which
we are all called in Jesus Christ.[22] A living fruit of this worship is
the perfecting of the image of God that we bear within us, an image that
corresponds to the one that Christ has revealed in us. As we thus become
adorers of the Father "in spirit and truth,"[23] we mature in an ever
fuller union with Christ, we are ever more united to Him, and -- if one may
use the expression -- we are ever more in harmony with Him.

<p>The doctrine of the Eucharist, sign of unity and bond of charity, taught
by St. Paul,[24] has been in subsequent times deepened by the writings of
very many saints who are living examples for us of Eucharistic worship.
We must always have this reality before our eyes, and at the same time we
must continually try to bring it about that our own generation too may
add new examples to those marvelous examples of the past, new examples no
less living and eloquent, that will reflect the age to which we belong.

<p>6. The authentic sense of the Eucharist becomes of itself the school of
active love for neighbor. We know that this is the true and full order of
love that the Lord has taught us: "By this love you have for one another,
everyone will know that you are my disciples."[25] The Eucharist educates
us to this love in a deeper way; it shows us, in fact, what value each
person, our brother or sister, has in God's eyes, if Christ offers
Himself equally to each one, under the species of bread and wine. If our
Eucharistic worship is authentic, it must make us grow in awareness of
the dignity of each person. The awareness of that dignity becomes the
deepest motive of our relationship with our neighbor.

<p>We must also become particularly sensitive to all human suffering and
misery, to all injustice and wrong, and seek the way to redress them
effectively. Let us learn to discover with respect the truth about the
inner self that becomes the dwelling place of God present in the
Eucharist. Christ comes into the hearts of our brothers and sisters and
visits their consciences. How the image of each and every one changes,
when we become aware of this reality, when we make it the subject of our
reflections! The sense of the Eucharistic Mystery leads us to a love for
our neighbor, to a love for every human being.[26]

<p>7. Since therefore the Eucharist is the source of charity, it has always
been at the center of the life of Christ's disciples. It has the
appearance of bread and wine, that is to say of food and drink; it is
therefore as familiar to people, as closely linked to their life, as food
and drink. The veneration of God, who is love, springs, in eucharistic
worship, from that kind of intimacy in which He Himself, by analogy with
food and drink, fills our spiritual being, ensuring its life, as food and
drink do. This "eucharistic" veneration of God therefore strictly
corresponds to His saving plan. He Himself, the Father, wants the "true
worshipers"[27] to worship Him precisely in this way, and it is Christ
who expresses this desire, both with His words and likewise with this
sacrament in which He makes possible worship of the Father in the way
most in conformity with the Father's will.

<p>From this concept of eucharistic worship there then stems the whole
sacramental style of the Christian's life. In fact, leading a life based
on the sacraments and animated by the common priesthood means in the
first place that Christians desire God to act in them in order to enable
them to attain, in the Spirit, "the fullness of Christ himself."[28] God,
on His part, does not touch them only through events and by this inner
grace; He also acts in them with greater certainty and power through the
sacraments. The sacraments give the lives of Christians a sacramental
style.

<p>Now, of all the sacraments it is the Holy Eucharist that brings to
fullness their initiation as Christians and confers upon the exercise of
the common priesthood that sacramental and ecclesial form that links
it -- as we mentioned before[29] -- to the exercise of the ministerial
priesthood. In this way eucharistic worship is the center and goal of all
sacramental life.[30] In the depths of eucharistic worship we find a
continual echo of the sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism and
Confirmation. Where better is there expressed the truth that we are not
only "called God's children" but "that is what we are"[31] by virtue of
the sacrament of Baptism, if not precisely in the fact that in the
Eucharist we become partakers of the body and blood of God's only Son?
And what predisposes us more to be "true witnesses of Christ"[32] before
the world -- as we are enabled to be by the sacrament of Confirmation --
than Eucharistic Communion, in which Christ bears witness to us, and we
to Him?

<p>It is impossible to analyze here in greater detail the links between the
Eucharist and the other sacraments, in particular with the sacrament of
family life and the sacrament of the sick. In the encyclical Redemptor
hominis[33] I have already drawn attention to the close link between the
sacrament of Penance and the sacrament of the Eucharist. It is not only
that Penance leads to the Eucharist, but that the Eucharist also leads to
Penance. For when we realize who it is that we receive in Eucharistic
Communion, there springs up in us almost spontaneously a sense of
unworthiness, together with sorrow for our sins and an interior need for
purification.

<p>But we must always take care that this great meeting with Christ in the
Eucharist does not become a mere habit, and that we do not receive Him
unworthily, that is to say, in a state of mortal sin. The practice of the
virtue of penance and the sacrament of Penance are essential for
sustaining in us and continually deepening that spirit of veneration
which man owes to God Himself and to His love so marvelously revealed.
The purpose of these words is to put forward some general reflections on
worship of the Eucharistic Mystery, and they could be developed at
greater length and more fully. In particular, it would be possible to
link what has been said about the effects of the Eucharist on love for
others with what we have just noted about commitments undertaken towards
humanity and the Church in Eucharistic Communion, and then outline the
picture of that "new earth"[34] that springs from the Eucharist through
every "new self."[35] In this sacrament of bread and wine, of food and
drink, everything that is human really undergoes a singular
transformation and elevation. Eucharistic worship is not so much worship
of the inaccessible transcendence as worship of the divine condescension,
and it is also the merciful and redeeming transformation of the world in
the human heart.

<p>Recalling all this only very briefly, I wish, notwithstanding this
brevity, to create a wider context for the questions that I shall
subsequently have to deal with: These questions are closely linked with
the celebration of the holy Sacrifice. In fact, in that celebration there
is expressed in a more direct way the worship of the Eucharist. This
worship comes from the heart, as a most precious homage inspired by the
faith, hope and charity which were infused into us at Baptism. And it is
precisely about this that I wish to write to you in this letter,
venerable and dear brothers in the episcopate, and with you to the
priests and deacons. It will be followed by detailed indications from the
Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship.

<p>8. Beginning with the Upper Room and Holy Thursday, the celebration of
the Eucharist has a long history, a history as long as that of the
Church. In the course of this history the secondary elements have
undergone certain changes, but there has been no change in the essence of
the "Mysterium" instituted by the Redeemer of the world at the Last
Supper. The Second Vatican Council too brought alterations, as a result
of which the present liturgy of the Mass is different in some ways from
the one known before the Council. We do not intend to speak of these
differences: It is better that we should now concentrate on what is
essential and immutable in the Eucharistic Liturgy.

<p>There is a close link between this element of the Eucharist and its
sacredness, that is to say, its being a holy and sacred action. Holy and
sacred, because in it are the continual presence and action of Christ,
"the Holy One" of God,[36] "anointed with the Holy Spirit,"[37]
"consecrated by the Father"[38] to lay down His life of His own accord
and to take it up again,[39] and the High Priest of the New Covenant.[40]
For it is He who, represented by the celebrant, makes His entrance into
the sanctuary and proclaims His Gospel. It is He who is "the offerer and
the offered, the consecrator and the consecrated."[41] The Eucharist is a
holy and sacred action, because it constitutes the sacred species, the
Sancta sanctis, that is to say, the "holy things (Christ, the Holy One)
given to the Holy," as all the Eastern liturgies sing at the moment when
the eucharistic Bread is raised in order to invite the faithful to the
Lord's Supper.

<p>The sacredness of the Mass, therefore, is not a "sacralization," that is
to say, something that man adds to Christ's action in the Upper Room, for
the Holy Thursday supper was a sacred rite, a primary and constitutive
liturgy, through which Christ, by pledging to give His life for us,
Himself celebrated sacramentally the mystery of His passion and
resurrection, the heart of every Mass. Our Masses, being derived from
this liturgy, possess of themselves a complete liturgical form, which, in
spite of its variations in line with the families of rites, remains
substantially the same. The sacred character of the Mass is a sacredness
instituted by Christ. The words and actions of every priest, answered by
the conscious active participation of the whole eucharistic assembly,
echo the words and actions of Holy Thursday.

<p>The priest offers the holy Sacrifice in persona Christi; this means more
than offering "in the name of' or "in place of" Christ. In persona means
in specific sacramental identification with "the eternal High Priest"[42]
 who is the author and principal subject of this sacrifice of His, a
sacrifice in which, in truth, nobody can take His place. Only He -- only
Christ -- was able and is always able to be the true and effective
"expiation for our sins and . . . for the sins of the whole world."[43] Only
His sacrifice -- and no one else's -- was able and is able to have a
"propitiatory power" before God, the Trinity, and the transcendent
holiness. Awareness of this reality throws a certain light on the
character and significance of the priest celebrant who, by confecting the
holy Sacrifice and acting "in persona Christi," is sacramentally (and
ineffably) brought into that most profound sacredness, and made part of
it, spiritually linking with it in turn all those participating in the
eucharistic assembly.

<p>This sacred rite, which is actuated in different liturgical forms, may
lack some secondary elements, but it can in no way lack its essential
sacred character and sacramentality, since these are willed by Christ and
transmitted and regulated by the Church. Neither can this sacred rite be
utilized for other ends. If separated from its distinctive sacrificial
and sacramental nature, the Eucharistic Mystery simply ceases to be. It
admits of no "profane" imitation, an imitation that would very easily
(indeed regularly) become a profanation. This must always be remembered,
perhaps above all in our time, when we see a tendency to do away with the
distinction between the "sacred" and "profane," given the widespread
tendency, at least in some places, to desacralize everything.

<p>In view of this fact, the Church has a special duty to safeguard and
strengthen the sacredness of the Eucharist. In our pluralistic and often
deliberately secularized society, the living faith of the Christian
community -- a faith always aware of its rights vis-a-vis those who do not
share that faith -- ensures respect for this sacredness. The duty to
respect each person's faith is the complement of the natural and civil
right to freedom of conscience and of religion.

<p>The sacred character of the Eucharist has found and continues to find
expression in the terminology of theology and the liturgy.[44] This sense
of the objective sacred character of the Eucharistic Mystery is so much
part of the faith of the People of God that their faith is enriched and
strengthened by it.[45] Therefore the ministers of the Eucharist must,
especially today, be illumined by the fullness of this living faith, and
in its light they must understand and perform all that is part, by
Christ's will and the will of His Church, of their priestly ministry.

<p>9. The Eucharist is above all else a sacrifice. It is the sacrifice of
the Redemption and also the sacrifice of the New Covenant,[46] as we
believe and as the Eastern Churches clearly profess: "Today's sacrifice,"
the Greek Church stated centuries ago, "is like that offered once by the
Only-begotten Incarnate Word; it is offered by Him (now as then), since
it is one and the same sacrifice."[47] Accordingly, precisely by making
this single sacrifice of our salvation present, man and the world are
restored to God through the paschal newness of Redemption. This
restoration cannot cease to be: it is the foundation of the "new and
eternal covenant" of God with man and of man with God. If it were
missing, one would have to question both the excellence of the sacrifice
of the Redemption, which in fact was perfect and definitive, and also the
sacrificial value of the Mass. In fact, the Eucharist, being a true
sacrifice, brings about this restoration to God.

<p>Consequently, the celebrant, as minister of this sacrifice, is the
authentic priest, performing -- in virtue of the specific power of-sacred
ordination -- a true sacrificial act that brings creation back to God.
Although all those who participate in the Eucharist do not confect the
sacrifice as He does, they offer with Him, by virtue of the common
priesthood, their own spiritual sacrifices represented by the bread and
wine from the moment of their presentation at the altar. For this
liturgical action, which takes a solemn form in almost all liturgies, has
a "spiritual value and meaning."[48] The bread and wine become in a sense
a symbol of all that the eucharistic assembly brings, on its own part, as
an offering to God and offers spiritually.

<p>It is important that this first moment of the Liturgy of the Eucharist in
the strict sense should find expression in the attitude of the
participants. There is a link between this and the offertory "procession"
provided for in the recent liturgical reform[49] and accompanied, in
keeping with ancient tradition, by a psalm or song. A certain length of
time must be allowed, so that all can become aware of this act, which is
given expression at the same time by the words of the celebrant.

<p>Awareness of the act of presenting the offerings should be maintained
throughout the Mass. Indeed, it should be brought to fullness at the
moment of the consecration and of the anamnesis offering, as is demanded
by the fundamental value of the moment of the sacrifice. This is shown by
the words of the Eucharistic Prayer said aloud by the priest. It seems
worthwhile repeating here some expressions in the third Eucharistic
Prayer that show in particular the sacrificial character of the Eucharist
and link the offering of our persons with Christ's offering: "Look with
favor on your Church's offering, and see the Victim whose death has
reconciled us to yourself. Grant that we, who are nourished by his body
and blood, may be filled with his Holy Spirit, and become one body, one
spirit in Christ. May he make us an everlasting gift to you."

<p>This sacrificial value is expressed earlier in every celebration by the
words with which the priest concludes the presentation of the gifts,
asking the faithful to pray "that my sacrifice and yours may be
acceptable to God, the almighty Father." These words are binding, since
they express the character of the entire Eucharistic Liturgy and the
fullness of its divine and ecclesial content.

<p>All who participate with faith in the Eucharist become aware that it is a
"sacrifice," that is to say, a "consecrated Offering." For the bread and
wine presented at the altar and accompanied by the devotion and the
spiritual sacrifices of the participants are finally consecrated, so as
to become truly, really and substantially Christ's own body that is given
up and His blood that is shed. Thus, by virtue of the consecration, the
species of bread and wine re-present[50] in a sacramental, unbloody
manner the bloody propitiatory sacrifice offered by Him on the cross to
His Father for the salvation of the world. Indeed, He alone, giving
Himself as a propitiatory Victim in an act of supreme surrender and
immolation, has reconciled humanity with the Father, solely through His
sacrifice, "having canceled the bond which stood against us,"[51]

<p>To this sacrifice, which is renewed in a sacramental form on the altar,
the offerings of bread and wine, united with the devotion of the
faithful, nevertheless bring their unique contribution, since by means of
the consecration by the priest they become sacred species.

<p>This is made clear by the way in which the priest acts during the
Eucharistic Prayer, especially at the consecration, and when the
celebration of the holy Sacrifice and participation in it are accompanied
by awareness that "the Teacher is here and is calling for you."[52] This
call of the Lord to us through His Sacrifice opens our hearts, so that,
purified in the mystery of our Redemption, they may be united to Him in
Eucharistic Communion, which confers upon participation at Mass a value
that is mature, complete and binding on human life: "The Church's
intention is that the faithful not only offer the spotless victim but
also learn to offer themselves and daily to be drawn into ever more
perfect union, through Christ the Mediator, with the Father and with each
other, so that at last God may be all in all."[53]

<p>It is therefore very opportune and necessary to continue to actuate a new
and intense education, in order to discover all the richness contained in
the new liturgy. Indeed, the liturgical renewal that has taken place
since the Second Vatican Council has given, so to speak, greater
visibility to the Eucharistic Sacrifice. One factor contributing to this
is that the words of the Eucharistic Prayer are said aloud by the
celebrant, particularly the words of consecration, with the acclamation
by the assembly immediately after the elevation.

<p>All this should fill us with joy, but we should also remember that these
changes demand new spiritual awareness and maturity, both on the part of
the celebrant -- especially now that he celebrates "facing the people" -- and
by the faithful. Eucharistic worship matures and grows when the words of
the Eucharistic Prayer, especially the words of consecration, are spoken
with great humility and simplicity, in a worthy and fitting way, which is
understandable and in keeping with their holiness; when this essential
act of the Eucharistic Liturgy is performed unhurriedly; and when it
brings about in us such recollection and devotion that the participants
become aware of the greatness of the mystery being accomplished and show
it by their attitude.

<p>10. We are well aware that from the earliest times the celebration of the
Eucharist has been linked not only with prayer but also with the reading
of Sacred Scripture and with singing by the whole assembly. As a result,
it has long been possible to apply to the Mass the comparison, made by
the Fathers, with the two tables, at which the Church prepares for her
children the word of God and the Eucharist, that is, the bread of the
Lord. We must therefore go back to the first part of the sacred mystery,
the part that at present is most often called the Liturgy of the Word,
and devote some attention to it.

<p>The reading of the passages of Sacred Scripture chosen for each day has
been subjected by the Council to new criteria and requirements.[54] As a
result of these norms of the Council a new collection of readings has
been made, in which there has been applied to some extent the principle
of continuity of texts and the principle of making all the sacred books
accessible. The insertion of the Psalms with responses into the liturgy
makes the participants familiar with the great wealth of Old Testament
prayer and poetry. The fact that these texts are read and sung in the
vernacular enables everyone to participate with fuller understanding.

<p>Nevertheless, there are also those people who, having been educated on
the basis of the old liturgy in Latin, experience the lack of this "one
language," which in all the world was an expression of the unity of the
Church and through its dignified character elicited a profound sense of
the Eucharistic Mystery. It is therefore necessary to show not only
understanding but also full respect towards these sentiments and desires.
As far as possible these sentiments and desires are to be accommodated,
as is moreover provided for in the new dispositions.[55] The Roman Church
has special obligations towards Latin, the splendid language of ancient
Rome, and she must manifest them whenever the occasion presents itself.

<p>The possibilities that the post-conciliar renewal has introduced in this
respect are indeed often utilized so as to make us witnesses of and
sharers in the authentic celebration of the Word of God. There is also an
increase in the number of people taking an active part in this
celebration. Groups of readers and cantors, and still more often choirs
of men or women, are being set up and are devoting themselves with great
enthusiasm to this aspect. The Word of God, Sacred Scripture, is
beginning to take on new life in many Christian communities. The faithful
gathered for the liturgy prepare with song for listening to the Gospel,
which is proclaimed with the devotion and love due to it.

<p>All this is noted with great esteem and gratitude, but it must not be
forgotten that complete renewal makes yet other demands. These demands
consist in a new sense of responsibility towards the Word of God
transmitted through the liturgy in various languages, something that is
certainly in keeping with the universality of the Gospel and its
purposes. The same sense of responsibility also involves the performance
of the corresponding liturgical actions (reading or singing), which must
accord with the principles of art. To preserve these actions from all
artificiality, they should express such capacity, simplicity and dignity
as to highlight the special character of the sacred text, even by the
very manner of reading or singing.

<p>Accordingly, these demands, which spring from a new responsibility for
the Word of God in the liturgy,[56] go yet deeper and concern the inner
attitude with which the ministers of the Word perform their function in
the liturgical assembly.[57] This responsibility also concerns the choice
of texts. The choice has already been made by the competent
ecclesiastical authority, which has also made provision for the cases in
which readings more suited to a particular situation may be chosen.[58]

<p>Furthermore, it must always be remembered that only the Word of God can
be used for Mass readings. The reading of Scripture cannot be replaced by
the reading of other texts, however much they may be endowed with
undoubted religious and moral values. On the other hand such texts can be
used very profitably in the homily. Indeed the homily is supremely
suitable for the use of such texts, provided that their content
corresponds to the required conditions, since it is one of the tasks that
belong to the nature of the homily to show the points of convergence
between revealed divine wisdom and noble human thought seeking the truth
by various paths.

<p>11. The other table of the Eucharistic Mystery, that of the Bread of the
Lord, also requires reflection from the viewpoint of the present-day
liturgical renewal. This is a question of the greatest importance, since
it concerns a special act of living faith, and indeed, as has been
attested since the earliest centuries,[59] it is a manifestation of
worship of Christ, who in Eucharistic Communion entrusts Himself to each
one of us, to our hearts, our consciences, our lips and our mouths, in
the form of food. Therefore there is special need, with regard to this
question, for the watchfulness spoken of by the Gospel, on the part of
the pastors who have charge of eucharistic worship and on the part of the
People of God, whose "sense of the faith"[60] must be very alert and
acute particularly in this area.

<p>I therefore wish to entrust this question to the heart of each one of
you, venerable and dear brothers in the episcopate. You must above all
make it part of your care for all the churches entrusted to you. I ask
this of you in the name of the unity that we have received from the
Apostles as our heritage, collegial unity. This unity came to birth, in a
sense, at the table of the Bread of the Lord on Holy Thursday. With the
help of your brothers in the priesthood, do all you can to safeguard the
sacred dignity of the eucharistic ministry and that deep spirit of
Eucharistic Communion which belongs in a special way to the Church as the
People of God, and which is also a particular heritage transmitted to us
from the Apostles, by various liturgical traditions, and by unnumbered
generations of the faithful, who were often heroic witnesses to Christ,
educated in "the school of the cross" (Redemption) and of the Eucharist.

<p>It must be remembered that the Eucharist as the table of the Bread of the
Lord is a continuous invitation. This is shown in the liturgy when the
celebrant says: "This is the Lamb of God. Happy are those who are called
to his supper";[61] it is also shown by the familiar Gospel parable about
the guests invited to the marriage banquet.[62] Let us remember that in
this parable there are many who excuse themselves from accepting the
invitation for various reasons.

<p>Moreover our Catholic communities certainly do not lack people who could
participate in Eucharistic Communion and do not, even though they have no
serious sin on their conscience as an obstacle. To tell the truth, this
attitude, which in some people is linked with an exaggerated severity,
has changed in the present century, though it is still to be found here
and there. In fact what one finds most often is not so much a feeling of
unworthiness as a certain lack of interior willingness, if one may use
this expression, a lack of Eucharistic "hunger" and "thirst," which is
also a sign of lack of adequate sensitivity towards the great sacrament
of love and a lack of understanding of its nature.

<p>However, we also find in recent years another phenomenon. Sometimes,
indeed quite frequently, everybody participating in the eucharistic
assembly goes to Communion; and on some such occasions, as experienced
pastors confirm, there has not been due care to approach the sacrament of
Penance so as to purify one's conscience. This can of course mean that
those approaching the Lord's table find nothing on their conscience,
according to the objective law of God, to keep them from this sublime and
joyful act of being sacramentally united with Christ. But there can also
be, at least at times, another idea behind this: the idea of the Mass as
only a banquet[63] in which one shares by receiving the body of Christ in
order to manifest, above all else, fraternal communion. It is not hard to
add to these reasons a certain human respect and mere "conformity. "

<p>This phenomenon demands from us watchful attention and a theological and
pastoral analysis guided by a sense of great responsibility. We cannot
allow the life of our communities to lose the good quality of
sensitiveness of Christian conscience, guided solely by respect for
Christ, who, when He is received in the Eucharist, should find in the
heart of each of us a worthy abode. This question is closely linked not
only with the practice of the sacrament of Penance but also with a
correct sense of responsibility for the whole deposit of moral teaching
and for the precise distinction between good and evil, a distinction
which then becomes for each person sharing in the Eucharist the basis for
a correct judgment of self to be made in the depths of the personal
conscience. St. Paul's words, "Let a man examine himself,"[64] are well
known; this judgment is an indispensable condition for a personal
decision whether to approach Eucharistic Communion or to abstain.

<p>Celebration of the Eucharist places before us many other requirements
regarding the ministry of the eucharistic table. Some of these
requirements concern only priests and deacons, others concern all who
participate in the Eucharistic Liturgy. Priests and deacons must remember
that the service of the table of the Bread of the Lord imposes on them
special obligations which refer in the first place to Christ Himself
present in the Eucharist and secondly to all who actually participate in
the Eucharist or who might do so. With regard to the first, perhaps it
will not be superfluous to recall the words of the Pontificale which on
the day of ordination the bishop addresses to the new priest as he hands
to him on the paten and in the chalice the bread and wine offered by the
faithful and prepared by the deacon: "Accipe oblationem plebis sanctae
Deo offerendam. Agnosce quod agis, imitare quod tractabis, et vitam tuam
mysterio dominicae crucis conforma."[65] This last admonition made to him
by the bishop should remain as one of the most precious norms of his
eucharistic ministry.

<p>It is from this admonition that the priest's attitude in handling the
bread and wine which have become the body and blood of the Redeemer
should draw its inspiration. Thus it is necessary for all of us who are
ministers of the Eucharist to examine carefully our actions at the.
altar, in particular the way in which we handle that food and drink which
are the body and blood of the Lord our God in our hands: the way in which
we distribute Holy Communion; the way in which we perform the
purification.

<p>All these actions have a meaning of their own. Naturally, scrupulosity
must be avoided, but God preserve us from behaving in a way that lacks
respect, from undue hurry, from an impatience that causes scandal. Over
and above our commitment to the evangelical mission, our greatest
commitment consists in exercising this mysterious power over the body of
the Redeemer, and all that is within us should be decisively ordered to
this. We should also always remember that to this ministerial power we
have been sacramentally consecrated, that we have been chosen from among
men "for the good of men."[66] We especially, the priests of the Latin
Church, whose ordination rite added in the course of the centuries the
custom of anointing the priest's hands, should think about this.

<p>In some countries the practice of receiving Communion in the hand has
been introduced. This practice has been requested by individual episcopal
conferences and has received approval from the Apostolic See. However,
cases of a deplorable lack of respect towards the eucharistic species
have been reported, cases which are imputable not only to the individuals
guilty of such behavior but also to the pastors of the church who have
not been vigilant enough regarding the attitude of the faithful towards
the Eucharist. It also happens, on occasion, that the free choice of
those who prefer to continue the practice of receiving the Eucharist on
the tongue is not taken into account in those places where the
distribution of Communion in the hand has been authorized. It is
therefore difficult in the context of this present letter not to mention
the sad phenomena previously referred to. This is in no way meant to
refer to those who, receiving the Lord Jesus in the hand, do so with
profound reverence and devotion, in those countries where this practice
has been authorized.

<p>But one must not forget the primary office of priests, who have been
consecrated by their ordination to represent Christ the Priest: for this
reason their hands, like their words and their will, have become the
direct instruments of Christ. Through this fact, that is, as ministers of
the Holy Eucharist, they have a primary responsibility for the sacred
species, because it is a total responsibility: they offer the bread and
wine, they consecrate it, and then distribute the sacred species to the
participants in the assembly who wish to receive them. Deacons can only
bring to the altar the offerings of the faithful and, once they have been
consecrated by the priest, distribute them. How eloquent therefore, even
if not of ancient custom, is the rite of the anointing of the hands in
our Latin ordination, as though precisely for these hands a special grace
and power of the Holy Spirit is necessary!

<p>To touch the sacred species and to distribute them with their own hands
is a privilege of the ordained, one which indicates an active
participation in the ministry of the Eucharist. It is obvious that the
Church can grant this faculty to those who are neither priests nor
deacons, as is the case with acolytes in the exercise of their ministry,
especially if they are destined for future ordination, or with other lay
people who are chosen for this to meet a just need, but always after an
adequate preparation.

<p>12. We cannot, even for a moment, forget that the Eucharist is a special
possession belonging to the whole Church. It is the greatest gift in the
order of grace and of sacrament that the divine Spouse has offered and
unceasingly offers to His spouse. And precisely because it is such a
gift, all of us should in a spirit of profound faith let ourselves be
guided by a sense of truly Christian responsibility. A gift obliges us
ever more profoundly because it speaks to us not so much with the force
of a strict right as with the force of personal confidence, and
thus -- without legal obligations -- it calls for trust and gratitude. The
Eucharist is just such a gift and such a possession. We should remain
faithful in every detail to what it expresses in itself and to what it
asks of us, namely, thanksgiving.

<p>The Eucharist is a common possession of the whole Church as the sacrament
of her unity. And thus the Church has the strict duty to specify
everything which concerns participation in it and its celebration. We
should therefore act according to the principles laid down by the last
Council, which, in the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, defined the
authorizations and obligations of individual bishops in their dioceses
and of the episcopal conferences, given the fact that both act in
collegial unity with the Apostolic See.

<p>Furthermore we should follow the directives issued by the various
departments of the Holy See in this field: be it in liturgical matters,
in the rules established by the liturgical books in what concerns the
Eucharistic Mystery,[67] and in the Instructions devoted to this mystery,
be it with regard to communicatio in sacris, in the norms of the
Directorium de re oecumenica[68] and in the Instructio de peculiaribus
casibus admittendi alios christianos ad communionem eucharisticam in
Ecclesia catholica.[69] And although at this stage of renewal the
possibility of a certain "creative" freedom has been permitted,
nevertheless this freedom must strictly respect the requirements of
substantial unity. We can follow the path of this pluralism (which arises
in part from the introduction itself of the various languages into the
liturgy) only as long as the essential characteristics of the celebration
of the Eucharist are preserved, and the norms prescribed by the recent
liturgical reform are respected.

<p>Indispensable effort is required everywhere to ensure that within the
pluralism of eucharistic worship envisioned by the Second Vatican Council
the unity of which the Eucharist is the sign and cause is clearly
manifested.

<p>This task, over which in the nature of things the Apostolic See must keep
careful watch, should be assumed not only by each episcopal conference
but by every minister of the Eucharist, without exception. Each one
should also remember that he is responsible for the common good of the
whole Church. The priest as minister, as celebrant, as the one who
presides over the eucharistic assembly of the faithful, should have a
special sense of the common good of the Church, which he represents
through his ministry, but to which he must also be subordinate, according
to a correct discipline of faith. He cannot consider himself a
"proprietor" who can make free use of the liturgical text and of the
sacred rite as if it were his own property, in such a way as to stamp it
with his own arbitrary personal style. At times this latter might seem
more effective, and it may better correspond to subjective piety;
nevertheless, objectively it is always a betrayal of that union which
should find its proper expression in the sacrament of unity.

<p>Every priest who offers the holy Sacrifice should recall that during this
Sacrifice it is not only he with his community that is praying but the
whole Church, which is thus expressing in this sacrament her spiritual
unity, among other ways by the use of the approved liturgical text. To
call this position "mere insistence on uniformity" would only show
ignorance of the objective requirements of authentic unity, and would be
a symptom of harmful individualism.

<p>This subordination of the minister, of the celebrant, to the Mysterium
which has been entrusted to him by the Church for the good of the whole
People of God, should also find expression in the observance of the
liturgical requirements concerning the celebration of the holy Sacrifice.
These refer, for example, to dress, and in particular to the vestments
worn by the celebrant. Circumstances have of course existed and continue
to exist in which the prescriptions do not oblige. We have been greatly
moved when reading books written by priests who had been prisoners in
extermination camps, with descriptions of Eucharistic Celebrations
without the above-mentioned rules, that is to say, without an altar and
without vestments. But although in those conditions this was a proof of
heroism and deserved profound admiration, nevertheless in normal
conditions to ignore the liturgical directives can be interpreted as a
lack of respect towards the Eucharist, dictated perhaps by individualism
or by an absence of a critical sense concerning current opinions, or by a
certain lack of a spirit of faith.

<p>Upon all of us who, through the grace of God, are ministers of the
Eucharist, there weighs a particular responsibility for the ideas and
attitudes of our brothers and sisters who have been entrusted to our
pastoral care. It is our vocation to nurture, above all by personal
example, every healthy manifestation of worship towards Christ present
and operative in that sacrament of love. May God preserve us from acting
otherwise and weakening that worship by "becoming unaccustomed" to
various manifestations and forms of eucharistic worship which express a
perhaps "traditional" but healthy piety, and which express above all that
"sense of the faith" possessed by the whole People of God, as the Second
Vatican Council recalled.[70]

<p>As I bring these considerations to an end, I would like to ask
forgiveness -- in my own name and in the name of all of you, venerable and
dear brothers in the episcopate. for everything which, for whatever
reason, through whatever human weakness, impatience or negligence, and
also through the at times partial, one-sided and erroneous application of
the directives of the Second Vatican Council, may have caused scandal and
disturbance concerning the interpretation of the doctrine and the
veneration due to this great sacrament. And I pray the Lord Jesus that in
the future we may avoid in our manner of dealing with this sacred mystery
anything which could weaken or disorient in any way the sense of
reverence and love that exists in our faithful people.

<p>May Christ Himself help us to follow the path of true renewal towards
that fullness of life and of eucharistic worship whereby the Church is
built up in that unity that she already possesses, and which she desires
to bring to ever greater perfection for the glory of the living God and
for the salvation of all humanity.

<p>13. Permit me, venerable and dear brothers, to end these reflections of
mine, which have been restricted to a detailed examination of only a few
questions. In undertaking these reflections, I have had before my eyes
all the work carried out by the Second Vatican Council, and have kept in
mind Paul VI's Encyclical Mysterium Fidei, promulgated during that
Council, and all the documents issued after the same Council for the
purpose of implementing the post-conciliar liturgical renewal. A very
close and organic bond exists between the renewal of the liturgy and the
renewal of the whole life of the Church.

<p>The Church not only acts but also expresses herself in the liturgy, lives
by the liturgy and draws from the liturgy the strength for her life. For
this reason liturgical renewal carried out correctly in the spirit of the
Second Vatican Council is, in a certain sense, the measure and the
condition for putting into effect the teaching of that Council which we
wish to accept with profound faith, convinced as we are that by means of
this Council the Holy Spirit "has spoken to the Church" the truths and
given the indications for carrying out her mission among the people of
today and tomorrow.

<p>We shall continue in the future to take special care to promote and
follow the renewal of the Church according to the teaching of the Second
Vatican Council, in the spirit of an ever living Tradition. In fact, to
the substance of Tradition properly understood belongs also a correct
re-reading of the "signs of the times," which require us to draw from the
rich treasure of Revelation "things both new and old."[71] Acting in this
spirit, in accordance with this counsel of the Gospel, the Second Vatican
Council carried out a providential effort to renew the face of the Church
in the sacred liturgy, most often having recourse to what is "ancient,"
what comes from the heritage of the Fathers and is the expression of the
faith and doctrine of a Church which has remained united for so many
centuries.

<p>In order to be able to continue in the future to put into practice the
directives of the Council in the field of liturgy, and in particular in
the field of eucharistic worship, close collaboration is necessary
between the competent department of the Holy See and each episcopal
conference, a collaboration which must be at the same time vigilant and
creative. We must keep our sights fixed on the greatness of the most holy
Mystery and at the same time on spiritual movements and social changes,
which are so significant for our times, since they not only sometimes
create difficulties but also prepare us for a new way of participating in
that great Mystery of Faith.

<p>Above all I wish to emphasize that the problems of the liturgy, and in
particular of the Eucharistic Liturgy, must not be an occasion for
dividing Catholics and for threatening the unity of the Church. This is
demanded by an elementary understanding of that sacrament which Christ
has left us as the source of spiritual unity. And how could the
Eucharist, which in the Church is the sacramentum pietatis, signum
unitatis, vinculum caritatis,[72] form between us at this time a point of
division and a source of distortion of thought and of behavior, instead
of being the focal point and constitutive center, which it truly is in
its essence, of the unity of the Church herself?

<p>We are all equally indebted to our Redeemer. We should all listen
together to that spirit of truth and of love whom He has promised to the
Church and who is operative in her. In the name of this truth and of this
love, in the name of the crucified Christ and of His Mother, I ask you,
and beg you: Let us abandon all opposition and division, and let us all
unite in this great mission of salvation which is the price and at the
same time the fruit of our redemption. The Apostolic See will continue to
do all that is possible to provide the means of ensuring that unity of
which we speak. Let everyone avoid anything in his own way of acting
which could "grieve the Holy Spirit."[73]

<p>In order that this unity and the constant and systematic collaboration
which leads to it may be perseveringly continued, I beg on my knees that,
through the intercession of Mary, holy spouse of the Holy Spirit and
Mother of the Church, we may all receive the light of the Holy Spirit.
And blessing everyone, with all my heart I once more address myself to
you, my venerable and dear brothers in the episcopate, with a fraternal
greeting and with full trust. In this collegial unity in which we share,
let us do all we can to ensure that the Eucharist may become an ever
greater source of life and light for the consciences of all our brothers
and sisters of all the communities in the universal unity of Christ's
Church on earth.

<p>In a spirit of fraternal charity, to you and to all our confreres in the
priesthood I cordially impart the apostolic blessing.

<p>From the Vatican, February 24, First Sunday of Lent, in the year 1980,
the second of the Pontificate.

<br>20. This is what the Opening Prayer of Holy Thursday asks for: "We pray
that in this Eucharist we may find the fullness of love and life":

epiclesis of the Roman Missal: "May all of us who share in the body and
blood of Christ be brought together in unity by the Holy Spirit. Lord,
remember your Church throughout the world; make us grow in love":

<br>25. Jn. 13:35.

<br>26. This is expressed by many prayers of the Roman Missal: the Prayer
over the Gifts from the Common, "For those who work for the
underprivileged"; "May we who celebrate the love of your Son also follow
the example of your saints and grow in love for you and for one another":
Missale Romanum, ed. cit., p. 721; also the Prayer after Communion of the
Mass "For Teachers": "May this holy meal help us to follow the example of
your saints by showing in our lives the light of truth and love for our
brothers": ibid., p. 723; cf. also the Prayer after Communion of the Mass

<br>41. As was stated in the ninth-century Byzantine liturgy, according to
the most ancient codex, known formerly as Barberino di San Marco
(Florence), and, now that it is kept in the Vatican Apostolic Library, as
Barberini Greco 366 f. 8 verso, lines 17-20. This part has been published
by F.E. Brightman, Liturgies Eastern and Western, 1. Eastern Liturgies,
Oxford 1896, p. 318, 34-35.

<br>42. Opening Prayer of the Second Votive Mass of the Holy Eucharist:
Missale Romanum, ed. cit., p. 858.

<br>43. 1 Jn. 2:2; cf. ibid., 4:10.

<br>44. We speak of the divinum Mysterium, the Sanctissimum, the
Sacrosanctum, meaning what is sacred and holy par excellence. For their
part, the Eastern churches call the Mass raza or mysterion, hagiasmos,
quddasa, qedasse, that is to say "consecration" par excellence.
Furthermore there are the 'liturgical rites, which, in order to inspire a
sense of the sacred, prescribe silence, and standing or kneeling, and
likewise professions of faith, and the incensation of the Gospel book,
the altar, the celebrant and the sacred species. They even recall the
assistance of the angelic beings created to serve the Holy God, i.e.,
with the Sanctus of our Latin churches and the Trisagion and Sancta
Sanctis of the Eastern liturgies.

<br>45. For instance, in the invitation to receive communion, this faith has
been so formed as to reveal complementary aspects of the presence of
Christ the Holy One: the epiphanic aspect noted by the Byzantines
("Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord: The Lord is God and
has appeared to us" La divina Liturgia del santo nostro Padre Giovanni
Crisostomo, Roma-Grottaferrata 1967, pp. 136f.); the aspect of relation
and union sung of by the Armenians Liturgy of St. Ignatius of Antioch:
"Unus Pater sanctus nobiscum, unus Filius sanctus nobiscum, unus Spiritus
sanctus nobiscum". Die Anaphora des heiligen Ignatius von Antiochien,
ubersetzt von A. Rucker, Oriens Christianus, 3 ser., 5 [1930], p. 76);
and the hidden heavenly aspect celebrated by the Chaldeans and Malabars
(cf. the antiphonal hymn sung by the priest and the assembly after
Communion: F.E. Brightman, op. cit., p. 299.
