<h1>Dominum et Vivificantem</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical Letter of Pope John Paul II on the Holy Spirit (May 18, 1986)</b>

<p>Venerable Brothers, Beloved Sons and Daughters, Health and Apostolic Blessing!

<p>THE CHURCH PROFESSES HER FAITH in the
<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as "the Lord, the
giver of life". She professes this in the Creed which is called
<a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene-Constantinopolitan</a> from the name of the two
<a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">Councils</a> -- of
<a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a>
(A.D. 325) and
<a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Constantinople</a> (A.D. 381) -- at which it was formulated or
promulgated. It also contains the statement that the Holy Spirit "has
spoken through the
<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>".

<p>These are words which the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receives from the very source of her
faith,
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. In fact, according to the Gospel of John, the Holy
Spirit is given to us with the new life, as Jesus foretells and promises
on the great day of the
<a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a>: "If any one thirst, let him
come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said,
'Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water'". [1] And the
Evangelist explains: "This he said about the Spirit, which those who
believed in him were to receive". [2] It is the same simile of water which
Jesus uses in his conversation with the Samaritan woman, when he speaks
of "a spring of water welling up to eternal life", [3] and in his
conversation with
<a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>
when he speaks of the need for a new birth
"of water and the Spirit" in order to "enter the kingdom of God.". [4]

<p>The Church, therefore, instructed by the words of Christ, and drawing on
the experience of
<a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>
and her own apostolic history, has proclaimed
since the earliest centuries her faith in the Holy Spirit, as the giver
of life, the one in whom the inscrutable Triune God communicates himself
to human beings, constituting in them the source of eternal life.

<p>2. This faith, uninterruptedly professed by the Church, needs to be
constantly reawakened and deepened in the consciousness of the People of
God. In the course of the last hundred years this has been done several
times: by Leo XIII, who published the Encyclical Epistle <i>Divinum Illud
Munus</i> (1897) entirely devoted to the Holy Spirit; by Pius XII, who in the
Encyclical Letter <i>Mystici Corporis</i> (1943) spoke of the Holy Spirit as the
vital principle of the Church, in which he works in union with the Head
of the
<a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Mystical Body</a>, Christ; [5] at the Second Vatican Ecumenical
Council, which brought out the need for a new study of the doctrine on
the Holy Spirit, as Paul VI emphasized: "The Christology and particularly
the ecclesiology of the Council must be succeeded by a new study of and
devotion to the Holy Spirit, precisely as the indispensable complement to
the teaching of the Council." [6]

<p>In our own age, then, we are called anew by the ever ancient and ever new
faith of the Church, to draw near to the Holy Spirit as the giver of
life. In this we are helped and stimulated also by the heritage we share
with the
<a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, which have jealously guarded the
extraordinary riches of the teachings of the Fathers on the Holy Spirit.
For this reason too we can say that one of the most important ecclesial
events of recent years has been the Sixteenth Centenary of the First
Council of Constantinople, celebrated simultaneously in Constantinople
and Rome on the Solemnity of Pentecost in 1981. The Holy Spirit was then
better seen, through a meditation on the mystery of the Church, as the
one who points out the ways leading to the union of Christians, indeed as
the supreme source of this unity, which comes from God himself and to
which Saint Paul gave a particular expression in the words which are
frequently used to begin the Eucharistic liturgy: "The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you all". [7]

<p>In a certain sense, my previous Encyclicals
<i>Redemptor Hominis</i>
and
<i>Dives in Misericordia</i>
 took their origin and inspiration from this exhortation,
cerebrating as they do the event of our salvation accomplished in the
Son, sent by the Father into the world "that the world might be saved
through him" [8] and "every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
the glory of God the Father". [9] From this exhortation now comes the
present Encyclical on the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and
the Son; with the Father and the Son he is adored and glorified: a divine
Person, he is at the centre of the Christian faith and is the source and
dynamic power of the Church's renewal. [10] The Encyclical has been drawn
from the heart of the heritage of the Council. For the Conciliar texts,
thanks to their teaching on the Church in herself and the Church in the
world, move us to penetrate ever deeper into the Trinitarian mystery of
God himself, through the Gospels, the Fathers and the Iiturgy: to the
Father, through Christ, in the Holy Spirit.

<p>In this way the Church is also responding to certain deep desires which
she believes she can discern in people's hearts today: a fresh discovery
of God in his transcendent reality as the infinite Spirit, just as Jesus
presents him to the Samaritan woman; the need to adore him "in spirit and
truth" [11] the hope of finding in him the secret of love and the power of
a "new creation": [12] yes, precisely the giver of life.

<p>The Church feels herself called to this mission of proclaiming the
Spirit, while together with the human family she approaches the end ot
the second Millennium after Christ. Against the background of a heaven
and earth which will "pass away", she knows well that "the words which
will not pass away" [13] acquire a particular eloquence. They are the
words of Christ about the Holy Spirit, the inexhaustible source of the
"water welling up to eternal life", [14] as truth and saving grace. Upon
these words she wishes to reflect, to these words she wishes to call the
attention of believers and of all people, as she prepares to
celebrate -- as will be said later on -- the great Jubilee which will mark
the passage from the second to the third Christian Millennium.

<p>Naturally, the considerations that follow do not aim to explore
exhaustively the extremely rich doctrine on the Holy Spirit, nor to favor
any particular solution of questions which are still open. Their main
purpose is to develop in the Church the awareness that She is compelled
by the Holy Spirit to do her part towards the full realization of the
will of God, who has estab lished Christ as the source of salvation for
the whole world." [15]

<p>1. Jesus' promise and revelation at the Last Supper

<p>3. When the time for Jesus to leave this world had almost come, he told
the Apostles of "another Counsellor". [16] The evangelist John, who was
present, writes that, during the Last Supper before the day of his
Passion and Death, Jesus addressed the Apostles with these words:
"Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son . . . I will pray the Father, and he will give you
another Counsellor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth". [17]

<p>It is precisely this Spirit of truth whom Jesus calls the Paraclete -- and
<i>parakletos</i> means "counselor", and also "intercessor", or "advocate".
And he says that the Paraclete is "another" Counselor, the second one,
since he, Jesus himself, is the first Counsellor, [18] being the first
bearer and giver of the Good News. The Holy Spirit comes after him and
because of him, in order to continue in the world, through the Church,
the work of the Good News of salvation. Concerning this continuation of
his own work by the Holy Spirit Jesus speaks more than once during the
same farewell discourse, preparing the Apostles gathered in the Upper
Room for his departure, namely for his Passion and Death on the Cross.

<p>The words to which we will make reference here are found in the Gospel of
John. Each one adds a new element to that prediction and promise. And at
the same time they are intimately interwoven, not only from the viewpoint
of the events themselves but also from the viewpoint of the mystery of
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, which perhaps in no passage of Sacred
Scripture finds so emphatic an expression as here.

<p>4. A little while after the prediction just mentioned, Jesus adds: "But
the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he
will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have
said to you". [19] The Holy Spirit will be the Counsellor of the Apostles
and the Church, always present in their midst even though invisible as
the teacher of the same Good News that Christ proclaimed. The words "he
will teach" and "bring to remembrance" mean not only that he, in his own
particular way, will continue to inspire the spreading of the Gospel of
salvation but also that he will help people to understand the correct
meaning of the content of Christ's message; they mean that he will ensure
continuity and identity of understanding in the midst of changing
conditions and circumstances. The Holy Spirit, then, will ensure that in
the Church there will always continue the same truth which the Apostles
heard from their Master.

<p>5. In transmitting the Good News, the Apostles will be in a special way
associated with the Holy Spirit. This is how Jesus goes on: When the
Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the
Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to
me; and you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the
beginning". [20] The Apostles were the direct eyewitnesses. They have
heard and have seen with their own eyes", "have looked upon" and
even touched with their hands" Christ, as the evangelist John says in
another passage. [21] This human, first-hand and "historical" witness to
Christ is linked to the witness of the Holy Spirit: "He will bear witness
to me". In the witness of the Spirit of truth, the human testimony of the
Apostles will find its strongest support. And subsequently it will also
find therein the hidden foundation of its continuation among the
generations of Christ's disciples and believers who succeed one another
down through the ages.

<p>The supreme and most complete revelation of God to humanity is Jesus
Christ himself, and the witness of the Spirit inspires, guarantees and
con validates the faithful transmission of this revelation in the
preaching and writing of the Apostles," [22] while the witness of the
Apostles
ensures its human expression in the Church and in the history of humanity.

<p>6. This is also seen from the strict correlation of content and intention
with the just mentioned prediction and promise, a correlation found in
the next words of the text of John: "I have yet many things to say to
you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he
will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own
authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to
you the things that are to come" [23]

<p>In his previous words Jesus presents the Counsellor, the Spirit of truth,
as the one who "will teach" and "bring to remembrance, as the one who
"will bear witness" to him. Now he says: "He will guide you into all the
truth". This "guiding into all the truth, referring to what the Apostles
"cannot bear now", is necessarily connected with Christ's self-emptying
through his Passion and Death on the Cross, which, when he spoke these
words, was just about to happen.

<p>Later however it becomes clear that this "guiding into all the truth" is
connected not only with the scandal of the Cross, but also with
everything that Christ "did and taught". [24] For the mystery of Christ
taken as a whole demands faith, since it is faith that adequately
introduces man into the reality of the revealed mystery The "guiding into
all the truth" is therefore achieved in faith and through faith: and this
is the work of the Spirit of truth and the result of his action in man.
Here the Holy Spirit is to be man's supreme guide and the light of the
human spirit. This holds true for the Apostles, the eyewitnesses, who
must now bring to all people the proclamation of what Christ did and
taught, and especially the proclamation of his Cross and Resurrection.
Taking a longer view this also holds true for all the generations of
disciples and confessors of the Master, since they will have to accept
with faith and confess with candour the mystery of God at work in human
history, the revealed mystery which explains the definitive meaning of
that history.

<p>7. Between the Holy Spirit and Christ there thus subsists, in the economy
of salvation, an intimate bond, whereby the Spirit works in human history
as "another Counsellor", permanently ensuring the transmission and
spreading of the Good News revealed by Jesus of Nazareth. Thus, in the
Holy Spirit-Paraclete, who in the mystery and action of the Church
unceasingly continues the historical presence on earth of the Redeemer
and his saving work, the glory of Christ shines forth, as the following
words of John attest: "He (the Spirit of truth) will glorify me, for he
will take what is mine and declare it to you". [25] By these words all the
preceding statements are once again confirmed: "He will teach . . . , will
bring to your remembrance . . . , will bear witness. The supreme and complete
seIf-revelation of God, accomplished in Christ and witnessed to by the
preaching of the Apostles, continues to be manifested in the Church
through the mission of the invisible Counsellor, the Spirit of truth. How
intimately this mission is linked with the mission of Christ, how fully
it draws from this mission of Christ, consolidating and developing in
history its salvific results, is expressed by the verb "take": "he will
take what is mine and declare it to you". As if to explain the words "he
will take" by clearly expressing the divine and Trinitarian unity of the
source, Jesus adds: "All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said
that he will take what is mine and declare it to you". [26] By the very
fact of taking what is "mine", he will draw from "what is the Father's".

<p>In the light of these words "he will take", one can therefore also
explain the other significant words about the Holy Spirit spoken by Jesus
in the Upper Room before the Passover: "It is to your advantage that I go
away, for if I do not go away, the Counsellor will not come to you; but
if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes? he will convince the
world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment". [27] It will be
necessary to return to these words in a separate reflection.

<p>8. It is a characteristic of the text of John that the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit are clearly called Persons, the first distinct from
the second and the third, and each of them from one another. Jesus speaks
of the SpiritCounsellor, using several times the personal pronoun "he";
and at the same time, throughout the farewell discourse, he reveals the
bonds which unite the Father, the Son and the Paraclete to one another.
Thus "the Holy Spirit . . . proceeds from the Father" [28] and the Father
"gives" the Spirit. [29] The Father "sends" the Spirit in the name of the
Son, [30] the Spirit "bears witness" to the Son. [31] The Son asks the Father
to send the Spirit-Counsellor, [32] but likewise affirms and promises, in
relation to his own "departure" through the Cross: "If I go, I will send
him to you". [33] Thus, the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the power of
his Fatherhood, as he has sent the Son; [34] but at the same time he sends
him in the power of the Redemption accomplished by Christ -- and in this
sense the Holy Spirit is sent also by the Son: "I will send him to you".

<p>Here it should be noted that, while all the other promises made in the
Upper Room foretold the coming of the Holy Spirit after Christ's
departure, the one contained in the text of John 16:7ff also includes and
clearly emphasizes the relationship of interdependence which could be
called causal between the manifestation of each: "If I go, I will send
him to you". The Holy Spirit will come insofar as Christ will depart
through the Cross: he will come not only afterwards, but because of the
Redemption accomplished by Christ, through the will and action of the
Father.

<p>9. Thus in the farewell discourse at the Last Supper, we can say that the
highest point of the revelation of the Trinity is reached. At the same
time, we are on the threshold of definitive events and final words which
in the end will be translated into the great missionary mandate addressed
to the Apostles and through them to the Church: "Go therefore and make
disciples of all nations, a mandate which contains, in a certain sense,
the Trinitarian formula of baptism: "baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit". [35] The formula reflects
the intimate mystery of God, of the divine life, which is the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, the divine unity of the Trinity. The farewell
discourse can be read as a special preparation for this Trinitarian
formula, in which is expressed the life-giving power of the Sacrament
which brings about sharing in the life of the Triune God, for it gives
sanctifying grace as a supernatural gift to man. Through grace, man is
called and made "capable" of sharing in the inscrutable life of God.

<p>10. In his intimate life, God "is love, [36] the essential love shared by
the three divine Persons: personal love is the Holy Spirit as the Spirit
of the Father and the Son. Therefore he "searches even the depths of God", [37] as uncreated Love-Gift. It can be said that in the Holy Spirit the
intimate life of the Triune God becomes totally gift, an exchange of
mutual love between the divine Persons, and that through the Holy Spirit
God exists in the mode of gift. It is the Holy Spirit who is the personal
expression of this self-giving, of this being-love. [38] He is
Person-Love. He is Person-Gift. Here we have an inexhaustible treasure of
the reality and an inexpressible deepening of the concept of person in
God, which only divine Revelation makes known to us.

<p>At the same time, the Holy Spirit, being consubstantial with the Father
and the Son in divinity, is love and uncreated gift from which derives as
from its source (Fons vivus) all giving of gifts vis-a-vis creatures
(created gift): the gift of existence to all things through creation; the
gift of grace to human beings through the whole economy of salvation. As
the Apostle Paul writes: "God's love has been poured into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". [39] The salvific
self-fiving of God in the Holy Spirit

<p>11. Christ's farewell discourse at the Last Supper stands in particular
reference to this "giving" and "self-giving" of the Holy Spirit. In
John's Gospel we have as it were the revelation of the most profound
"logic" of the saving mystery contained in God's eternal plan, as an
extension of the ineffable communion of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
This is the divine "logic" which from the mystery of the Trinity leads to
the mystery of the Redemption of the world in Jesus Christ. The
Redemption accomplished by the Son in the dimensions of the earthly
history of humanity -- accomplished in his "departure" through the Cross
and Resurrection -- is at the same time, in its entire salvific power,
transmitted to the Holy Spirit: the one who "will take what is mine". [40]
 The words of the text of John indicate that, according to the divine
plan, Christ's "departure" is an indispensable condition for the
"sending" and the coming of the Holy Spirit, but these words also say
that what begins now is the new salvific self-giving of God, in the Holy
Spirit.

<p>12. It is a new beginning in relation to the first, original beginning of
God's salvific self-giving, which is identified with the mystery of
creation itself. Here is what we read in the very first words of the Book
of Genesis: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . . ,
and the Spirit of God (ruah Elohim) was moving over the face of the
waters". [41] This biblical concept of creation includes not only the call
to existence of the very being of the cosmos, that is to say the giving
of existence, but also the presence of the Spirit of God in creation,
that is to say the beginning of God's salvific self-communication to the
things he creates. This is true first of all concerning man, who has been
created in the image and likeness of God: "Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness". [42] "Let us make": can one hold that the plural
which the Creator uses here in speaking of himself already in some way
suggests the Trinitarian mystery, the presence of the Trinity in the work
of the creation of man? The Christian reader, who already knows the
revelation of this mystery, can discern a reflection of it also in these
words. At any rate, the context of the Book of Genesis enables us to see
in the creation of man the first beginning of God's salvific self-giving
commensurate with the "image and likeness" of himself which he has
granted to man.

<p>13. It seems then that even the words spoken by Jesus in the farewell
discourse should be read again in the light of that "beginning", so long
ago yet fundamental, which we know from Genesis. "If I do not go away,
the Counsellor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to
you". Describing his "departure" as a condition for the "coming" of the
Counsellor, Christ links the new beginning of God's salvific
self-communication in the Holy Spirit with the mystery of the Redemption.
It is a new beginning, first of all because between the first beginning
and the whole of human history -- from the original fall onwards -- sin has
intervened, sin which is in contradiction to the presence of the Spirit
of God in creation, and which is above all in contradiction to God's
salvific self-communication to man. Saint Paul writes that, precisely
because of sin, "creation . . . was subjected to futility . . . , has been
groaning in travail together until now" and "waits with eager longing for
the revealing of the sons of God". [43]

<p>14. Therefore Jesus Christ says in the Upper Room: "It is to your
advantage I go away; . . . if I go, I will send him to you". [44] The
"departure" of Christ through the Cross has the power of the
Redemption -- and this also means a new presence of the Spirit of God in
creation: the new beginning of God's self-communication to man in the
Holy Spirit. "And that you are children is proven by the fact that God
has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son who cries: Abba, Father!"_
as the Apostle Paul writes in the Letter to the Galatians. [45] The Holy
Spirit is the Spirit of the Father, as the words of the farewell
discourse in the Upper Room bear witness. At the same time he is the
Spirit of the Son: he is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, as the Apostles and
particularly Paul of Tarsus will testify. [46] With the sending of this
Spirit "into our hearts", there begins the fulfillment of that for which
"creation waits with eager longing", as we read in the Letter to the
Romans.

<p>The Holy Spirit comes at the price of Christ's "departure". While this
" departure" caused the Apostles to be sorrowful, [47] and this sorrow was
to reach its culmination in the Passion and Death on Good Friday, "this
sorrow will turn into joy," [48] For Christ will add to this redemptive
"departure" the glory of his Resurrection and Ascension to the Father.
Thus the sorrow with its underlying joy is, for the ApostIes in the
context of their Master's "departuren, an "advantageous" departure, for
thanks to it another "Counsellor" will come. [49] At the price of the
Cross which brings about the Redemption, in the power of the whole
Paschal mystery of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit comes in order to remain
from the day of Pentecost onwards with the Apostles, to remain with the
Church and in the Church, and through her in the world.

<p>In this way there is definitively brought about that new beginning of the
self-communication of the Triune God in the Holy Spirit through the work
of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of man and of the world.

<p>15. There is also accomplished in its entirety the mission of the
Messiah, that is to say of the One who has received the fullness of the
Holy Spirit for the Chosen People of God and for the whole of humanity.
"Messiah" literally means "Christ", that is, "Anointed One", and in the
history of salvation it means "the one anointed with the Holy Spirit".
This was the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament. Following this
tradition, Simon Peter will say in the house of Cornelius: "You must have
heard about the recent happenings in Judaea . . . after the baptism which
John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit
and with power" [50].

<p>From these words of Peter and from many similar ones, [51] one must first go
back to the prophecy of Isaiah, sometimes called "the Fifth Gospel" or
"the Gospel of the Old Testament".

<p>Alluding to the coming of a mysterious personage which the New Testament
revelation will identify with Jesus, Isaiah connects his person and
mission with a particular action of the Spirit of God -- the Spirit of the
Lord. These are the words of the Prophet: "There shall come forth a
shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
and the fear of the Lord. And his delight shall be tke fear of the
Lord". [52]

<p>This text is important for the whole pneumatology of the Old Testament,
because it constitutes a kind of bridge between the ancient biblical
concept of "spirit", understood primarily as a "charismatic breath of
wind", and the "Spirit" as a person and as a gift, a gift for the
person. The Messiah of the lineage of David ("from the stump of Jesse") is precisely that person upon whom the Spirit of the Lord "shall rest"
It is obvious that in this case one cannot yet speak of a revelation of
the Paraclete. However, with this veiled reference to the figure of the
future Messiah there begins, so to speak, the path towards the full
revelation of the Holy Spirit in the unity of the Trinitarian mystery, a
mystery which will finally be manifested in the New Covenant.

<p>16. It is precisely the Messiah himself who is this path. In the Old
Covenant, anointing had become the external symbol of the gift of the
Spirit. The Messiah (more than any other anointed personage in the Old
Covenant) is that single great personage anointed by God himselt. He is
the Anointed One in the sense that he possesses the fullness of the
Spirit of God. He himself will also be the mediator in granting this
Spirit to the whole People. Here in fact are other words of the Prophet:
"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anoinfed me
to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favour". [53]

<p>The Anointed One is also sent "with the Spirit of the Lord": "Now the
Lord God has sent me and his Spirit". [54]

<p>According to the Book of Isaiah, the Anointed One and the One sent
together with the Spirit of the Lord is also the chosen Servant ot the
Lord upon whom the Spirit of God comes down: "Behold my servant, whom I
uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon
him". [55]

<p>We know that the Servant of the Lord is revealed in the Book of Isaiah as
the true Man of Sorrows: the Messiah who suffers for the sins of the
world. [56] And at the same time it is precisely he whose mission will
bear for all humanity the true fruits of salvation: "He will bring
forth justice to the nations . . . "; [57] and he will become "a covenant to
the people, a light to the nations . . . "; [58] "that my salvation may reach
to the end of the earth" [59]

<p>For: "My spirit which is upon you, and my words which I have put in your
mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your
children's children, says the Lord, from this time forth and for
evermore." [60]

<p>The prophetic texts quoted here are to be read in the light of the
Gospel -- just as, in its turn, the New Testament draws a particular
clarification from the marvellous light contained in these Old Testament
texts. The Prophet presents the Messiah as the one who comes in the Holy
Spirit, the one who possesses the fullness of this Spirit in himself and
at the same time for others, for Israel, for all the nations, for all
humanity. The fullness of the Spirit of God is accompanied by many
different gifts, the treasures of salvation, destined in a particular way
for the poor and suffering, for all those who open their hearts to these
gifts sometimes through the painful experience of their own existence
 -- but first of all through that interior availability which comes from
faith. The aged Simeon, the "righteous and devout man" upon whom "rested
the Holy Spirit", sensed this at the moment of Jesus' presentation in the
Temple, when he perceived in him the "salvation . . . prepared in the
presence of all peoples" at the price of the great suffering -- the
Cross -- which he would have to embrace together with his Mother. [61] The
Virgin Mary, who "had conceived by the Holy Spirit", [62] sensed this even
more clearly, when she pondered in her heart the "mysteries" of the
Messiah, with whom she was associated. [63]

<p>17. Here it must be emphasized that clearly the "spirit of the Lord" who
rests upon the future Messiah is above all a gift of God tor the person
of that Servant of the Lord. But the latter is not an isolated and
independent person, because he acts in accordance with the will of the
Lord, by virtue of the Lord's decision or choice. Even though in the
light of the texts of Isaiah the salvific work of the Messiah, the
Servant of the Lord, incIudes the action of the Spirit which is carried
out through himself, nevertheless in the Old Testament context there is
no suggestion of a distinction of subjects, or of the Divine Persons as
they subsist in the mystery of the Trinity, and as they are later
reveaIed in the New Testament. Both in Isaiah and in the whole of the Old
Testament the personality of the Holy Spirit is completely hidden: in the
revelation of the one God, as also in the foretelling of the future
Messiah.

<p>18. Jesus Christ will make reference to this prediction contained in the
words of Isaiah at the beginning of his messianic activity. This will
happen in the same Nazareth where he had lived for thirty years in the
house of Joseph the carpenter, with Mary, his Virgin Mother. When he had
occasion to speak in the Synagogue, he opened the Book of Isaiah and
found the passage where it was written: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon
me, because he has anointed me"; and having read this passage he said to
those present: "Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your
hearing". [64] In this way he confessed and proclaimed that he was the
Messiah, the one in whom the Holy Spirit dwells as the gift of God
himself, the one who possesses the fullness of this Spirit, the one who
marks the "new beginning" of the gift which God makes to humanity in the
Spirit.

<p>19. Even though in his home-town of Nazareth Jesus is not accepted as the
Messiah, nonetheless, at the beginning of his public activity, his
messianic mission in the Holy Spirit is revealed to the people by John
the Baptist. The latter, the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, foretells at
the Jordan the coming of the Messiah and administers the baptism of
repentance. He says: "I baptize you with water; he who is mightier than I
is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will
baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire". [65]

<p>John the Baptist foretells the Messiah-Christ not only as the one who "is
coming" in the Holy Spirit but also as the one who "brings" the Holy
Spirit, as Jesus will reveal more clearly in the Upper Room. Here John
faithfully echoes the words of Isaiah, words which in the ancient Prophet
concerned the future, while in John's teaching on the banks of the Jordan
they are the immediate introduction to the new messianic reality. John is
not only a prophet but also a messenger: he is the precursor of Christ.
What he foretells is accomplished before the eyes of all. Jesus of
Nazareth too comes to the Jordan to receive the baptism of repentance. At
the sight of him arriving, John proclaims: "Behold, the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world". [66] He says this through the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, [67] bearing witness to the fulfilment of
the prophecy of Isaiah. At the same time he confesses his faith in the
redeeming mission of Jesus of Nazareth. On the lips of John the Baptist,
"Lamb of God" is an expression of truth about the Redeemer no less
significant than the one used by Isaiah: "Servant of the Lord".

<p>Thus, by the testimony of John at the Jordan, Jesus of Nazareth, rejected
by his own fellowcitizens, is exalted before the eyes of Israel as the
Messiah, that is to say the "One Anointed" with the Holy Spirit. And this
testimony is corroborated by another testimony of a higher order,
mentioned by the three Synoptics. For when all the people were baptized
and as Jesus, having received baptism, was praying, "the heaven was
opened, and the Holy Spirit decended upon him in bodily form, as a
dove" [68] and at the same time "a voice from heaven said 'This is my
beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased'". [69]

<p>This is a Trinitarian theophany which bears witness to the exaltation of
Christ on the occasion of his baptism in the Jordan. It not only confirms
the testimony of John the Baptist but also reveals another more profound
dimension of the truth about Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah. It is this:
the Messiah is the beloved Son of the Father. His solemn exaltation
cannot be reduced to the messianic mission of the "Servant of the Lord".
In the light of the theophany at the Jordan, this exaltation touches the
mystery of the very person of the Messiah. He has been raised up because
he is the beloved Son in whom God is well pleased. The voice from on high
says: "my Son".

<p>20. The theophany at the Jordan clarifies only in a fleeting way the
mystery of Jesus of Nazareth, whose entire activity will be carried out
in the active presence of the Holy Spirit. [70] This mystery would be
gradually revealed and confirmed by Jesus himself by means of everything
that he "did and taught". [71] In the course of this teaching and of the
messianic signs which Jesus performed before he came to the farewell
discourse in the Upper Room, we find events and words which constitute
particularly irnportant stages of this progressive revelation. Thus the
evangelist Luke, who has already presented Jesus as "full of the Holy
Spirit" and "led by the Spirit . . . in the wilderness", [72] tells us that,
after the return of the seventy-two disciples from the mission entrusted
to them by the Master, [73] while they were joyfully recounting the fruits
of their labours, "in that same hour (Jesus) rejoiced in the Holy Spirit
and said: 'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have
hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to
babes; yea, Father for such was your gracious will". [74] Jesus rejoices
at the fatherhood of God: he rejoices because it has been given to him to
reveal this fatherhood; he rejoices, finally, as at a particular
outpouring of this divine fatherhood on the "little ones". And the
evangelist describes all this as "rejoicing in the Holy Spirit".

<p>This "rejoicing" in a certain sense prompts Jesus to say still more. We
hear: "All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one
knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the
Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him". [75]

<p>21. That which during the theophany at the Jordan came so to speak "from
outside", from on high, here comes "from within", that is to say from the
depths of who Jesus is. It is another revelation of the Father and the
Son, united in the Holy Spirit. Jesus speaks only of the fatherhood of
God and of his own sonship he does not speak directly of the Spirit who
is Love and thereby the union of the Father and the Son. Nonetheless what
he says of the Father and of himself-the Son flows from that fullness of
the Spirit which is in him, which fills his heart, pervades his own "I ",
inspires and enlivens his action from the depths. Hence that "rejoicing
in the Holy Spirit". The union of Christ with the Holy Spirit, a union of
which he is perfectly aware, is expressed in that "rejoicing", which in a
certain way renders "perceptible" its hidden source. Thus there is a
particular manifestation and rejoicing which is proper to the Son of Man,
the Christ-Messiah, whose humanity belongs to the person of the Son of
God, substantially one with the Holy Spirit in divinity.

<p>In the magnificent confession of the fatherhood of God, Jesus of Nazareth
also manifests himself, his divine "I": for he is the Son "of the same
substance", and therefore "no one knows who the Son is except the Father,
or who the Father is except the Son", that Son who "for us and for our
salvation" became man by the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of a
virgin whose name was Mary.

<p>22. It is thanks to Luke's narrative that we are brought closest to the
truth contained in the discourse in the Upper Room. Jesus of Nazareth,
"raised up" in the Holy Spirit, during this discourse and conversation
presents himself as the one who "brings" the Spirit, as the one who is to
bring him and "give" him to the Apostles and to the Church at the price
of this own "departure" through the Cross.

<p>The verb "bring" is here used to mean first of all "reveal". In the Old
Testament, from the Book of Genesis onwards, the Spirit of God was in
some way made known, in the first place as a "breath" of God which gives
life, as a supernatural "living breath". In the Book of Isaiah, he is
presented as a "gift" for the person of the Messiah, as the one who comes
down and rests upon him, in order to guide from within all the salvific
activity of the "Anointed One". At the Jordan, Isaiah's proclamation is
given a concrete form: Jesus of Nazareth is the one who comes in the Holy
Spirit and who brings the Spirit as the gift proper to his own Person, in
order to distribute that gift by means of this humanity "He will baptize
you with the Holy Spirit". [76] In the Gospel of Luke, this revelation of
the Holy Spirit is confirmed and added to, as the intimate source of the
life and messianic activity of Jesus Christ.

<p>In the light of what Jesus says in the farewell discourse in the Upper
Room, the Holy Spirit is revealed in a new and fuller way. He is not only
the gift to the person (the person of the Messiah), but is a Person-gift.
Jesus foretells his coming as that of "another Counsellor" who, being
the Spirit of truth, will lead the Apostles and the Church "into all the
truth". [77] This will be accomplished by reason of the particular
communion between the Holy Spirit and Christ: "He will take what is mine
and declare it to you". [78] This communion has its original source in the
Father: "All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will
take what is mine and declare it to you". [79] Coming from the Father the
Holy Spirit is sent by the Father. [80] The Holy Spirit is first sent as a
gift for the Son who was made man, in order to fulfill the messianic
prophecies. After the "departure" of Christ the Son, the Johannine text
says that the Holy Spirit "will come" directly (it is his new mission),
to complete the work of the Son. Thus it will be he who brings to
fulfilment the new era of the history of salvation.

<p>23. We find ourselves on the threshold of the Paschal events. The new,
definitive revelation of the Holy Spirit as a Person Who is the gift is
accomplished at this precise moment. The Paschal events -- the Passion,
Death and Resurrection of Christ -- are also the time of the new coming of
the Holy Spirit, as the Paraclete and the Spirit of truth. They are the
time of the "new beginning" of the self-communication of the Triune God
to humanity in the Holy Spirit through the work of Christ the Redeemer.
This new beginning is the Redemption of the world: "God so loved the
world that he gave his only Son". [81] Already the "giving" of the Son, the
gift of the Son, expresses the most profound essence of God who, as Love,
is the inexhaustible source of the giving of gifts. The gift made by the
Son completes the revelation and giving of the eternal love: the Holy
Spirit, who in the inscrutable depths of the divinity is a Person-gift,
through the work of the Son, that is to say by means of the Paschal
mystery, is given to the Apostles and to the Church in a new way, and
through them is given to humanity and the whole world.

<p>24. The definitive expression of this mystery is had on the day of the
Resurrection. On this day Jesus of Nazareth, "descended from David
according to the flesh", as the Apostle Paul writes, is "designated Son
of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection
from the dead". [82] It can be said therefore that the messianic "raising
up" of Christ in the Holy Spirit reaches its zenith in the Resurrection,
in which he reveals himself also as the Son of God, "full of power". And
this power, the sources Of which gush forth in the inscrutable
Trinitarian communion, is manifested, first of all, in the fact that the
Risen Christ does two things: on the one hand he fulfills God's promise
already expressed through the Prophet's words "A new heart I will give
you, and a new spirit I will put within you, . . . my spirit"; [83] and on
the other hand he fulfills his own promise made to the Apostles with the
words "If I go, I will send him to you". [84] It is he: the Spirit of
truth, the Paraclete sent by the Risen Christ to transform us into his
own risen image. [85]

<p>"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being
shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood
among them and said to them, 'Peace be with you'. When he had said this,
he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when
they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the
Father has sent me, even so I send you'. And when he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'". [86]

<p>All the details of this key-text of John's Gospel have their own
eloquence, especially if we read them in reference to the words spoken in
the same Upper Room at the beginning of the Paschal events. And now these
events -- the Triduum Sacrum of Jesus whom the Father consecrated with the
anointing and sent into the world -- reach their fulfilment. Christ, who
"gave up his spirit" on the Cross [87] as the Son of Man and the Lamb of
God, once risen goes to the Apostles "to breathe on them" with that power
spoken of in the Letter to the Romans. [88] The Lord's coming fills those
present with joy: "Your sorrow will turn into joy", [89] as he had already
promised them before his Passion. And above all there is fulfilled the
principal prediction of the farewell discourse: the Risen Christ, as it
were beginning a new creation, "brings" to the Apostles the Holy Spirit.
He brings him at the price of his own "departure": he gives them this
Spirit as it were through the wounds of his crucifixion: "He showed them
his hands and his side". It is in the power of this crucifixion that he
says to them: "Receive the Holy Spirit".

<p>Thus there is established a close link between the sending of the Son and
the sending of Holy Spirit. There is no sending of the Holy Spirit (after
original sin) without the Cross and the Resurrection: "If I do not go
away, the Counsellor will not come to you". [90] There is also established
a close link between the mission of the Holy Spirit and that of the Son
in the Redemption. The mission of the Son, in a certain sense, finds its
" fulfilment" in the Redemption. The mission of the Holy Spirit "draws
from" the Redemption: "He will take what is mine and declare it to
you". [91] The Redemption is totally carried out by the Son as the
Anointed One, who came and acted in the power of the Holy Spirit,
offering himself finally in sacrifice on the wood of the Cross. And this
Redemption is, at the same time, constantly carried out in human hearts
and minds -- in the history of the world -- by the Holy Spirit, who is the
"other Counsellor".

<p>25. "Having accomplished the work that the Father had entrusted to the
Son on earth (cf. Jn 17:4), on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was
sent to sanctify the Cburch for ever, so that believers might have access
to the Father through Christ in one Spirit (cf. Eph 2:18). He is the
Spirit of life, the fountain of water springing up to eternal life (cf.
Jn 4:14; 7:38ff), the One through whom the Father restores life to those
who are dead through sin, until one day he will raise in Christ their
mortal bodies (cf. Rom 8: 10 f)". [92]

<p>In this way the Second Vatican Council speaks of the Church's birth on
the day of Pentecost. This event constitutes the definitive manifestation
of what had already been accomplished in the same Upper Room on Easter
Sunday. The Risen Christ came and "brought" to the Apostles the Holy
Spirit. He gave him to them, saying "Receive the Holy Spirit". What had
then taken place inside the Upper Room, "the doors being shut", later, on
the day of Pentecost is manifested also outside, in public. The doors of
the Upper Room are opened and the Apostles go to the inhabitants and the
piIgrims who had gathered in Jerusalem on the occasion of the feast, in
order to bear witness to Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit. In this
way the prediction is fulfilled: "He will bear witness to me: and you
also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the
beginning". [93]

<p>We read in another document of the Second Vatican Council: "Doubtless,
the Holy Spirit was already at work in the world before Christ was
glorified. Yet on the day of Pentecost, he carne down upon the disciples
to remain with them for ever. On that day the Church was publicly
revealed to the multitude, and the Gospel began to spread among the
nations by means of preaching ". [94]

<p>The era of the Church began with the "coming", that is to say with the
descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles gathered in the Upper Room in
Jerusalem, together with Mary, the Lord's Mother. [95] The time of the
Church began at the moment when the promises and predictions that so
explicitly referred to the Counsellor, the Spirit of truth, began to be
fulfilled in complete power and clarity upon the Apostles, thus
deterrnining the birth of the Church. The Acts of the Apostles speak of
this at length and in many passages, which state that in the rnind of the
first community, whose convictions Luke expresses, the Holy Spirit
assumed the invisible -- but in a certain way "perceptible" -- guidance of
those who after the departure of the Lord Jesus felt profoundly that they
had been left orphans. With the coming of the Spirit they felt capable of
fulfilling the mission entrusted to them. They felt full of strength. It
is precisely this that the Holy Spirit worked in them, and this is
continuaIly at work in the Church, through their successors. For the
grace of the Holy Spirit which the Apostles gave to their collaborators
through the imposition of hands continues to be transmitted in Episcopal
Ordination. The bishops in turn by the Sacrament of Orders render the
sacred ministers sharers in this spiritual gift and, through the
Sacrament of Confirmation, ensure that all who are reborn of water and
the Holy Spirit are strengthened by this gift. And thus, in a certain
way, the grace of Pentecost is perpetuated in the Church.

<p>As the Council writes, "the Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts
of the faithful as in a temple (cf. 1 Cor 3:16; 6:19). In them he prays
and bears witness to the fact that they are adopted sons (cf. Gal 4:6,
Rom 8:15-16.26) The Spirit guides the Church into the fullness of truth
(cf. Jn 16:13) and gives her a unity of fellowship and service. He
furnishes and directs her with various gifts, both hierarchical and
charismatic, and adorns her with the fruits ol his grace (cf. Eph
4:11-12; 1 Cor 12:4; Gal 5: 22). By the power of the Gospel he makes the
Church grow, perpetually renews her, and leads her to perfect union with
her Spouse". [96]

<p>26. These passages quoted from the Conciliar Constitution Lumen Gentium
tell us that the era of the Church began with the coming of the Holy
Spirit. They also tell us that this era, the era of tbe Church,
continues. It continues down the centuries and generations. In our own
century, when humanity is already close to the end of the second
Millennium after Christ, this era of the Church expressed itself in a
special way through the Second Vatican Council, as the Council of our
century. For we know that it was in a special way an "ecclesiological"
Council: a Council on the theme of the Church. At the same time, the
teaching of this Council is essentially "pneumatological": it is
permeated by the truth about the Holy Spirit, as the soul of the Church.
We can say that in its rich variety of teaching the Second Vatican
Council contains precisely all that "the Spirit says to the Churches" [97]
 with regard to the present phase of the history of salvation.

<p>Following the guidance of the Spirit of truth and bearing witness
together with hirn, the Council has given a special confirmation of the
presence of the Holy Spirit -- the Counsellor. In a certain sense, the
Council has made the Spirit newly "present" in our difficult age. In the
light of this conviction one grasps more clearly the great importance of
all the initiatives aimed at implementing the Second Vatican Council, its
teaching and its pastoral and ecumenical thrust. In this sense also the
subsequent Assemblies of the Synod of Bishops are to be carefully studied
and evaluated, aiming as they do to ensure that the fruits of truth and
love -- the authentic fruits of the Holy Spirit -- become a lasting treasure
for the People of God in its earthly pilgrimage down the centuries. This
work being done by the Church for the testing and bringing together of
the salvific fruits of the Spirit bestowed in the Council is something
indispensable. For this purpose one must learn how to "discern" them
carefully from everything that may instead come originally from the "
prince of this world". [98] This discernment in implementing the Council's
work is especially necessary in view of the fact that the Council opened
itself widely to the contemporary world, as is clearly seen from the
important Conciliar Constitutions Gaudium et Spes and Lumen Gentium.

<p>We read in the Pastoral Constitution: "For theirs (i.e. of the disciples
of Christ) is a community composed of men. United in Christ, they are led
by the Holy Spirit in their journey to the kingdom of their Father and
they have welcomed the news of salvation which is meant for every man.
That is why this community realizes that is is truly and intimately
linked with mankind and its history". [99] "The Church truly knows that
only God, whom she serves, meets the deepest longings of the human heart,
which is never fully satisfied by what the world has to offer". [100]
 "God's Spirit . . . with a marvellous providence directs the unfolding of
time and renews the face of the earth". [101]

<p>27. When Jesus during the discourse in the Upper Room foretells the
coming of the Holy Spirit "at the price of" his own departure, and
promises "I will send him to you", in the very same context he adds "And
when he comes, he will convince the world concerning sin and
righteousness and judgment". [102] The same Counselor and Spirit of truth
who has been promised as the one who "will teach" and "bring to
remembrance", who "will bear witness", and "guide into all the truth", in
the words just quoted is foretold as the one who "will convince the world
concerning sin and righteousness and judgment."

<p>The context too seems significant. Jesus links this foretelling of the
Holy Spirit to the words indicating his "departure" through the Cross,
and indeed emphasizes the need for this departure: "It is to your
advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counsellor will
not come to you". [103]

<p>But what counts more is the explanation that Jesus himself adds to these
three words: sin, righteousness, judgment. For he says this: "He will
convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:
concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning
righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more;
concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged". [104] In
the mind of Jesus, sin righteousness and judgment have e very precise
meaning, different from the meaning that one might be inclined to
attribute to these words independently of the speaker's explanation. This
explanation also indicates how one is to understand the "convincing the
world" which is proper to the action of the Holy Spirit. Both the meaning
of the individual words and the fact that Jesus linked them together in
the same phrase are important here.

<p>"Sin", in this passage, means the incredulity that Jesus encountered
among "his own", beginning with the people of his own town of Nazareth.
Sin means the rejection of his mission, a rejection that will cause
people to condemn him to death. When he speaks next of "righteousness",
Jesus seems to have in mind that definitive justice, which the Father
will restore to him when he grants him the glory of the Resurrection and
Ascension into heaven: "I go to the Father". In its turn, and in the
context of "sin" and a righteousness" thus understood, "judgment" means
that the Spirit of truth will show the guilt of the "world" in condemning
Jesus to death on the Cross. Nevertheless, Christ did not come into the
world only to judge it and condemn it: he came to save it. [105] Convincing
about sin and righteousness has as its purpose the salvation of the
world, the salvation of men. Precisely this truth seems to be emphasized
by the assertion that "judgment" concerns only the "prince of this
world", Satan, the one who from the beginning has been exploiting the
work of creation against salvation, against the covenant and the union of
man with God: he is "already judged" from the start. If the
Spirit-Counsellor is to convince the world precisely concerning judgment,
it is in order to continue in the world the salvific work of Christ.

<p>28. Here we wish to concentrate our attention principally on this mission
of the Holy Spirit, which is "to convince the world concerning sin", but
at the same time respecting the general context of Jesus' words in the
Upper Room. The Holy Spirit, who takes from the Son the work of the
Redemption of the world, by this very fact takes the task of the salvific
"convincing of Sin". This convincing is in permanent reference to
"righteousness": that is to say to definitive salvation in God, to the
fulfillment of the economy that has as its centre the crucified and
glorified Christ. And this salvific economy of God in a certain sense
removes man from "judgment", that is from the damnation which has been
inflicted on the sin of Satan, "the prince of this world", the one who
because of his sin has become "the ruler of this world of darkness". [106]
 And here we see that, through this reference to "judgment", vast
horizons open up for understanding "sin" and also "righteousness". The
Holy Spirit, by showing sin against the background of Christ's Cross in
the economy of salvation (one could say "sin saved"), enables us to
understand how his mission is also "to convince" of the sin that has
already been definitively judged ("sin condemned").

<p>29. All the words uttered by the Redeemer in the Upper Room on the eve of
his Passion become part of the era of the Church: first of all, the words
about the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete and Spirit of truth. These words
become part of it in an ever new way, in every generation, in every age.
This is confirmed, as far as our own age is concerned, by the teaching of
the Second Vatican Council as a whole, and especially in the Pastoral
Constitution Gaudium et Spes. Many passages of this document indicate
clearly that the Council, by opening itself to the light of the Spirit of
truth, is seen to be the authentic depositary of the predictions and
promises made by Christ to the Apostles and to the Church in the farewell
discourse: in a particular way as the depositary of the predictions that
the Holy Spirit would "convince the world concerning sin and
righteousness and judgment".

<p>This is already indicated by the text in which the Council explains bow
it understands the "world": "The Council focuses its attention on the
world of men, the whole human family along with the sum of those
realities in the midst of which that family lives. It gazes upon the
world which is the theatre of man's history, and carries the marks of his
energies, his tragedies, and his triumphs; that world which the Christian
sees as created and sustained by its Maker's love, fallen indeed into the
bondage of sin, yet emancipated now by Christ. He was crucified and rose
again to break the stranglehold of personified Evil, so that this world
might be fashioned anew according to God's design and reach its
fulfillment". [107] This very rich text needs to be read in conjunction
with the other passages in the Constitution that seek to show with all
the realism of faith the situation of sin in the contemporary world and
that also seek to explain its essence, beginning from different points of
view. [108]

<p>When on the eve of the Passover Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit as the
one who "will convince the world concerning sin", on the one hand this
statement must be given the widest possible meaning, insofar as it
includes all the sin in the history of humanity. But on the other hand,
when Jesus explains that this sin consists in the fact that a they do not
believe in him ", this meaning seems to apply only to those who rejected
the messianic mission of the Son of Man and condemned him to death on the
Cross. But one can hardly fail to notice that this more "limited" and
historically specified meaning of sin expands, until it assumes a
universal dimension by reason of the universality of the Redemption,
accomplished through the Cross. The revelation of the mystery of the
Redemption opens the way to an understanding in which every sin wherever
and whenever committed has a reference to the Cross of Christ -- and
therefore indirectly also to the sin of those who "have not believed in
him", and who condemned Jesus Christ to death on the Cross.

<p>From this point of view we must return to the event of Pentecost.

<p>30. Christ's prophecies in the farewell discourse found their most exact
and direct confirmation on the day of Pentecost, in particular the
prediction which we are dealing with: "The Counsellor . . . will convince
the world oncerning Sin. On that day, the promised Holy Spirit came down
upon the Apostles gathered in prayer together with Mary the Mother of
Jesus, in the same Upper Room, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles:
"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance", [109] "thus bringing
back to unity the scattered races and offering to the Father the
first-fruits of all the nations". [110]

<p>The connection between Christ's prediction and this event is clear. We
perceive here the first and fundamental fulfillment of the promise of the
Paraclete. He comes, sent by the Father, "after" the departure of
Christ,at the price of" that departure. This is first a departure through
the Cross, and later, forty days after the Resurrection, through his
Ascension into heaven. Once more, at the moment of the Ascension, Jesus
orders the Apostles "not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the
promise of the Fathers; "but before many days you shall be baptized with
the Holy Spirit"; "but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has
come upon you; and you shall be witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judaea
and Samaria and to the end of the earth". [111]

<p>These last words contain an echo or reminder of the prediction made in
the Upper Room. And on the day of Pentecost this prediction is fulfilled
with total accuracy. Acting under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who
had been received by the Apostles while they were praying in the Upper
Room, Peter comes forwards and speaks before a multitude of people of
different languages, gathered for the feast. He proclaims what he
certainly would not have had the courage to say before: "Men of Israel,
 . . . Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and
wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst . . . this Jesus,
delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you
crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. But God raised him up,
having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to
be held by it". [112]

<p>Jesus had foretold and promised: "He will bear witness to me, . . . and you
also are my witnesses". In the first discourse of Peter in Jerusalem this
"witness" finds its clear beginning: it is the witness to Christ
crucified and risen. The witness of the Spirit-Paraclete and of the
Apostles. And in the very content of that first witness, the Spirit of
truth, through the lips of Peter, "convinces the world concerning sin":
first of all, concerning the sin which is the rejection of Christ even to
his condemnation to death, to death on the Cross on Golgotha. Similar
prodamations will be repeated, according to the text of the Acts of the
Apostles, on other occasions and in various places. [113]

<p>31. Beginning from this initial witness at Pentecost and for all future
time, the action of the Spirit of truth who "convinces the world
concerning the sin" of the rejection of Christ is linked inseparably with
the witness to be borne to the Paschal Mystery: the mystery ot the
Crucified and Risen One. And in this link the same "convincing concerning
sin" reveals its own saIvific dimension. For it is a "convincing" that
has its purpose not merely the accusation of the world and still less its
condemnation. Jesus Christ did not come into the world to judge it and
condemn it but to save it. [114] This is emphasized in this first
discourse, when Peter exclaims: "Let all the house of Israel therefore
know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus
whom you crucified". [115] And then, when those present ask Peter and the
Apostles: "Brethren, what shall we do?", this is Peter's answer: "Repent,
and be baptized every of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit". [116]

<p>In this way "convincing concerning sin" becomes at the same time a
convincing concerning the remission of sins, in the power of the Holy
Spirit. Peter in his discourse in Jerusalem calls people to conversion,
as Jesus called his listeners to conversion at the beginning of his
messianic activity. [117] Conversion requires convincing of sin; it
includes the interior judgment of the conscience, and this, being a proof
of the action of the Spirit of truth in man's inmost being, becomes at
the same time a new beginning of the bestowal of grace and love: "Receive
the Holy Spirit". [118] Thus in this "convincing concerning sin" we
discover a double gift: the gift of the truth of conscience and the gift
of the certainty of redemption. The Spirit of truth is the Counsellor.

<p>The convincing concerning sin, through the ministry of the apostolic
kerygma in the early Church, is referred -- under the impulse of the Spirit
poured out at Pentecost -- to the redemptive power of Christ crucified and
risen. Thus the promise concerning the Holy Spirit made before Easter is
fulfilled: "He will take what is mine and declare it to you". When
therefore, during the Pentecost event, Peter speaks of the sin of those
who "have not believed" [119] and have sent Jesus of Nazareth to an
ignominious death, he bears witness to victory over sin: a victory
achieved, in a certain sense, through the greatest sin that man could
commit: the killing of Jesus, the Son of God, consubstantial with the
Father! Similarly, the death of the Son of God conquers human death: "I
will be your death, O death," [120] as the sin of having crucified the Son
of God "conquers" human sin! That sin which was committed in Jerusalem on
Good Friday -- and also every human sin. For the greatest sin on man's part
is matched, in the heart of the Redeemer, by the oblation of supreme love
that conquers the evil of all the sins of man. On the basis of this
certainty the Church in the Roman liturgy does not hesitate to repeat
every year, at the Easter Vigil, "O happy fault!", in the deacon's
proclamation of the Resurrection when he sings the "Exsultet".

<p>32. However, no one but he himself, the Spirit of truth, can "convince
the world", man or the human conscience of this ineffable truth. He is
the Spirit who a searches even the depths of God". [121] Faced with the
mystery of sin we have to search "the depths of God" to their very depth.
It is not enough to search the human conscience, the intimate mystery of
man, but we have to penetrate the inner mystery of God, those "depths of
God" that are summarized thus: to the Father -- in the Son -- through the
Holy Spirit. It is precisely the Holy Spirit who: "searches" the "depths
of God, and from them draws God's response to man's sin. With this
response there closes the process of "convincing concerning sin", as the
event of Pentecost shows.

<p>By convincing the "world" concerning the sin of Golgotha, concerning the
death of the innocent Lamb, as happens on the day of Pentecost, the Holy
Spirit also convinces of every sin, committed in any place and at any
moment in human history: for he demonstrates its relationship with the
Cross of Christ. The "convincing" is the demonstration of the evil of
sin, of every sin, in relation to the Cross of Christ. Sin, shown in this
relationship, is recognized in the entire dimension of evil proper to it,
through the "mysterium iniquitatis" [122] which is hidden within it. Man
does not know this dimension -- he is absolutely ignorant of it apart from
the Cross of Christ. So he cannot be "convinced" of it except by the Holy
Spirit: the Spirit of truth, but who is also the Counsellor.

<p>For sin, shown in relation to the Cross of Christ, is at the same time
identified in the full dimension of the "mysterium pietatis", [123] as
indicated by the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et
Paenitentia. [124] Man is also absolutely ignorant of this dimension of
sin apart from the Cross of Christ. And he cannot be "convinced" of this
dimension either except by the Holy Spirit: the one who "searches the
depths of God".

<p>33. This is the dimension of sin that we find in the witness concerning
the beginning, commented on in the Book of Genesis. [125] It is the sin
that according to the revealed Word of God constitutes the principle and
root ot all the others. We find ourselves faced with the original reality
of sin in human history and at the same time in the whole of the economy
of salvation. It can be said that in this sin the "mysterium iniquitatis"
has its beginning, but it can also be said that this is the sin
concerning which the redemptive power of the "mysterium pietatis" becomes
particularly clear and efficacious. This is expressed by Saint Paul, when
he contrasts the "disobedience" of the first Adam with the "obedience"
of Christ, the second Adam: "Obedience unto death". [126]

<p>According to the witness concerning the beginning, sin in its original
reality takes place in man's will -- and conscience -- first of all as
"disobedience", that is, as opposition of the will of man to the will of
God. This original disobedience presupposes a rejection, or at least a
turning away from the truth contained in the Word of God, who creates the
world. This Word is the same Word who was "in the beginning with God",
who "was God", and without whom "nothing has been made of all that is",
since "the world was made through him". [127] He is the Word who is also
the eternal law, the source of every law which regulates the world and
especially human acts. When therefore on the eve of his Passion Jesus
Christ speaks of the sin of those who "do not believe in him", in these
words of his, full of sorrow, there is as it were a distant echo of that
sin which in its original form is obscurely inscribed in the mystery of
creation. For the one who is speaking is not only the Son of Man but the
one who is also "the first-born of all creation", "for in him all things
were created . . . through him and for him". [128] In the light of this truth
we can understand that the "disobedience" in the mystery of the beginning
presupposes in a certain sense the same "nonfaith", that same "they have
not believed", which will be repeated in the Paschal Mystery. As we have
said, it is a matter of a rejection or at least a turning away from the
truth contained in the Word of the Father. The rejection expresses itself
in practice as adisobediencer, in an act committed as an effect of the
temptation which comes from the "father of lies". [129] Therefore, at the
root of human sin is the lie which is a radical rejection ot the truth
contained in the Word of the Father, through whom is expressed the Ioving
omnipotence of the Creator: the omnipotence and also the love "of God the
Father, Creator of heaven and earth".

<p>34. "The Spirit of God", who according to the biblical description of
creation "was moving over the face of the water", [130] signifies the
same "Spirit who searches the depths of God": "searches the depths of
the Father and of the Word-Son in the mystery of creation. Not only is he
the direct witness of their mutual love from which creation derives, but
he himself is this love. He himself, as love, is the eternal uncreated
gift. In him is the source and the beginning of every giving of gifts to
creatures. The witness concerning the beginning, which we find in the
whole of Revelation, beginning with the Book of Genesis, is unanimous on
this point To create means to call into existence from nothing:
therefore, to create means to give existence. And if the visible world is
created for man, therefore the world is given to man. [131] And at the
same time that same man in his own humanity receives as a gift a special
"image and likeness" to God. This means not only rationality and freedom
as constitutive properties of human nature, but also, from the very
beginning, the capacity of having a personal relationship with God, as
"I" and "you", and therefore the capacity of having a covenant, which
will take place in God's salvific communication with man. Against the
background of the "image and likeness" of God, "the gift of the Spirit"
ultimately means a call to friendship, in which the transcendent "depths
of God" become in some way opened to participation on the part of man.
The Second Vatican Council teaches: "The invisible God out of the
abundance of his love speaks to men as friends and lives among them, so
that he may invite and take them into fellowship with himself". [132]

<p>35. The Spirit, therefore, who "searches everything, even the depths of
God", knows from the beginning "the secrets of man". [133] For this
reason he alone can fully "convince concerning the sin" that happened at
the beginning, that sin which is the root of all other sins and the
sources of man's sinfulness on earth, a source which never ceases to be
active. The Spirit of truth knows the original reality of the sin caused
in the will of man by the "father of lies", he who already "has been
judged". [134] The Holy Spirit therefore convinces the world of sin in
connection with this "judgment", but by constantly guiding toward the
"righteousness" that has been revealed to man together with the Cross of
Christ: through "obedience unto death". [135]

<p>Only the Holy Spirit can convince concerning the sin of the human
beginning, precisely he who is the love of the Father and of the Son, he
who is gift, whereas the sin of the human beginning consists in
untruthfulness and in the rejection of the gift and the love which
determine the beginning of the world and of man.

<p>36. According to the witness concerning the beginning which we find in
the Scriptures and in Tradition, after the first (and also more complete)
description in the Book of Genesis, sin in its original form is
understood as "disobedience" and this means simply and directly
transgression of a prohibition laid down by God. [136] But in the light of
the whole context it is also obvious that the ultimate roots of this
disobedience are to be sought in the whole real situation of man. Having
been called into existence, the human being -- man and woman -- is a
creature. The "image of God", consisting in rationality and freedom,
expresses the greatness and dignity of the human subject, who is a
person. But this personal subject is also always a creature: in his
existence and essence he depends on the Creator. According to the Book of
Genesis, "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" was to express and
constantly remind man of the "limit" impassable for a created being.
God's prohibition is to be understood in this sense: the Creator forbids
man and woman to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil. The words of the enticement, that is to say the temptation, as
formulated in the sacred text, are an inducement to transgress this
prohibition -- that is to say to go beyond that "limit": "When you eat of
it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God ("like gods "),
knowing good and evil". [137]

<p>"Disobedience" means precisely going beyond that limit, which remains
impassable to the will and the freedom of man as a created being. For God
the Creator is the one definitive source of the moral order in the world
created by him. Man cannot decide by himself what is good and what is
evil -- cannot "know good and evil, like God". In the created world God
indeed remains the first and sovereign source for deciding about good and
evil, through the intimate truth of being, which is the reflection of the
Word, the eternal Son, consubstantial with the Father. To man, created to
the image of God, the Holy Spirit gives the gift of conscience, so that
in this conscience the image may faithfully reflect its model, which is
both Wisdom and eternal Law, the source of the moral order in man and in
the world. "Disobedience", as the original dimension of sin, means the
rejection of this source, through man's claim to become an independent
and exclusive source for deciding about good and evil. The Spirit who
"searches the depths of God", and who at the same time is for man the
light of conscience and the source of the moral order, knows in all its
fullness this dimension of the sin inscribed in the mystery of man's
beginning. And the Spirit does not cease "convincing the world of it" in
connection with the Cross of Christ on Golgotha.

<p>37. According to the witness of the beginning, God in creation has
revealed himself as omnipotence, which is love. At the same time he has
revealed to man that, as the "image and likeness" of his Creator, he is
called to participate in truth and love. This participation means a life
in union with God, who is "eternal life". [138] But man, under the
influence of the "father of lies", has separated himself from this
participation. To what degree? Certainly not to the degree of the sin of
a pure spirit, to the degree of the sin of Satan. The human spirit is
incapable of reaching such a degree. [139] In the very description given
in Genesis it is easy to see the difference of degree between the "breath
of evil" on the part of the one who "has sinned (or remains in sin) from
the beginning" [140] and already "has been judged", [141] and the evil of
disobedience on the part of man.

<p>Man's disobedience, nevertheless, always means a turning away from God,
and in a certain sense the closing up of human freedom in his regard. It
also means a certain opening of this freedom -- of the human mind and
will -- to the one who is the "father of lies". This act of conscious
choice is not only "disobedience" but also involves a certain consent to
the motivation which was contained in the first temptation to sin and
which is unceasingly renewed during the whole history of man on earth:
"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you
will be like God, knowing good and evil".

<p>Here we find ourselves at the very centre of what could be called the
"anti-Word", that is to say "the anti-truth". For the truth about man
becomes falsified: who man is and what are the impassable limits of his
being and freedom. This "anti-truth" is possible because at the same time
there is a complete falsification of the truth about who God is. God the
Creator is placed in a state of suspicion, indeed of accusation, in the
mind of the creature. For the first time in human history there appears
the perverse "genius of suspicion". He seeks to "falsify" Good itself,
the absolute Good, which precisely in the work of creation has manifested
itself as the Good which gives in an inexpressible way: as bonum
diffsivum sui, as creative love. Who can completely "convince concerning
sin", or concerning this motivation of man's original disobedience,
except the one who alone is the gift and the source of all giving of
gifts, except the Spirit, who "searches the depths of God" and is the
love of the Father and the Son".

<p>38. For in spite of all the witness of creation and of the salvific
economy inherent in it, the spirit of darkness [142] is capable of showing
God as an enemy of his own creature, and in the first place as an enemy
of man, as a source of danger and threat to man. In this way Satan
manages to sow in man's soul the seed of opposition to the one who "from
the beginning" would be considered as man's enemy -- and not as Father. Man
is challenged to become the adversary of God!

<p>The analysis of sin in its original dimension indicates that, through the
influence of the "father of lies", throughout the history of humanity
there will be a constant pressure on man to reject God, even to the point
of hating him: "Love of self to the point of contempt for God", as Saint
Augustine puts it. [143] Man will be inclined to see in God primarily a
limitation of himself, and not the source of his own freedom and the
fullness of good. We see this confirmed
in the modern age, when the atheistic ideologies seek to root out
religion on the grounds that religion causes the radical "alienation" of
man, as if man were dispossessed of his own humanity when, accepting the
idea of God, he attributes to God what belongs to man, and exclusively to
man! Hence a process of thought and historico-sociological practice in
which the rejection of God has reached the point of declaring his
"death". An absurdity, both in concept and expression! But the ideology
of the "death of God" is more a threat to man, as the Second Vatican
Council indicates when it analyzes the question of the "independence of
earthly affairs" and writes:a For without the Creator the creature would
disappear . . . when God is forgotten the creature itself grows
unintelligible". [144] The ideology of the "death of God" easily
demonstrates in its effects that on the "theoretical and practical"
levels it is the ideology of the "death of man".

<p>39. The Spirit who searches the depths of God was called by Jesus in his
discourse in the Upper Room the Paraclete. For from the beginning the
Spirit "is invoked" [145] in order to "convince the world concerning sin".
He is invoked in a definitive way through the Cross of Christ. Convincing
concerning sin means showing the evil that sin contains, and this is
equivalent to revealing the mystery of iniquity. It is not possible to
grasp the evil of sin in all its sad reality without "searching the
depths of God". From the very beginning, the obscure mystery of sin has
appeared in the world against the background of a reference to the
Creator of human freedom. Sin has appeared as an act of the will of the
creature-man contrary to the will of God, to the salvific will of God;
indeed, sin has appeared in opposition to the truth, on the basis of the
lie which has now been definitively "judged": the lie that has placed in
a state of accusation, a state of permanent suspicion, creative and
salvific love itself. Man has followed the "father of lies", setting
himself up in opposition to the Father of life and the Spirit of truth.

<p>Therefore, will not "convincing concerning sin" also have to mean
revealing suffering? Revealing the pain, unimaginable and inexpressible,
which on account of sin the Book of Genesis in its anthropomorphic vision
seems to glimpse in the "depths of God" and in a certain sense in the
very heart of the ineffable Trinity? The Church, taking her inspiration
from Revelation, believes and professes that sin is an offence against
God. What corresponds, in the inscrutable intimacy of the Father, the
Word and the Holy Spirit, to this aoffencen, this rejection of the Spirit
who is love and gift? The concept of God as the necessarily most perfect
being certainly excludes from God any pain deriving from deficiencies or
wounds; but in the a depths of God" there is a Father's love that, faced
with man's sin, in the language of the Bible reacts so deeply as to say:
"I am sorry that I have made him". [146] "The Lord saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth . . . And the Lord was sorry that he bad made
man on the earth . . . The Lord said: 'I am sorry that I have made them'
". [147] But more often the Sacred Book speaks to us of a Father who feels
compassion for man, as though sharing his pain. In a word, this
inscrutable and indescribable fatherly "pain" will bring about above all
the wonderful economy of redemptive love in Jesus Christ, so that through
the mysterium pietatis love can reveal itself in the history of man as
stronger than sin. So that the "gift" may prevail!

<p>The Holy Spirit who in the words of Jesus "convinces concerning sin is
the love of the Father and the Son, and as such is the Trinitarian gift,
and at the same time the eternal source of every divine giving of gifts
to creatures. Precisely in him we can picture as personified and
actualized in a transcendent way that mercy which the Patristic and
theological tradition, following the line of the Old and New Testaments,
attributes to God. In man, mercy includes sorrow and compassion for the
misfortunes of one's neighbor. In God, the Spirit-love expresses the
consideration of human sin in a fresh outpouring of salvific love. From
God, in the unity of the Father with the Son, the economy of salvation is
born, the economy which fills the history of man with the gifts of the
Redemption. Whereas sin, by rejecting love, has caused the "suffering" of
man which in some way has affected the whole of creation, [148] the Holy
Spirit will enter into human and cosmic suffering with a new outpouring
of love, which will redeem the world. And on the lips of Jesus the
Redeemer, in whose humanity the "suffering" of God is concretized, there
will be heard a word which manifests the eternal love full of mercy:
"Misereor". [149] Thus on the part of the Holy Spirit "convincing of sin"
becomes a manifestation before creation, which is "subjected to
futility", and above all in the depth of human consciences, that sin is
conquered through the sacrihce of the Lamb of God who has become even "
unto death" the obedient servant who, by making up for man's
disobedience, accomplishes the redemption of the world. In this way the
Spirit of truth, the Paraclete, "convinces concerning sin".

<p>40. The redemptive value of Christ's sacrifice is expressed in very
significant words by the author of the Letter to the Hebrews, who after
recalling the sacrifices of the Old Covenant in which "the blood of goats
and bulls . . ." purifies in "the flesh", adds: "How much more shall the
blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without
blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the
living God?". [150] Though we are aware of other possible interpretations,
our considerations on the presence of the Holy Spirit in the whole of
Christ's life lead us to see this text as an invitation to reflect on the
presence of the same Spirit also in the redemptive sacrifice of the
Incarnate Word.

<p>To begin with we reflect on the first words dealing with this sacrifice,
and then separately on the "purification of conscience" which it
accomplishes. For it is a sacrifice offered "through the eternal Spirit",
that "derives" from it the power to "convince concerning sin". It is the
same Holy Spirit, whom, according to the promise made in the Upper Room,
Jesus Christ "will bring" to the Apostles on the day of his Resurrection,
when he presents himself to them with the wounds of the crucifixion, and
whom "he will give" them "for the remission ot sins" "Receive the Holy
Spirit; if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven". [151]

<p>We know that "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power", as Simon Peter said in the house of the centurion
Cornelius. [152] We know of the Paschal Mystery of his "departure", from
the Gospel of John. The words of the Letter to the Hebrews now explain to
us how Christ "offered himself without blemish to God", and how he did
this "with an eternal Spirit". In the sacrifice of the Son of Man the
Holy Spirit is present and active just as he acted in Jesus' conception,
in his coming into the world, in his hidden life and in his public
ministry. According to the Letter to the Hebrews, on the way to his
"departure" through Gethsemani and Golgotha, the same Christ Jesus in his
own humanity opened himself totally to this action ot the
Spirit-Paraclete,who from suffering enables eternal salvific love to
spring forth. Therefore he "was heard for his godly fear. Although he was
a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered". [153] In this way
this Letter shows how humanity, subjected to sin in the descendants of
the first Adam, in Jesus Christ became perfectly subjected to God and
united to him, and at the same time full of compassion towards men. Thus
there is a new humanity, which in Jesus Christ through the suffering of
the Cross has returned to the love which was betrayed by Adam through
sin. This new humanity is discovered precisely in the divine source of
the original outpouring of gifts: in the Spirit, who "searches . . . the
depths of God" and is himself love and gift.

<p>The Son of God Jesus Christ, as man, in the ardent prayer of his Passion,
enabled the Holy Spirit, who had already penetrated the inmost depths of
his humanity, to transform that humanity into a perfect sacrifice through
the act of his death as the victim of love on the Cross. He made this
offering by himself. As the one priest, "he offered himself without
blemish to God". [154]

<p>In his humanity he was worthy to become this sacrifice, for he alone was
"without blemish" But he offered it "through the eternal Spirit", which
means that the Holy Spirit acted in a special way in this absolute
self-giving of the Son of Man, in order to transform this suffering into
redemptive love.

<p>41. The Old Testament on several occasions speaks of "fire from heaven"
which burnt the oblations presented by men. [155] By analogy one can say
that the Holy Spirit is the "fire from heaven" which works in the depth
of the mystery of the Cross. Proceeding from the Father, he directs
towards the Father the sacrifice of the Son, bringing it into the divine
reality of the Trinitarian communion. If sin caused suffering, now the
pain of God in Christ crucified acquires through the Holy Spirit its full
human expression. Thus there is a paradoxical mystery of love: in Christ
there suffers a God who has been rejected by his own creature: "They do
not believe in me!"; but at the same time, from the depth of this
suffering -- and indirectly from the depth of the very sin "of not having
believed" -- the Spirit draws a new measure of the gift made to man and to
creation from the beginning. In the depth of the mystery of the Cross
love is at work, that love which brings man back again to share in the
life that is in God himself.

<p>The Holy Spirit as Love and Gift comes down, in a certain sense, into the
very heart of the sacrifice which is offered on the Cross. Referring here
to the biblical tradition we can say: he consumes this sacrifice with the
fire of the love which unites the Son with the Father in the Trinitarian
communion. And since the sacrifice of the Cross is an act proper to
Christ, also in this sacrifice he "receives" the Holy Spirit. He receives
the Holy Spirit in such a way that afterwards and he alone with God the
Father -- can "give him" to the Apostles, to the Church, to humanity. He
alone "sends" the Spirit from the Father. [156] He alone presents himself
before the Apostles in the Upper Room, "breathes upon them" and says:
"Receive the Holy Spirit; if you forgive the sins of any, they are
forgiven", [157] as John the Baptist had foretold: "He will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire". [158] With those words of Jesus the
Holy Spirit is revealed and at the same time made present as the Love
that works in the depths of the Paschal Mystery, as the source of the
salvific power of the Cross of Christ, and as the gift of new and eternal
life.

<p>This truth about the Holy Spirit finds daily expression in the Roman
liturgy, when before Communion the priest pronounces those significant
words: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, by the will of the
Father and the work of the Holy Spirit your death brought life to the
world . . . ". And in the Third Eucharistic Prayer, referring to the same
salvific plan, the priest asks God that the Holy Spirit may "make us an
everlasting gift to you".

<p>42. We have said that, at the climax of the Paschal Mystery, the Holy
Spirit is definitively revealed and made present in a new way. The Risen
Christ says to the Apostles: "Receive the Holy Spirit". Thus the Holy
Spirit is revealed, for the words of Christ constitute the confirmation
of what he had promised and foretold during the discourse in the Upper
Room. And with this the Paraclete is also made present in a new way. In
fact, he was already at work from the beginning in the mystery of
creation and throughout the history of the Old Covenant of God with man.
His action was fully confirmed by the sending of the Son of Man as the
Messiah, who came in the power of the Holy Spirit. At the climax of
Jesus' messianic mission, the Holy Spirit becomes present in the Paschal
Mystery in all his divine subjectivity: as the one who is now to continue
the salvific work rooted in the sacrifice of the Cross. Of course Jesus
entNsts this work to humanity: to the Apostles, to the Church.
Nevertheless, in these men and through them the Holy Spirit remains the
transcendent principal agent of the accomplishment of this work in the
human spirit and in the history of the world: the invisible and at the
same time omnipresent Paraclete! The Spirit who "blows where he
wills". [159]

<p>The words of the Risen Christ on the a"first day of the week give
particular emphasis to the presence of the Paraclete-Counsellor as the
one who "convinces the world concerning sin, righteousness and judgment".
For it is only in this relationship that it is possible to explain the
words which Jesus directly relates to the "gift" of the Holy Spirit to
the Apostles. He says: "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins
of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are
retained". [160] Jesus confers on the Apostles the power to forgive sins,
so that they may pass it on to their successors in the Church. But this
power granted to men presupposes and includes the saving action of the
Holy Spirit. By becoming "the light of hearts", [161] that is to say the
light of consciences, the Holy Spirit "convinces concerning sin", which
is to say, he makes man realize his own evil and at the same time directs
him towards what is good. Thanks to the multiplicity of the Spirit's
gifts, by reason of which he is invoked as the "sevenfold one", every
kind of human sin can be reached by God's saving power. In reality -- as
Saint Bonaventure says -- "by virtue of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
all evils are destroyed and all good things are produced." [162]

<p>Thus the conversion of the human heart, which is an indispensable
condition for the forgiveness of sins, is brought about by the influence
of the Counsellor. Without a true conversion, which implies inner
contrition, and without a sincere and firm purpose of amendment, sins
remain "unforgiven", in the words of Jesus, and with him the Tradition of
the Old and New Covenants. For the first words uttered by Jesus at the
beginning of his ministry, according to the Gospel of Mark, are these:
"Repent, and believe in the Gospel". [163] A confirmation of this
exhortation is the "convincing concerning sin" that the Holy Spirit
undertakes in a new way by virtue of the Redemption accomplished by the
Blood of the Son of Man. Hence the Letter to the Hebrews says that this
"blood purifies the conscience". [164] It therefore, so to speak, opens to
the Holy Spirit the door into man's inmost being, namely into the
sanctuary of human consciences.

<p>43. The Second Vatican Council mentioned the Catholic teaching on
conscience when it spoke about man's vocation and in particular about the
dignity of the human person. It is precisely the conscience in particular
which determines this dignity. For the conscience is "the most secret
core and sanctuary of a man, where he is alone with God, whose voice
echoes in his depths". It "can . . . speak to his heart more specifically:
do this, shun that". This capacity to command what is good and to forbid
evil, placed in man by the Creator, is the main characteristic of the
personal subject. But at the same time, "in the depths of his conscience,
man detects a law which he does not impose upon himself, but which holds
him to obedience". [165] The conscience therefore is not an independent
and exclusive capacity to decide what is good and what is evil. Rather
there is profoundly imprinted upon it a principle of obedience visa-vis
the objective norm which establishes and conditions the correspondence of
its decisions with the commands and prohibitions which are at the basis
of human behavior, as from the passage of the Book of Genesis which we
have already considered. [166] Precisely in this sense the conscience is
the "secret sanctuary" in which "God's voice echoes". The conscience is
"the voice of God" even when man recognizes in it nothing more than the
principle of the moral order which it is not humanly possible to doubt,
even without any direct reference to the Creator. It is precisely in
reference to this that the conscience always finds its foundation and
justification.

<p>The Gospel's "convincing concerning sin" under the influence of the
Spirit of truth can be accomplished in man in no other way except through
the conscience. If the conscience is upright, it serves "to resolve
according to truth the moral problems which arise both in the life of
individuals and from social relationships "; then "persons and groups
turn aside from blind choice and try to be guided by the objective
standards of moral conduct" [167]

<p>A result of an upright conscience is, first of all, to call good and evil
by their proper name, as we read in the same Pastoral Constitution:
"Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder,
genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or willful self-destruction, whatever
violates the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, torments
inflicted on body or mind, attempts to coerce the will itself; whatever
insults human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary
imprisonment, deportation, slavery, prostitution, the selling of women
and children; as well as disgraceful working conditions, where people are
treated as mere tools for profit, rather than as free and responsible
persons"; and having called by name the many different sins that are so
frequent and widespread in our time, the Constitution adds "All these
things and others of their kind are infamies indeed. They poison human
society, but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who
suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a supreme dishonor to the
Creator" [168]

<p>By calling by their proper name the sins that most dishonor man, and by
showing that they are a moral evil that weighs negatively on any
balance-sheet of human progress, the Council also describes all this as a
stage in "a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and
darkness", which characterizes "all of human life, whether individual or
collective". [169] The 1983 Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on
reconciliation and penance specified even more clearly the personal and
social significance of human sin." [170]

<p>44. In the Upper Room, on the eve of his Passion and again on the evening
of Easter Day, Jesus Christ spoke of the Holy Spirit as the one who bears
witness that in human history sin continues to exist. Yet sin has been
subjected to the saving power of the Redemption. "Convincing the world
concerning sin" does not end with the fact that sin is called by its
right name and identified for what it is throughout its entire range. In
convincing the world concerning sin the Spirit of truth comes into
contact with the voice of human consciences.

<p>By following this path we come to a demonstration of the roots of sin,
which are to be found in man's inmost being, as described by the same
Pastoral Constitution: "The truth is that the imbalances under which the
modern world labours are linked with that more basic imbalance rooted in
the heart of man. For in man himself many elements wrestle with one
another. Thus, on the one hand, as a creature he experiences his
limitations in a multitude of ways. On the other, he feels himself tO be
boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life. Pulled by
manifold attractions, he is constantly forced to choose among them and to
renounce some. Indeed, as a weak and sinful being, he often does what he
would not, and fails to do what he woulds". [171] The Conciliar text is
here referring to the well-known words of Saint Paul. [172]

<p>The "convincing concerning sin" which accompanies the human conscience in
every careful reflection upon itself thus leads to the discovery of sin's
roots in man, as also to the discovery of the way in which the conscience
has been conditioned in the course of history. In this way we discover
that original reality of sin of which we have already spoken. The Holy
Spirit "convinces concerning sin" in relation to the mystery of man's
origins, showing the fact that man is a created being, and therefore in
complete ontological and ethical dependence upon the Creator. The Holy
Spirit reminds us, at the same time, of the hereditary sinfulness of
human nature. But the Holy Spirit the Counsellor "convinces concerning
sin" always in relation to the Cross of Christ. In the context of this
relationship Christianity rejects any "fatalism" regarding sin. As the
Council teaches: "A monumental struggle against the powers of darkness
pervades the whole history of man. The battle was joined from the very
origins of the world and will continue until the last day, as the Lord
has attested". [173] "But the Lord himself came to free and strengthen
man". [174] Man, therefore, far from allowing himself to be "ensnared" in
his sinful condition, by relying upon the voice of his own conscience "is
obliged to wrestle constantly if he is to cling to what is good. Nor can
he achieve his own interior integrity without valiant efforts and the
help of God's grave". [175] The Council rightly sees sin as a factor of
alienation which weighs heavily on man's personal and social life. But at
the same time it never tires of reminding us of the possibility of
victory.

<p>45. The Spirit of truth, who "convinces the world concerning sin", comes
into contact with that laborious effort on the part of the human
conscience which the Conciliar texts speak of so graphically. This
laborious effort of conscience also determines the paths of human
conversion: turning one's back on sin, in order to restore truth and love
in man's very heart. We know that recognizing evil in ourselves sometimes
demands a great effort. We know that conscience not only commands and
forbids but also judges in the light of interior dictates and
prohibitions. It is also the source of remorse: man suffers interiorly
because of the evil he has committed. Is not this suffering as it were a
distant echo of that "repentance at having created man" which in
anthropomorphic language the Sacred Book attributes to God? Is it not an
echo of that "reprobation" which is interiorized in the "heart" of the
Trinity and by virtue of the eternal love is translated into the
suffering of the Cross, into Christ's obedience unto death? When the
Spirit of truth permits the human conscience to share in that suffering
the suffering of the conscience becomes particularly profound, but also
particularly salvific. Then, by means of an act of perfect contrition,
the authentic conversion of the heart is accomplished: this is the
evangelical "metanoia".

<p>The laborious effort of the human heart, the laborious effort of the
conscience in which this "metanoia" or conversion takes place, is a
reflection of that process whereby reprobation is transformed into
salvific love, a love which is capable of suffering. The hidden giver of
this saving power is the Holy Spirit: he whom the Church calls "the light
of consciences" penetrates and fills a the depths of the human
heart", [176] Through just such a conversion in the Holy Spirit a person
becomes open to forgiveness, to the remission of sins. And in all this
wonderfuldynamism of conversion-forgiveness there is confirmed the truth
of what Saint Augustine writes concerning the mystery of man, when he
comments on the words of the Psalm: "The abyss calls to the abyss". [177]
 Precisely with regard to these "unfathomable depths" of man, of the
human conscience, the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit is
accomplished. The Holy Spirit "comes" by virtue of Christ's "departure"
in the Paschal Mystery: he comes in each concrete case of
conversion-forgiveness, by virtue of the sacrifice of the Cross. For in
this sacrifice "the blood of Christ . . . purifies your conscience from dead
works to serve the living God". [178] Thus there are continuously
fulfilled the words about the Holy Spirit as "another Counsellor", the
words spoken in the Upper Room to the Apostles and indirectly spoken to
everyone:"You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you". [179]

<p>46. Against the background of what has been said so far, certain other
words of Jesus, shocking and disturbing ones, become easier to
understand. We might call them the words of "unforgiveness". They are
reported for us by the Synoptic in connection with a particular sin which
is called "blasphemy against the Holy Spirit". This is how they are
reported in their three versions: Matthew: "Whoever says a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to
come". [180] Mark: "All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and
whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy
Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin". [181]
Luke: "Every one who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be
forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be
forgiven". [182]

<p>Why is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit unforgivable? How should this
blasphemy be understood? Saint Thomas Aquinas replies that it is a
question of a sin that is "unforgivable by its very nature, insofar as it
excludes the elements through which the forgiveness of sin takes
place. [183]

<p>According to such an exegesis, "blasphemy" does not properly consist in
offending against the Holy Spirit in words; it consists rather in the
refusal to accept the salvation which God offers to man through the Holy
Spirit, working through the power of the Cross. If man rejects the "
convincing concerning sin" which comes from the Holy Spirit and which has
the power to save, he also rejects the "coming" of the Counsellor -- that
"coming" which was accomplished in the Paschal Mystery, in union with the
redemptive power of Christ's Blood: the Blood which "purifies the
conscience from dead works".

<p>We know that the result of such a purification is the forgiveness of
sins. Therefore, whoever rejects the Spirit and the Blood remains in
"dead works", in sin. And the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit consists
precisely in the radical refusal to accept this forgiveness of which he
is the intimate giver and which presupposes the genuine conversion which
he brings about in the conscience. If Jesus says that blasphemy against
the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this life or in the next, it
is because this "non-forgiveness" is linked, as to its cause, to
"non-repentance", in other words to the radical refusal to be converted.
This means the refusal to come to the sources of Redemption, which
nevertheless remain "always" open in the economy of salvation in which
the mission of the Holy Spirit is accomplished. The Spirit has infinite
power to draw from these sources: "he will take what is mine", Jesus
said. In this way he brings to completion in human souls the work of the

<p>Redemption accomplished by Christ, and distributes its fruits. Blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit, then, is the sin committed by the person who
claims to have a "right" to persist in evil -- in any sin at all -- and who
thus rejects Redemption. One closes oneself up in sin, thus making
impossible one's conversion, and consequently the remission of sins,
which one considers not essential or not important for one's life. This
is a state of spiritual ruin, because blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
does not allow one to escape from one's self-imposed imprisonment and
open oneself to the divine sources of the purification of consciences and
of the remission of sins.

<p>47. The action of the Spirit of truth, which works towards the salvific
"convincing concerning sin", encounters in a person in this condition. an
interior resistance, as it were an impenetrability of conscience, a state
of mind which could be described as fixed by reason of a free choice.
This is what Sacred Scripture usually calls "hardness of heart". [184] In
our own time this attitude of mind and heart is perhaps reflected in the
loss of the sense of sin, to which the Apostolic Exhortation
Reconciliatio et Paenitentia devotes many pages. [185] Pope Pius XII had
already dedared that "the sin of the century is the loss of the sense of
sin", [186] and this loss goes hand in hand with the "loss of the sense of
God". In the Exhortation just mentioned we read: "In fact, God is the
origin and the supreme end of man, and man carries in himself a divine
seed. Hence it is the reality of God that reveals and illustrates the
mystery of man. It is therefore vain to hope that there will take root a
sense of sin against man and against human values, if there is no sense
of offence against God, namely the true sense of sin". [187]

<p>Hence the Church constantly implores from God the grace that integrity of
human consciences will not be lost, that their healthy sensitivity with
regard to good and evil will not be blunted. This integrity and
sensitivity are profoundly linked to the intimate action of the Spirit of
truth. In this light the exhortations of Saint Paul assume particular
eloquence: "Do not quench the Spirit"; "Do not grieve the Holy
Spirit". [188] But above all the Church constantly implores with the
greatest fervor that there will be no increase in the world of the sin
that the Gospel calls "blasphemy against the Holy Spirit". Rather, she
prays that it will decrease in human souls -- and consequently in the
forms and structures of society itself -- and that it will make room for
that openness of conscience necessary for the saving action of the Holy
Spirit. The Church prays that the dangerous sin against the Spirit will
give way to a holy readiness to accept his mission as the Counsellor,
when he comes to "convince the world concerning sin, and righteousness
and judgment".

<p>48. In his farewell discourse Jesus linked these three areas of
"convincing" as elements of the mission of the Paraclete: sin,
righteousness and judgment. They mark out the area of that mysterium
pietatis that in human history is opposed to sin, to the mystery of
iniquity. [189] On the one hand, as Saint Augustine says, there is "love
of self to the point of contempt of God"; on the other, "love of God to
the point of contempt of self". [190] The Church constantly lifts up her
prayer and renders her service in order that the history of consciences
and the history of societies in the great human family will now descend
towards the pole of sin, by the rejection of God's commandments "to the
point of contempt of God", but rather will rise towards the love in which
the Spirit that gives life is revealed.

<p>Those who let themselves be "convinced concerning sin" by the Holy
Spirit, also allow themselves to be convinced "concerning righteousness
and judgment". The Spirit of truth who helps human beings, human
consciences, to know the truth concerning sin, at the same time enables
them to know the truth about that righteousness which entered human
history in Jesus Christ. In this way, those who are "convinced concerning
sin" and who are converted through the action of the Counsellor are, in
a sense, led out of the range of the a judgment": that "judgment" by
which "the ruler of this world is judged". [191] In the depths of its
divine-human mystery, conversion means the breaking of every fetter by
which sin binds man to the whole of the mystery of iniquity. Those who
are converted, therefore, are led by the Holy Spirit out of the range of
the "judgment", and introduced into that righteousness which is in Christ
Jesus, and is in him precisely because he receives it from the
Father, [192] as a reflection of the holiness of the Trinity. This is the
righteousness of the Gospel and of the Redemption, the righteousness of
the Sermon on the Mount and of the Cross, which effects the purifying of
the conscience through the Blood of the Lamb. It is the righteousness
which the Father gives to the Son and to all those united with him in
truth and in love.

<p>In this righteousness the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father and the
Son, who "convinces the world concerning sin", reveals himself and makes
himself present in man as the Spirit of eternal life.

<p>49. The Church's mind and heart turn to the Holy Spirit as this twentieth
century draws to a close and the third Millennium since the coming of
Jesus Christ into the world approaches, and as we look towards the great
Jubilee with which the Church will celebrate the event. For according to
the computation of time this coming is measured as an event belonging to
the history of man on earth. The measurement of time in common use
defines years, centuries and millennia according to whether they come
before or after the birth of Christ. But it must also be remembered that
for us Christians this event indicates, as Saint Paul says, the "fullness
of time" [193] because in it human history has been wholly permeated by the
"measurement" of God himself: a transcendent presence of the "eternal
now". He who is, who was, and who is to come"; he who is "the Alpha and
the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end". [194] "For
God so Loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes
in him should not perish but have eternal life". [195] "When the time had
fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman . . . so that we might
receive adoption as sons". [196] And this Incarnation of the Son-Word came
about "by the power of the Holy Spirit".

<p>The two Evangelists to whom we owe the narrative of the birth and infancy
of Jesus of Nazareth express themselves on this matter in an identical
way. According to Luke, at the Annunciation of the birth of Jesus, Mary
asks: "How shall this be, since I have no husband?", and she receives
this answer: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the
Most High will overshadow you: therefore the child to be born will be
called holy, the Son of God. [197]

<p>Matthew narrates directly: "Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in
this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they
came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit" [198]
 Disturbed by this turn of events, Joseph receives the following
explanation in a dream: "Do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that
which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and
you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their
sins." [199]

<p>Thus from the beginning the Church confesses the mystery of the
Incarnation, this key mystery of the faith, by making reference to the
Holy Spirit. The Apostles' Creed says: "He was conceived by the power of
the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary". Similarly, the
Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed professes: "By the power of the Holy
Spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man".

<p>"By the power of the Holy Spirit" there became man he whom the Church, in
the words of the same Creed, professes to be the Son, of the same
substance as the Father: "God from God, Light from Light, true God from
true God, begotten, not made". He was made man by becoming "incarnate
from the Virgin Mary". This is what happened when "the fullness of time
had come".

<p>50. The great Jubilee at the close of the second Millennium, for which
the Church is already preparing, has a directly Christological aspect:
for it is a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. At the same time it
has a pneumatological aspect, since the mystery of the Incarnation was
accomplished "by the power of the Holy Spirit". It was "brought about" by
that Spirit -- consubstantial with the Father and the Son -- who, in the
absolute mystery of the Triune God, is the Person-love, the uncreated
gift, who is the eternal source of every gift that comes from God in the
order of creation, the direct principle and, in a certain sense, the
subject of God's self-communication in the order of grace. The mystery of
the Incarnation constitutes the climax of this giving, this divine self
communication.

<p>The conception and birth of Jesus Christ are in fact the greatest work
accomplished by the Holy Spirit in the history of creation and salvation:
the supreme grace "the grace of union", source of every other grace, as
Saint Thomas explains. [200] The great Jubilee refers to this work and
also -- if we penetrate its depths to the author of this work, to the
person of the Holy Spirit.

<p>For the "fullness of time" is matched by a particular fullness of the
self-communication of the Triune God in the Holy Spirit. "By the power of
the Holy Spirit" the mystery of the "hypostatic union" is brought
about -- that is, the union of the divine nature and the human nature, of
the divinity and the humanity in the one Person of the Word-Son. When at
the moment of the Annunciation Mary utters her fiat": "Be it done unto me
according to your word", [201] she conceives in a virginal way a man, the
Son of Man, who is the Son of God. By means of this "humanization" of the
Word-Son the self-communication of God reaches its defnitive fullness in
the history of creation and salvation. This fullness acquires a special
wealth and expressiveness in the text of John's Gospel: "The Word became
flesh". [202] The Incarnation of God the Son signifies the taking up into
unity with God not only of human nature, but in this human nature, in a
sense, of everything that is "flesh": the whole of humanity, the entire
visible and material world. The Incarnation, then, also has a cosmic
significance, a cosmic dimension. The "first-born of all creation, [203]
 becoming incarnate in the individual humanity of Christ, unites himself
in someway with the entire reality of man, which is also "flesh" [204]
 -- and in this reality with all "flesh", with the whole of creation.

<p>All this is accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit, and so is part
of the great Jubilee to come. The Church cannot prepare for the Jubilee
in any other way than in the Holy Spirit. What was accomplished by the
power of the Holy Spirit "in the fullness of time" can only through the
Spirit's power now emerge from the memory of the Church. By his power it
can be made present in the new phase of man's history on earth: the year
2000 from the birth of Christ.

<p>The Holy Spirit, who with his power overshadowed the virginal body of
Mary, bringing about in her the beginning of her divine Motherhood, at
the same time made her heart perfectly obedient to that
self-communication of God which surpassed every human idea and faculty.
"Blessed is she who believed!": [205] thus Mary is greeted by her cousin
Elizabeth, herself "full of the Holy Spirit". [206] In the words of
greeting addressed to her "who believed" we seem to detect a distant (but
in fact very close) contrast with all those about whom Christ will say
that "they do not believe ". [207] Mary entered the history of the
salvation of the world through the obedience of faith. And faith, in its
deepest essence, is the openness of the human heart to the gift: to God's
self-communication in the Holy Spirit. Saint Paul writes: "The Lord is
the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom". [208]

<p>When the Triune God opens himself to man in the Holy Spirit, this
opening of God reveals and also gives to the human creature the fullness
of freedom. This fullness was manifested in a sublime way precisely
through the faith of Mary, through the "obedience of faith": [209] truly,
"Blessed is she who believed"!

<p>52. In the mystery of the Incarnation the work of the Spirit "who gives
life" reaches its highest point. It is not possible to give life, which
in its fullest form is in God, except by making it the life of a Man, as
Christ is in his humanity endowed with personhood by the Word in the
hypostatic union. And at the same time, with the mystery of the
Incarnation there opens in a new way the source of this divine life in
the history of mankind: the Holy Spirit. The Word, "the first-born of all
creation, becomes "the first-born of many brethren". [210] And thus he also
becomes the head of the Body which is the Church, which will be born on
the Cross and revealed on the day of Pentecost -- and in the Church, he
becomes the head of humanity: of the people of every nation, every race,
every country and culture, every language and continent, all called to
salvation. "The Word became flesh, (that Word in whom) was life and the
life was the light of men . . . to all who received him he gave the power to
become the children of God". [211] But all this was accomplished and is
unceasingly accomplished "by the power of the Holy Spirit".

<p>For as Saint Paul teaches, "all who are led by the Spirit of God" are
"children of God". [212] The filiation of divine adoption is born in man
on the basis of the mystery of the Incarnation, therefore through Christ
the eternal Son. But the birth, or rebirth) happens when God the Father
"sends the Spirit of his Son into our hearts" [213]. Then "we receive a
spirit of adopted sons by which we cry 'Abba, Father!'". [214] Hence the
divine filiation planted in the human soul through sanctifying grace is
the work of the Holy Spirit. "It is the Spirit himself bearing witness
with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs,
heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ". [215] Sanctifying grace is the
principle and source of man's new life: divine, supernatural life.

<p>The giving of this new life is as it were God's definitive answer to the
Psalmist's words which in a way echo the voice of all creatures: "When
you send forth your Spirit, they shall be created; and you shall renew
the face of the earth". [216] He who in the mystery of creation gives life
to man and the cosmos in its many different forms, visible and invisible,
again renews this life through the mystery of the Incarnation. Creation
is thus completed by the Incarnation and since that moment is permeated
by the powers of the Redemption, powers which fill humanity and all
creation. This is what we are told by Saint Paul, whose cosmic and
theological vision seems to repeat the words of the ancient Psalm:
creation awaits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God
", [217] that is, those whom God has "foreknown" and whom he "has
predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son". [218] Thus there is
a supernatural "adoption", of which the source is the Holy Spirit, love
and gift. As such he is given to man. And in the superabundance of the
untreated gift there begins in the heart of all human beings that
particular created gift whereby they "become partakers of the divine
nature." [219] Thus human life becomes permeated, through participation,
by the divine life, and itself acquires a divine, supernatural dimension.
There is granted the new life, in which as a sharer in the mystery of
Incarnation a man has access to the Father in the Holy Spirit". [220] Thus
there is a close relationship between the Spirit who gives life and
sanctifying grace and the manifold supernatural vitality which derives
from it in man: between the uncreated Spirit and the created human spirit.

<p>53. All this may be said to fall within the scope of the great Jubilee
mentioned above. For we must go beyond the historical dimension of the
event considered in its surface value. Through the Christological content
of the event we have to reach the pneumatological dimension, seeing with
the eyes of faith the two thousand years of the action ot the Spirit of
truth, who down the centuries has drawn from the treasures of the
Redemption achieved by Christ and given new life to human beings,
bringing about in them adoption in the only begotten Son, sanctifying
them, so that they can repeat with Saint Paul: "We have received . . . the
Spirit which is from God". [221]

<p>But as we follow this reason for the Jubilee, we cannot limit ourselves
to the two thousand years which have passed since the birth of Christ. We
need to go further back, to embrace the whole of the action of the Holy
Spirit even before Christ -- from the beginning, throughout the world, and
especially in the economy of the Old Covenant. For this action has been
exercised, in every place and at every time, indeed in every individual,
according to the eternal plan of salvation, whereby this action was to be
closely linked with the mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption, which
in its turn exercised its influence on those who believed in the future
coming of Christ. This is attested to especially in the Letter to the
Ephesians. [222] Grace, therefore, bears within itself both a
Christological aspect and a pneumatological one, which becomes evident
above all in those who expressly accept Christ: "In him (in Christ)
you . . . were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, which is the guarantee
of our inheritance, until we acquire possession of it". [223]

<p>But, still within the perspective of the great Jubilee, we need to look
further and go further afield, knowing that "the wind blows where it
wills", according to the image used by Jesus in his conversation with
Nicodemus. [224] The Second Vatican Council, centered primarily on the
theme of the Church, reminds us of the Holy Spirit's activity also
"outside the visible body of the Church". The Council speaks precisely of
"all people of good will in whose hearts grace works in an unseen way.
For, since Christ died for all, and since the ultimate vocation of man is
in fact one, and divine, we ought to believe that the Holy Spirit in a
manner known only to God offers to every man the possibility of being
associated with this Pascal mystery". [225]

<p>54. "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and
truth". [226] These words were spoken by Jesus in another conversation,
the one with the Samaritan woman. The great Jubilee to be celebrated at
the end of this Millennium and at the beginning of the next ought to
constitute a powerful call to all those who "worship God in spirit and
truth". It should be for everyone a special occasion for meditating on
the mystery of the Triune God, who in himself is wholly transcendent with
regard to the world, especially the visible world. For he is absolute
Spirit, "God is spirit"; [227] and also, in such a marvelous way, he is
not only close to this world but present in it, and in a sense immanent,
penetrating it and giving it life from within. This is especially true in
relation to man: God is present in the intimacy of man's being, in his
mind, conscience and heart: an ontological and psychological reality, in
considering which Saint Augustine said of God that he was "closer than my
inmost being". [228] These words help us to understand better the words of
Jesus to the Samaritan woman: "God is spirit". Only the Spirit can be
"closer than my inmost being", both in my existence and in my spiritual
experience. Only the Spirit can be so immanent in man and in the world,
while remaining inviolable and immutable in his absolute transcendence.

<p>But in Jesus Christ the divine presence in the world and in man has been
made manifest in a new way and in visible form. In him "the grace of God
has appeared indeed". [229] The love of God the Father, as a gift,
infinite grace, source of life, has been made visible in Christ, and in
his humanity that love has become "part" of the universe, the human
family and history This appearing of grace in human history, through
Jesus Christ, has been accomplished through the power of the Holy Spirit,
who is the source of all God's salvific activity in the world: he, the
"hidden God", [230] who as love and gift "fills the universe". [231] The
Church's entire life, as will appear in the great Jubilee, means going to
meet the invisible God, the hidden God: a meeting with the Spirit "who
gives life".

<p>55. Unfortunately, the history of salvation shows that God's coming close
and making himself present to man and the world, that marvelous
"condescension" of the Spirit, meets with resistance and opposition in
our human reality. How eloquent from this point of view are the prophetic
words of the old man Simeon who inspired by the Spirit, came to the
Temple in Jerusalem, in order to foretell in the presence of the new-born
Babe of Bethlehem that he "is set for the fall and rising of many in
Israel, for a sign of contradiction". [232] Opposition to God, who is an
invisible Spirit, to a certain degree originates in the very fact of the
radical difference of the world from God, that is to say in the world's
"visibility" and "materiality" in contrast to him who is "invisible" and
"absolute Spirit"; from the world's essential and inevitable imperfection
in contrast to him, the perfect being. But this opposition becomes
conflict and rebellion on the ethical plane by reason of that sin which
takes possession of the human heart, wherein "the desires of the flesh
are against the Spirit and the desires of the Spirit are against the
flesh". [233] Concerning this sin, the Holy Spirit must "convince the
world" as we have already said.

<p>It is Saint Paul who describes in a particularly eloquent way the tension
and struggle that trouble the human heart. We read in the Letter to the
Galatians: "But I say, walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires
of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and
the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to
each other, to prevent you from doing what you would". [234] There already
exists in man, as a being made up of body and spirit, a certain tension,
a certain struggle of tendencies between the "spirit" and the "flesh".
But this struggle in fact belongs to the heritage of sin, is a
consequence of sin and at the same time a confirmation of it. This is
part of everyday experience. As the Apostle writes: "Now the works of the
flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness . . . drunkenness,
carousing and the like". These are the sins that could be called
"carnal". But he also adds others: "Enmity, strife, jealousy, anger,
selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy". [235] All of this
constitutes the "works of the flesh".

<p>But with these works, which are undoubtedly evil, Paul contrasts "the
fruit of the Spirit ", such as "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control". [236] From the context
it is clear that for the Apostle it is not a question of discriminating
against and condemning the body, which with the spiritual soul
constitutes man's nature and personal subjectivity. Rather, he is
concerned with the morally good or bad works, or better the permanent
dispositions -- virtues and vices -- which are the fruit of submission to (in
the first case) or of resistance to (in the second case) the saving
action of the Holy Spirit. Consequently the Apostle writes: "If we live
by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit". [237] And in other
passages: "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on
the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set
their minds on the things of the Spirit"; "You are in the Spirit, if in
fact the Spirit of God dwells in you". [238] The contrast that Saint Paul
makes between life "according to the Spirit and life "according to the
flesh" gives rise to a further contrast: that between "life" and "death".
"To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit
is life and peace"; hence the warning: "For if you live according to the
flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of
the body you will live". [239]

<p>Properly understood, this is an exhortation to live in the truth, that
is, according to the dictates of an upright conscience, and at the same
time it is a profession of faith in the Spirit of truth as the one who
gives life. For the body is "dead because of sin, but your spirits are
alive because of righteousness". "So then, brethren, we are debtors, not
to the flesh, to live according to the flesh". [240] Rather we are debtors
to Christ, who in the Paschal Mystery has effected our justification,
obtaining for us the Holy Spirit: "Indeed, we have been bought at a great
price". [241]

<p>In the texts of Saint Paul there is a superimposing -- and a mutual
compenetration -- ofthe ontological dimension (the flesh and the spirit)
the ethical (moral good and evil), and the pneumatological (the action of
the Holy Spirit in the order of grace). His words (especially in the
Letters to the Romans and Galatians) enable us to know and feel vividly
the strength of the tension and struggle going on in man between openness
to the action of the Holy Spirit and resistance and opposition to him, to
his saving gift. The terms or poles of contrast are, on man's part, his
limitation and sinfulness, which are essential elements of his
psychological and ethical reality; and on God's part, the mystery of the
gift, that unceasing self-giving of divine life in the Holy Spirit. Who
will win? The one who welcomes the gift.

<p>56. Unfortunately, the resistance to the Holy Spirit which Saint Paul
emphasizes in the interior and subjective dimension as tension, struggle
and rebellion taking place in the human heart finds in every period of
history and especially in the modern era its external dimension, which
takes concrete form as the content of culture and civilization, as a
philosophical system, an ideology, a programme for action and for the
shaping of human behavior. It reaches its clearest expression in
materialism, both in its theoretical form: as a system of thought, and in
its practical form: as a method of interpreting and evaluating facts, and
likewise as a programme of corresponding conduct. The system which has
developed most and carried to its extreme practical consequences this
form of thought, ideology and praxis is dialectical and historical
materialism, which is still recognized as the essential core of Marxism.

<p>In principle and in fact, materialism radically excludes the presence and
action of God, who is spirit, in the world and above all in man.
Fundamentally this is because it does not accept God's existence, being a
system that is essentially and systematically atheistic. This is the
striking phenomenon of our time: atheism, to which the Second Vatican
Council devoted some significant pages. [242] Even though it is not
possible to speak of atheism in a univocal way or to limit it exclusively
to the philosophy of materialism, since there exist numerous forms of
atheism and the word is perhaps often used in a wrong sense, nevertheless
it is certain that a true and proper materialism, understood as a theory
which explains reality and accepted as the key-principle of personal and
social action, is characteristically atheistic. The order of values and
the aims of action which it describes are strictly bound to a reading of
the whole of reality as "matter". Though it sometimes also speaks of the
"spirit" and of "questions of the spirit", as for example in the fields
of culture or morality, it does so only insofar as it considers certain
facts as derived from matter (epiphenomena), since according to this
system matter is the one and only form of being. It follows, according to
this interpretation, that religion can only be understood as a kind of
"idealistic illusion", to be fought with the most suitable means and
methods according to circumstances of time and place, in order to
eliminate it from society and from man's very heart.

<p>It can be said therefore that materialism is the systematic and logical
development of that "resistance" and opposition condemned by Saint Paul
with the words: "The desires of the flesh are against the Spirit". But,
as Saint Paul emphasizes in the second part of his aphorism, this
antagonism is mutual: "the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh".
Those who wish to live by the Spirit, accepting and corresponding to his
salvific activity, cannot but reject the internal and external tendencies
and claims of the "flesh", also in its ideological and historical
expression as anti-religious "materialism". Against this background so
characteristic of our time, in preparing for the great Jubilee we must
emphasize the "desires of the spirit", as exhortations echoing in the
night of a new time of advent, at the end of which, like two thousand
years ago, "every man will see the salvation of God". [243] This is a
possibility and a hope that the Church entrusts to the men and women of
today. She knows that the meeting or collision between the "desires
against the spirit" which mark so many aspects of contemporary
civilization, especially in some of its spheres, and "the desires
against the flesh", with God's approach to us, his Incarnation, his
constantly renewed communication of the Holy Spirit -- this meeting or
collision may in many cases be of a tragic nature and may perhaps lead to
fresh defeats for humanity. But the Church firmly believes that on God's
part there is always a salvific self-giving, a salvific coming and, in
some way or other, a salvific "convincing concerning sin" by the power of
the Spirit.

<p>57. The Pauline contrast between the "Spirit" and the "flesh" also
includes the contrast between "life" and "death". This is a serious
problem, and concerning it one must say at once that materialism, as a
system of thought, in all its forms, means the acceptance of death as the
definitive end of human existence. Everything that is material is
corruptible, and therefore the human body (insofar as it is "animal") is
mortal. If man in his essence is only "flesh", death remains for him an
impassable frontier and limit. Hence one can understand how it can be
said that human life is nothing but an "existence in order to die".

<p>It must be added that on the horizon of contemporary
civilization -- especially in the form that is most developed in the
technical and scientific sense -- the signs and symptoms of death have
become particularly present and frequent. One has only to think of the
arms race and of its inherent danger of nuclear self-destruction.
Moreover, everyone has become more and more aware of the grave situation
of vast areas of our planet, marked by death-dealing poverty and famine.
It is a question of problems that are not only economic but also and
above all ethical. But on the horizon of our era there are gathering ever
darker "signs of death": a custom has become widely established -- in some
places it threatens tO become almost an institution -- of taking the lives
of human beings even before they are born, or before they reach the
natural point of death. Furthermore, despite many noble efforts for
peace, new wars have broken out and are taking place, wars which destroy
the lives or the health of hundreds of thousands of people. And how can
one fail to mention the attacks against human life by terrorism,
organized even on an international scale?

<p> Unfortunately, this is only a partial and incomplete sketch of the
picture ot death being composed in our age, as we come ever closer to the
end of the second Millennium of the Christian era. Does there not rise up
a new and more or less conscious plea to the life-giving Spirit from the
dark shades of materialistic civilization, and especially from those
increasing signs of death in the sociological and historical picture in
which that civilization has been constructed? At any rate, even
independently of the measure of human hopes or despairs, and of the
illusions or deceptions deriving from the development of materialistic
systems of thought and life, there remains the Christian certainty that
the Spirit blows where he wills and that we possess "the first fruits of
the Spirit", and that therefore even though we may be subjected to the
sufferings of time that passes away, "we groan inwardly as we wait for . . .
the redemption of our bodies", [244] or of all our human essence, which is
bodily and spiritual. Yes, we groan, but in an expectation filled with
unflagging hope, because it is precisely this human being that God has
drawn near to, God who is Spirit. God the Father, a sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the
flesh". [245] At the culmination of the Paschal Mystery, the Son of God,
made man and crucified for the sins of the world, appeared in the midst
of his Apostles after the Resurrection, breathed on them and said
"Receive the Holy Spirit". This "breath" continues for ever, for "the
Spirit helps us in our weakness". [246]

<p>58. The mystery of the Resurrection and of Pentecost is proclaimed and
lived by the Church, which has inherited and which carries on the witness
of the Apostles about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. She is the
perennial witness to this victory over death which revealed the power of
the Holy Spirit and determined his new coming, his new presence in people
and in the world. For in Christ's Resurrection the Holy Spirit-Paraclete
revealed himself especially as he who gives life: "He who raised Christ
from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his
Spirit which dwells in you". [247] In the name of the Resurrection of
Christ the Church proclaims life, which manifested itself beyond the
limits of death, the life which is stronger than death. At the same time,
she proclaims him who gives this life: the Spirit, the Giver of Life; she
proclaims him and cooperates with him in giving life. For "although your
bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of
righteousness", [248] the righteousness accomplished by the Crucified and
Risen Christ. And in the name of Christ's Resurrection the Church serves
the life that comes from God himself, in close union with and humble
service to the Spirit.

<p>Precisely through this service man becomes in an ever new manner the "way
of the Church", as I said in the Encyclical on Christ the Redeemer [249]
 and as I now repeat in this present one on the Holy Spirit. United with
the Spirit, the Church is supremely aware of the reality of the inner
man, of what is deepest and most essential in man, because it is
spiritual and incorruptible. At this level the Spirit grafts the "root of
immortality", [250] from which the new life springs. This is man's life in
God, which, as a fruit of God's salvific self-communication in the Holy
Spirit, can develop and flourish only by the Spirit's action. Therefore
Saint Paul speaks to God on behalf of believers, to whom he declares "I
bow my knees before the Father . . . , that he may grant you . . . to be
strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man". [251]

<p> Under the infuence of the Holy Spirit this inner, "spiritual", man
matures and grows strong. Thanks to the divine self-communication, the
human spirit which "knows the secrets of man" meets the "Spirit who
searches everything, even the depths of God". [252] In this Spirit, who is
the eternal gift, the Triune God opens himself to man, to the human
spirit. The hidden breath of the divine Spirit enables the human spirit
to open in its turn before the saving and sanctifying self-opening of
God. Through the gift of grace, which comes from the Holy Spirit, man
enters a "new life", is brought into the supernatural reality of the
divine life itself and becomes a "dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit", a
living temple of God. [253] For through the Holy Spirit, the Father and
the Son come to him and take up their abode with him. [254] In the
communion of grace with the Trinity, man's "living area" is broadened and
raised up to the supernatural level of divine life. Man lives in God and
by God: he lives According to the Spirit", and "sets his mind on the
things of the Spirit".

<p>59. Man's intimate relationship with God in the Holy Spirit also enables
him to understand himself, his own humanity, in a new way. Thus that
image and likeness of God which man is from his very beginning is fully
realized. [255] This intimate truth of the human being has to be
continually rediscovered in the light of Christ, who is the prototype of
the relationship with God. There also has to be rediscovered in Christ
the reason for "full self-discovery through a sincere gift of himself" to
others, as the Second Vatican Council writes: precisely by reason of this
divine likeness which "shows that on earth man . . . is the only creature
that God wishes for himself" in his dignity as a person, but as one open
to integration and social communion. [256] The effective knowledge and
full implementation of this truth of his being come about only by the
power of the Holy Spirit. Man learns this truth from Jesus Christ and
puts it into practice in his own life by the power of the Spirit, whom
Jesus himself has given to us.

<p>Along this path -- the path of such an inner maturity, which includes the
full discovery of the meaning of humanity -- God comes close to man, and
permeates more and more completely the whole human world. The Triune God,
who "exists" in himself as a transcendent reality of interpersonal gift,
giving himself in the Holy Spirit as gift to man, transforms the human
world from within, from inside hearts and minds. Along this path the
world, made to share in the divine gift, becomes -- as the Council
teaches -- "ever more human, ever more profoundly human", [257] while within
the world, through people's hearts and minds, the Kingdom develops in
which God will be defnitively "all in all": [258] as gift and love. Gift
and love: this is the eternal power of the opening of the Triune God to
man and the world, in the Holy Spirit.

<p>As the year 2000 since the birth of Christ draws near, it is a question
of ensuring that an ever greater number of people "may fully find
themselves . . . through a sincere gift of self", according to the
expression of the Council already quoted. Through the action of the
Spirit-Paraclete, may there be accomplished in our world a process of
true growth in humanity, in both individual and community life. In this
regard Jesus himself "when he prayed to the Father, 'that all may be
one . . . as we are one' (Jn 17: 21-22) . . . implied a certain likeness
between the union of the divine persons and the union of the children of
God in truth and charity". [259] The Council repeats this truth about man,
and the Church sees in it a particularly strong and conclusive indication
of her own apostolic tasks. For if man is the way of the Church, this way
passes through the whole mystery of Christ, as man's divine model. Along
this way the Holy Spirit, strengthening in each of us "the inner man",
enables man ever more "fully to find himself through a sincere gift of
self". These words of the Pastoral Constitution of the Council can be
said to sum up the whole of Christian anthropology: that theory and
practice, based on the Gospel, in which man discovers himself as
belonging to Christ and discovers that in Christ he is raised to the
status of a child of God, and so understands better his own dignity as
man, precisely because he is the subject of God's approach and presence,
the subject of the divine condescension, which contains the prospect and
the very root of definitive glorification. Thus it can truly be said that
" the glory of God is the living man, yet man's life is the vision of
God": [260] man, living a divine life, is the glory of God, and the Holy
Spirit is the hidden dispenser of this life and this glory. The Holy
Spirit -- says the great Basil -- "while simple in essence and manifold in
his virtues . . . extends himself without undergoing any diminishing, is
present in each subject capable of receiving him as if he were the only
one, and gives grace which is sufficient for all". [261]

<p>60. When, under the influence of the Paraclete, people discover this
divine dimension of their being and life, both as individuals and as a
community, they are able to free themselves from the various determinisms
which derive mainly from the materialistic bases of thought, practice and
related modes of action. In our age these factors have succeeded in
penetrating into man's inmost being, into that sanctuary of the
conscience where the Holy Spirit continuously radiates the light and
strength of new life in the "freedom of the children of God". Man's
growth in this life is hindered by the conditionings and pressures
exerted upon him by dominating structures and mechanisms in the various
spheres of society. It can be said that in many cases social factors,
instead of fostering the development and expansion of the human spirit,
ultimately deprive the human spirit of the genuine truth of its being and
life -- over which the Holy Spirit keeps vigil -- in order to subject it to
the "prince of this world".

<p>The great Jubilee of the year 2000 thus contains a message of liberation
by the power of the Spirit, who alone can help individuals and
communities to free themselves from the old and new determinisms, by
guiding them with the "law of the Spirit, which gives life in Christ
Jesus", [262] and thereby discovering and accomplishing the full measure
of man's true freedom. For, as Samt Paul writes, "where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is freedom". [263] This revelation of freedom and hence of
man's true dignity acquires a particular eloquence for Christians and for
the Church in a state of persecution -- both in ancient times and in the
present -- because the witnesses to divine Truth then become a living proof
of the action of the Spirit of truth present in the hearts and minds of
the faithful, and they often mark with their own death by martyrdom the
supreme glorification of human dignity.

<p>Also in the ordinary conditions of society, Christians, as witnesses to
man's authentic dignity, by their obedience to the Holy Spirit contribute
to the manifold "renewal of the face of the earth", working together with
their brothers and sisters in order to achieve and put to good use
everything that is good, noble and beautiful in the modern progress of
civilization, culture, science, technology and the other areas of thought
and human activity. [264] They do this as disciples of Christ who -- as the
Council writes -- "appointed Lord by his Resurrection, . . . is now at work
in the hearts of men through the power of his Spirit. He arouses not only
a desire for the age to come but by that very fact, he animates, purifies
and strengthens those noble longings too by which the human family
strives to make its life more humane and to render the earth submissive
to this goal". [265] Thus they affirm still more strongly the greatness of
man, made in the image and likeness of God, a greatness shown by the
mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God, who "in the fullness of
time", by the power of the Holy Spirit, entered into history and
manifested himself as true man, he who was begotten before every
creature, "through whom are all things and through whom we exist". [266]

<p>61. As the end of the second Millennium approaches, an event which should
recall to everyone and as it were make present anew the coming of the
Word in the fullness of time, the Church once more means to ponder the
very essence of her divine-human constitution and of that mission which
enables her to share in the Messianic mission of Christ, according to the
teaching and the ever valid plan of the Second Vatican Council. Following
this line, we can go back to the Upper Room, where Jesus Christ reveals
the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, and where he
speaks of his own "departure" through the Cross as the necessary
condition for the Spirit's "coming": "It is to your advantage that I go
away, for if I do not go away, the Counsellor will not come to you; but
if I go, I will send him to you". [267] We have seen that this prediction
first came true the evening of Easter day and then during the celebration
of Pentecost in Jerusalem, and we have seen that ever since then it is
being fulfilled in human history through the Church.

<p>In the light of that prediction, we also grasp the full meaning of what
Jesus says, also at the Last Supper, about his new "coming". For it is
significant that in the same farewell discourse Jesus foretells not only
his "departure" but also his new "coming". His exact words are: "I will
not leave you desolate; I will come to you". [268] And at the moment of
his final farewell before he ascends into heaven, he will repeat even
more explicitly: "Lo, I am with you", and this "always, to the close of
the age". [269] This new "coming" of Christ, this continuous coming of
his, in order to be with his Apostles, with the Church, this "I am with
you always, to the close of the age", does not of course change the fact
of his "departure". It follows that departure, after the close of
Christ's messianic activity on earth, and it occurs in the context of the
predicted sending of the Holy Spirit and in a certain sense forms part of
his own mission. And yet it occurs by the power ot the Holy Spirit, who
makes it possible for Christ, who has gone away, to come now and for ever
in a new way. This new coming of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit,
and his constant presence and action in the spiritual life, are
accomplished in the sacramental reality. In this reality, Christ, who has
gone away in his visible humanity, comes, is present and acts in the
Church in such an intimate way as to make it his own Body. As such, the
Church lives, works and grows "to the close of the age". All this happens
through the power of the Holy Spirit.

<p>62. The most complete sacramental expression of the "departure" of Christ
through the mystery of the Cross and Resurrection is the Eucharist. In
every celebration of the Eucharist his coming, his salvific presence, is
sacramentally realized: in the Sacrifice and in Communion. It is
accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit, as part of his own
mission. [270] Through the Eucharist the Holy Spirit accomplishes that
"strengthening of the inner man" spoken of in the Letter to the
Ephesians. [271] Through the Eucharist, individuals and communities, by
the action of the Paraclete-Counsellor, learn to discover the divine
sense of human life, as spoken of by the Council: that sense whereby
Jesus Christ "fully reveals man to man himself", suggesting "a certain
likeness between the union of the divine persons, and the union of God's
children in truth and charity". [272] This union is expressed and made
real especially through the Eucharist, in which man shares in the
sacrifice of Christ which this celebration actualizes, and he also learns
to "find himself . . . through a . . . gift of himself" [273] through communion
with God and with others, his brothers and sisters.

<p>For this reason the early Christians, right from the days immediately
following the coming down of the Holy Spirit, "devoted themselves to the
breaking of bread and the prayers", and in this way they formed a
community united by the teaching of the Apostles. [274] Thus "they
recognized "that their Risen Lord, who had ascended into heaven, came
into their midst anew in that Eucharistic community of the Church and by
means of it. Guided by the Holy Spirit, the Church from the beginning
expressed and confirmed her identity through the Eucharist. And so it has
always been, in every Christian generation, down to our own time, down to
this present period when we await the end of the second Christian
Millennium. Of course, we unfortunately have to acknowledge the fact that
the Millennium which is about to end is the one in which there have
occurred the great separations between Christians. All believers in
Christ, therefore, following the example of the Apostles, must fervently
strive to conform their thinking and action to the will of the Holy
Spirit, "the principle of the Church's unity", [275] so that all who have
been baptized in the one Spirit in order to make up one body may be
brethren joined in the celebration of the same Eucharist, "a sacrament of
love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity!" [276]

<p>63. Christ's Eucharistic presence, his sacramental "I am with you",
enables the Church to discover ever more deeply her own mystery, as is
shown by the whole ecclesiology of the Second Vatican Council, whereby
"the Church is in Christ as a sacrament or sign and instrument of the
intimate union with God and of the unity of the whole human race". [277]
 As a sacrament, the Church is a development from the Paschal Mystery of
Christ's "departure", living by his ever new "coming" by the power of the
Holy Spirit, within the same mission of the ParacleteSpirit of truth.
Precisely this is the essential mystery of the Church, as the Council
professes.

<p>While it is through creation that God is he in whom we all alive and move
and have our being", [278] in its turn the power of the Redemption endures
and develops in the history of man and the world in a double "rhythm" as
it were, the source of which is found in the Eternal Father. On the one
hand there is the rhythm of the mission of the Son, who came into the
world and was born of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit;
and on the other hand there is also the rhythm of the mission of the Holy
Spirit, as he was revealed definitively by Christ. Through the
"departure" of the Son, the Holy Spirit came and continues to come as
Counsellor and Spirit of truth. And in the context of his mission, as it
were within the indivisible presence of the Holy Spirit, the Son, who
"had gone away" in the Paschal Mystery, "comes" and is continuously
present in the mystery of the Church, at times concealing himself and at
times revealing himself in her history, and always directing her steps.
All of this happens in a sacramental way, through the power of the Holy
Spirit, who, "drawing from the wealth of Christ's Redemption", constantly
gives life. As the Church becomes ever more aware of this mystery, she
sees herself more clearly, above all as a sacrament.

<p>This also happens because, by the will of her Lord, through the
individual sacraments the Church fulfils her salvific ministry to man.
This sacramental ministry, every time it is accomplished, brings with it
the mystery of the "departure" of Christ through the Cross and the
Resurrection, by virtue of which the Holy Spirit comes. He comes and
works: "he gives life". For the sacraments signify grace and confer
grace: They signify life and give life. The Church is the visible
dispenser of the sacred signs, while the Holy Spirit acts in them as the
invisible dispenser of the life which they signify. Together with the
Spirit, Christ Jesus is present and acting.

<p>64. If the Church is the sacrament of intimate union with God, she is
such in Jesus Ghrist, in whom this same union is accomplished as a
salvific reality. She is such in Jesus Christ, through the power of the
Holy Spirit. The fullness of the salvific reality, which is Christ in
history, extends in a sacramental way in the power of the
Spirit-Paraclete. In this way the Holy Spirit is "another Counsellor", or
new Counsellor, because through his action the Good News takes shape in
human minds and hearts and extends through history. In all of this it is
the Holy Spirit who gives life.

<p>When we use the word "sacrament" in reference to the Church, we must bear
in mind that in the texts of the Council the sacramentality of the Church
appears as distinct from the sacramentality that is proper, in the strict
sense, to the Sacraments. Thus we read: "The Church is . . . in the nature
of a sacrament -- a sign and instrument of communion with God". But what
matters and what emerges from the analogical sense in which the word is
used in the two cases is the relationship which the Church has with the
power of the Holy Spirit, who alone gives life: the Church is the sign
and instrument of the presence and action of the life-giving Spirit.

<p>Vatican II adds that the Church is "a sacrament . . . of the unity of all
mankind". Obviously it is a question of the unity which the human race
 -- which in itself is differentiated in various ways -- has from God and in
God. This unity has its roots in the mystery of creation and acquires a
new dimension in the mystery of the Redemption, which is ordered to
universal salvation. Since God "wishes all men to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of the truth", [279] the Redemption includes all humanity
and in a certain way all of creation. In the same universal dimension of
Redemption the Holy Spirit is acting, by virtue of the "departure of
Christ". Therefore the Church, rooted through her own mystery in the
Trinitarian plan of salvation, with good reason regards herself as the
"sacrament of the unity of the whole human race ". She knows that she is
such through the power of the Holy Spirit, of which power she is a sign
and instrument in the fulfillment of God's salvific plan.

<p>In this way the "condescension" of the infinite Trinitarian Love is
brought about: God, who is infinite spirit, comes close to the visible
world. The Triune God communicates himself to man in the Holy Spirit from
the beginning through his "image and likeness". Under the action of the
same Spirit, man, and through him the created world, which has been
redeemed by Christ, draw near to their ultimate destinies in God. The
Church is "a sacrament, that is sign and instrument" of this coming
together of the two poles of creation and redemption, God and man. She
strives to restore and strengthen the unity at the very roots of the
human race: in the relationship of communion that man has with God as his
Creator, Lord and Redeemer. This is a truth which on the basis of the
Council's teaching we can meditate on, explain and apply in all the
fullness of its meaning in this phase of transition from the second to
the third Christian Millennium. And we rejoice to realize ever more
clearly that within the work carried out by the Church in the history of
salvation, which is part of the history of humanity, the Holy Spirit is
present and at work -- he who with the breath of divine life permeates
man's earthly pilgrimage and causes all creation, all history, to flow
together to its ultimate end, in the infinite ocean of God.

<p>65. The breath of the divine life, the Holy Spirit, in its simplest and
most common manner, expresses itself and makes itself felt in prayer. It
is a beautiful and salutary thought that, wherever people are praying in
the world, there the Holy Spirit is, the living breath of prayer. It is a
beautiful and salutary thought to recognize that, if prayer is offered
throughout the world, in the past, in the present and in the future,
equally widespread is the presence and action of the Holy Spirit, who
"breathes" prayer in the heart of man in all the endless range of the
most varied situations and conditions, sometimes favorable and sometimes
unfavorable to the spiritual and religious life. Many times, through the
influence of the Spirit, prayer rises from the human heart in spite of
prohibitions and persecutions and even official proclamations regarding
the non-religious or even atheistic character of public life. Prayer
always remains the voice of all those who apparently have no voice -- and
in this voice there always echoes that "loud cry" attributed to Christ by
the Letter to the Hebrews. [280] Prayer is also the revelation of that
abyss which is the heart of man: a depth which comes from God and which
only God can fill,precisely with the Holy Spirit. We read in Luke: "If
you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
him!". [281]

<p>The Holy Spirit is the gift that comes into man's heart together with
prayer. In prayer he manifests himself first of all and above all as the
gift that "helps us in our weakness". This is the magnificent thought
developed by Saint Paul in the Letter to the Romans, when he writes: "For
we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes
for us with sighs too deep for words." [282] Therefore, the Holy Spirit
not only enables us to pray, but guides us "from within" in prayer: he is
present in our prayer and gives it a divine dimension. [283] Thus "he who
searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because
the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God". [284]
 Prayer through the power of the Holy Spirit becomes the ever more mature
expression of the new man, who by means of this prayer participates in
the divine life.

<p>Our diffcult age has a special need of prayer. In the course of
history -- both in the past and in the present -- many men and women have
borne witness to the importance of prayer by consecrating themselves to
the praise of God and to the life of prayer, especially in monasteries
and convents; so too recent years have been seeing a growth in the number
of people who, in evermore widespread movements and groups, are giving
first place to prayer and seeking in prayer a renewal of their spiritual
life. This is a significant and comforting sign, for from this experience
there is coming a real contribution to the revival of prayer among the
faithful, who have been helped to gain a clearer idea of the Holy Spirit
as he who inspires in hearts a profound yearning for holiness.

<p>In many individuals and many communities there is a growing awareness
that, even with all the rapid progress of technological and scientific
civilization, and despite the real conquests and goals attained, man is
threatened, humanity is threatened. In the face of this danger, and
indeed already experiencing the frightful reality of man's spiritual
decadence, individuals and whole communities, guided as it were by an
inner sense of faith, are seeking the strength to raise man up again, to
save him from himself, from his own errors and mistakes that often make
harmful his very conquests. And thus they are discovering prayer, in
which the a Spirit who helps us in our weakness" manifests himself. In
this way the times in which we are living are bringing the Holy Spirit
closer to the many who are returning to prayer. And I trust that all will
find in the teaching of this Encyclical nourishment for their interior
life, and that they will succeed in strengthening, under the action of
the Spirit, their commitment to prayer in harmony with the Church and her
Magisterium.

<p>66. In the midst of the problems, disappointments and hopes, desertions
and returns of these times of ours, the Church remains faithful to the
mystery of her birth. While it is an historical fact that the Church came
forth from the Upper Room on the day of Pentecost, in a certain sense one
can say that she has never left it. Spiritually the event of Pentecost
does not belong only to the past: the Church is always in the Upper Room
that she bears in her heart. The Church perseveres in prayer, like the
Apostles together with Mary, the Mother of Christ, and with those who in
Jerusalem were the first seed of the Christian community and who awaited
in prayer the coming of the Holy Spirit.

<p>The Church perseveres in prayer with Mary. This union of the praying
Church with the Mother of Christ has been part of the mystery of the
Church from the beginning: we see her present in this mystery as she is
present in the mystery of her Son. It is the Council that says to us "The
Blessed Virgin . . . , overshadowed by the Holy Spirit, . . . brought forth
. . . the Son . . . . he whom God placed as the first-born among many brethren
(cf. Rom 8: 29), namely the faith ful. In their birth and development she
cooperates with a maternal love"; she is through "his singular graces and
offices . . . intimately united with the Church . . . (she) is a model of the
Church". [285] "The Church, moreover, contemplating Mary's mysterious
sanctity, imitating her charity, . . . becomes herself a mother" and "herself
is a virgin, who keeps . . . the fidelity she has pledged to her Spouse.
Imitating the Mother of the Lord, and by the power of the Holy Spirit,
she preserves with virginal purity an integral faith, a firm hope, and a
sincere charity". [286]

<p>Thus one can understand the profound reason why the Church, united with
the Virgin Mother, prays unceasingly as the Bride to her divine Spouse,
as the words of the Book of Revelation, quoted by the Council, attest:
"The Spirit and the bride say to the Lord Jesus Christ: Come!". [287] The
Church's prayer is this unceasing invocation, in which "the Spirit
himself intercedes for us": in a certain sense, the Spirit himself utters
it with the Church and in the Church. For the Spirit is given to the
Church in order that through his power the whole community of the People
of God, however widely scattered and diverse, may persevere in hope: that
hope in which "we have been saved". [288] It is the eschatological hope,
the hope of definitive fulfilment in God, the hope of the eternal
Kingdom, that is brought about by participation in the life of the
Trinity. The Holy Spirit, given to the Apostles as the Counsellor, is the
guardian and animator of this hope in the heart of the Church.

<p>In the time leading up to the third Millennium after Christ, while "the
Spirit and the bride say to the Lord Jesus: Come!", this prayer of theirs
is filled, as always, with an eschatological significance, which is also
destined to give fulness of meaning to the celebration of the great
Jubilee. It is a prayer concerned with the salvific destinies towards
which the Holy Spirit by his action opens hearts throughout the history
of man on earth. But at the same time this prayer is directed towards a
precise moment of history which highlights the "fullness of time" marked
by the year 2000. The Church wishes to prepare for this Jubilee in the
Holy Spirit, just as the Virgin of Nazareth in whom the Word was made
flesh was prepared by the Holy Spirit.

<p>67. We wish to bring to a close these consideration in the heart of the
Church and in the heart of man. The way of the Church passes through the
heart of man, because here is the hidden place of the salvific encounter
with the

<p>Holy Spirit, with the hidden God, and precisely here the Holy Spirit
becomes "a spring of water welling up to eternal life". [289] He comes
here as the Spirit of truth and as the Paraclete, as he was promised by
Christ. From here he acts as Counsellor, Intercessor, Advocate,
especially when man, when humanity find themselves before the judgment of
condemnation by that "accuser" about whom the Book of Revelation says
that "he accuses them day and night before our God". [290] The Holy Spirit
does not cease to be the guardian of hope in the human heart: the hope of
all human creatures, and especially of those who "have the first fruits
of the Spirit" and "wait for the redemption of their bodies". [291]

<p>The Holy Spirit, in his mysterious bond of divine communion with the
Redeemer of man, is the one who brings about the continuity of his work:
he takes from Christ and transmits to all, unceasingly entering into the
history of the world through the heart of man. Here he becomes as the
liturgical Sequence of the Solemnity of Pentecost proclaims the true "
father of the poor, giver of gifts, light of hearts"; he becomes the
"sweet guest of the soul", whom the Church unceasingly greets on the
threshold of the inmost sanctuary of every human being. For he brings
"rest and relief" in the midst of toil, in the midst of the work of human
hands and minds; he brings "rest" and "ease" in the midst of the heat
of the day, in the midst of the anxieties, struggles and perils of every
age; he brings "consolation", when the human heart grieves and is
tempted to despair.

<p>And therefore the same Sequence exclaims: "Without your aid nothing is in
man, nothing is without fault". For only the Holy Spirit "convinces
concerning sin", concerning evil, in order to restore what is good in man
and in the world: in order to "renew the face of the earth". Therefore,
he purifies from everything that "disfigures" man, from "what is
unclean"; he heals even the deepest wounds of human existence; he changes
the interior dryness of souls, transforming them into fertile fields of
grace and holiness. What is "hard he softens", what is "frozen he warms",
what is "wayward he sets anew" on the paths of salvation. [292]

<p>Praying thus, the Church unceasingly professes her faith that there
exists in our created world a Spirit who is an uncreated gift. He is the
Spirit of the Father and of the Son: like the Father and the Son he is
uncreated, without limit, eternal, omnipotent, God, Lord. [293] This
Spirit of God "fills the universe", and all that is created recognizes
in him the source of its own identity, finds in him its own transcendent
expression, turns to him and awaits him, invokes him with its own being.
Man turns to him, as to the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth and of love,
man who lives by truth and by love, and who without the source of truth
and of love cannot live. To him curs the Church, which is the heart of
humanity, to implore for all and dispense to all those gifts of the love
Which through him "has been poured into our hearts. [294] To him turns
the Church, along the intricate paths of man's pilgrimage on earth: she
implores, she unceasingly implores uprightness of human acts, as the
Spirit's work; she implores the joy and consolation that only he, the
true Counsellor, can bring by coming down into people's inmost hearts;
 [295] the Church implores the grace of the virtues that merit heavenly
glory, implores eternal salvation, in the full communication of the
divine life, to which the Father has eternally a predestined" human
beings, created through love in the image and likeness of the Most Holy
Trinity.

<p>The Church with her heart which embraces all human hearts implores from
the Holy Spirit that happiness which only in God has its complete
realization: the joy "that no one will be able to take away", [296] the
joy which is the fruit of love, and therefore of God who is love; she
implores "the righteousness, the peace and the joy of the Holy Spirit" in
which, in the words of Saint Paul, consists the Kingdom of God. [297]

<p>Peace too is the fruit of love: that interior peace, which weary man
seeks in his inmost being; that peace besought by humanity, the human
family, peoples, nations, continents, anxiously hoping to obtain it in
the prospect of the transition from the second to the third Christian
Millennium. Since the way of peace passes in the last analysis throughh
loveand seeks to create the civilization of love, the Church fixes her
eyes on him who is the love of the Father and the Son, and in spite of
increasing dangers she does not cease to trust, she does not cease to
invoke and to serve the peace of man on earth. Her trust is based on him
who, being the Spirit-love, is also the Spirit of peace and does not
cease to be present in our human world, on the horizon of minds and
hearts, in order to "fill the universe" with love and peace.

<p>Before him I kneel at the end of these considerations, and implore him,
as the Spirit of the Father and the Son, to grant to all of us the
blessing and grace which I desire to pass on, in the name of the Most
Holy Trinity, to the sons and daughters of the Church and to the whole
human family.

<p>Given in Rome, at Saint Peter's, on 18 May, the Solemnnity of Pentecost,
in the year 1986, the eighth of my Pontificate.
