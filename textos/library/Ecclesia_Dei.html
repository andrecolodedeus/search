<h1>Ecclesia Dei</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</b>
<br><b>Apostolic Letter</b>
<br><b>July 2, 1988</b>

<p>With great affliction the Church has learned of the unlawful episcopal
ordination conferred on June 30 by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, which has
frustrated all the efforts made during the previous years to ensure the
full communion with the Church of the Priestly Society of St. Pius X
founded by the same Archbishop Lefebvre. These efforts, especially intense
during recent months, in which the Apostolic See has shown comprehension
to the limits of the possible, were all to no avail.
[Cf. Informatory note of June 16, 1988; <i>L'Osservatore Romano, English ed.</i>, June 27, 1988, pp. 1-2.]

<p>2. This affliction was particularly felt by the successor of Peter, to
whom in the first place pertains the guardianship of the unity of the
Church
[Cf. Vatican Council I, "Pastor Aeternus," Ch. 3; Denzinger-Schonmetzer 3060],
even though the number of persons directly involved in these
events might be few, since every person is loved by God on his own account
and has been redeemed by the blood of Christ shed on the cross for the
salvation of all.

<p>The particular circumstances, both objective and subjective, in which
Archbishop Lefebvre acted provide everyone with an occasion for profound
reflection and for a renewed pledge of fidelity to Christ and to his
Church.

<p>3. In itself this act was one of disobedience to the Roman pontiff in a
very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church,
such as is the ordination of bishops whereby the apostolic succession is
sacramentally perpetuated. Hence such disobedience--which implies in
practice the rejection of the Roman primacy--constitutes a schismatic
act. [Code of Canon Law, 751.] In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal canonical
warning sent to them by the cardinal prefect of the Congregation for
Bishops last June 17, Archbishop Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay,
Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta
have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by
ecclesiastical law.
[Cf. Code of Canon Law, 1382.]

<p>4. The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and
contradictory notion of tradition. Incomplete, because it does not take
sufficiently into account the living character of tradition, which, as the
Second Vatican Council clearly taught, "comes from the apostles and
progresses in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit. There is a
growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on.
This comes about in various ways. It comes through the contemplation and
study of believers, who ponder these things in their hearts. It comes from
the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience. And it
comes from the preaching of those who have received, along with their
right of succession in the episcopate, the sure charism of truth."
[Vatican Council II, "Dei Verbum," 8; cf. Vatican Council I, "Dei Filius," Ch. 4; DS 3020.]

<p>But especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the
universal magisterium of the Church possessed by the bishop of Rome and
the body of bishops. It is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition
while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom, in the person of the
apostle Peter, Christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his
Church. [Cf. Mt. 16:18; Lk, 10:16; "Pastor Aeternus," Ch. 3; DS 3060.]

<p>5. Faced with the situation that has arisen, I deem it my duty to inform
all the Catholic faithful of some aspects which this sad event has
highlighted.

<p><blockquote>
a) The outcome of the movement promoted by Archbishop Lefebvre
can and must be, for all the Catholic faithful, a motive for
sincere reflection concerning their own fidelity to the Church's
tradition, authentically interpreted by the ecclesiastical
magisterium, ordinary and extraordinary, especially in the
ecumenical councils from Nicaea to Vatican II. From this
reflection all should draw a renewed and efficacious conviction
of the necessity of strengthening still more their fidelity by
rejecting erroneous interpretations and arbitrary and
unauthorized applications in matters of doctrine, liturgy and
discipline.

<p>To the bishops especially it pertains, by reason of their
pastoral mission, to exercise the important duty of a
clear-sighted vigilance full of charity and firmness, so that
this fidelity may be everywhere safeguarded.
[Cf. Canon 386; Paul VI, "Quique Iam Anni," Dec. 8, 1970; "Acta Apostolicae Sedis" 63 (1971) pp. 97-106.]

<p>However, it is necessary that all the pastors and other faithful
have a new awareness, not only of the lawfulness but also of the
richness for the Church of a diversity of charisms, traditions
of spirituality and apostolate, which also constitutes the
beauty unity in variety: of that blended "harmony" which the
earthly Church raises up to heaven under the impulse of the Holy
Spirit.

<p>b) Moreover, I should like to remind theologians and other
experts in the ecclesiastical sciences that they should feel
called upon to answer in the present circumstances. Indeed, the
extent and depth of the teaching of the Second Vatican Council
call for a renewed commitment to deeper study in order to reveal
clearly the council's continuity with tradition, especially in
points of doctrine which, perhaps because they are new, have not
yet been well understood by some sections of the Church.

<p>c) In the present circumstances I wish especially to make an
appeal both solemn and heartfelt, paternal and fraternal, to all
those who until now have been linked in various ways to the
movement of Archbishop Lefebvre, that they may fulfill the grave
duty of remaining united to the vicar of Christ in the unity of
the Catholic Church and of ceasing their support in any way for
that movement. Everyone should be aware that formal adherence to
the schism is a grave offense against God and carries the
penalty of excommunication decreed by the Church's law.
[Cf. Code of Canon Law, 1364.]

<p>To all those Catholic faithful who feel attached to some
previous liturgical and disciplinary forms of the latin
tradition, I wish to manifest my will to facilitate their
ecclesial communion by means of the necessary measures to
guarantee respect for their rightful aspirations. In this matter
I ask for the support of the bishops and of all those engaged in
the pastoral ministry in the Church.
</blockquote>

<p>6. Taking account of the importance and complexity of the problems
referred to in this document, by virtue of my apostolic authority I decree
the following:

<p><blockquote>
a) A commission is instituted whose task it will be to
collaborate with the bishops, with the departments of the Roman
Curia and with the circles concerned, for the purpose of
facilitating full ecclesial communion of priests, seminarians,
religious communities or individuals until now linked in various
ways to the society founded by Archbishop Lefebvre who may wish
to remain united to the successor of Peter in the Catholic
Church while preserving their spiritual and liturgical
traditions in the light of the protocol signed on last May 5 by
Cardinal Ratzinger and Archbishop Lefebvre.

<p>b) This commission is composed of a cardinal-president and other
members of the Roman Curia, in a number that will be deemed
opportune according to circumstances.

<p>c) Moreover, respect must everywhere by shown for the feelings
of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition
by a wide and generous application of the directives already
issued some time ago by the Apostolic See for the use of the
Roman Missal according to the typical edition of 1962.
[Cf. Congregation for Divine Worship, "Quattuor Abhinc Annos," Oct. 3, 1984; AAS 76 (1984) pp. 1088-1089.]
</blockquote>

<p>7. As this year specially dedicated to the Blessed Virgin is now drawing
to a close, I wish to exhort all to join in unceasing prayer, which the
vicar of Christ, through the intercession of the mother of the Church,
addresses to the Father in the very words of the Son: "That they all may
be one!"

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, July 2, 1988, the 10th year of the
pontificate.

<p>John Paul II
