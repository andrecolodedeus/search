<h1>Grata Recordatio</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on the Rosary
<br>His Holiness Pope John XXIII
<br>September 26, 1959</b>

<p><i>To the Venerable Brethren, the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Local Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>AMONG THE PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS of Our younger days are the Encyclicals
which Pope Leo XIII used to write to the whole Catholic world as the month
of October drew near, in order to urge the faithful to devout recitation of
Mary's rosary during that month in particular.[1]

<p>2. These Encyclicals had varied contents, but they were all very wise,
vibrant with fresh inspiration, and directly relevant to the practice of
the Christian life. In strong and persuasive terms they exhorted Catholics
to pray to God in a spirit of faith through the intercession of Mary, His
Virgin Mother, by reciting the holy rosary. For the rosary is a very
commendable form of prayer and meditation. In saying it we weave a mystic
garland of Ave Maria's, Pater Noster's, and Gloria Patri's. And as we
recite these vocal prayers, we meditate upon the principal mysteries of our
religion; the Incarnation of Jesus Christ and the Redemption of the human
race are proposed, one event after another, for our consideration.

<p>3. These pleasant memories of Our younger days have not faded or vanished
as the years of Our life have passed. On the contrary, We want to declare
in complete frankness and simplicity that the years have made Mary's rosary
all the dearer to Us. We never fail to recite it each day in its entirety
and We intend to recite it with particular devotion during the coming
month.

<p>4. During Our first year as pope--a year which is almost over--We have
several times had occasion to urge the clergy and laity to public and
private prayer. But today We make this same request with even greater
emphasis and earnestness, for reasons which this Encyclical will set out
very briefly.

<p>5. This coming October will mark the end of the first year since the
saintly departure of Our predecessor, Pius XII, from this mortal life in
which he had distinguished himself by so many glorious achievements.

<p>6. Twenty days after his death, We, though all unworthy, were raised to the
Sovereign Pontificate in accord with God's mysterious designs.

<p>7. One pope bequeathed, as it were, to another pope, as a sacred legacy,
the care of the whole Christian flock; with the same pastoral concern each
of them declared his paternal love for all mankind.

<p>8. These two events--the one full of sorrow, the other full of joy--attest
clearly to the world that while all things human gradually decline and
decay, the Roman Pontificate withstands the rush of centuries, even though
the visible Heads of the Church must, one after another, leave this mortal
exile as they complete the span of days which God in His providence has set
for them.

<p>9. But all Christians should turn their thoughts to the late Pope Pius XII
and to his lowly successor, in whom Blessed Peter continues his eternal
mission as supreme pastor, and they should address this prayer to God: "To
preserve in holy religion the Pope, and all clerics in holy orders, we beg
Thee hear us."[2]

<p>10. And now it is a pleasure also to recall that this same Predecessor of
Ours urged all the faithful to pious recitation of the rosary during
October in the Encyclical Ingruentium malorum.[3] We would like to repeat
one admonition[4] from that Encyclical: "Turn in spirit with ever greater
confidence to the Virgin Mother of God, the constant refuge of Christians
in adversity, since she 'has been made a source of salvation for the human
race.'"[5]

<p>11. On October 11, 1959, We shall have the great pleasure of presenting
mission crucifixes to a large group of Catholic missionaries who are about
to leave their beloved homes and undertake the heavy responsibility of
bringing the light of Christianity to distant people.[6] On the same day,
in the afternoon, We are scheduled to visit the North American College on
the Janiculum and there joyously celebrate with its superiors, faculty, and
seminarians the completion of that college's first century.[7]

<p>12. Although these two celebrations fall only by coincidence on the same
day, they have the same meaning and importance: in all that she does the
Catholic Church is motivated by heaven's inspiration and drawn on by the
principles and precepts of eternal truth; all of her children contribute
with a selfless and dynamic will to mutual respect, the fraternal union of
mankind, and solid peace.

<p>13. These young men present such a wonderful spectacle that We must be
optimistic for the future. They have overcome many obstacles and
inconveniences and given themselves to God that other men might gain
Christ,[8] whether in foreign lands as yet untouched by the light of truth
or in those immense, noisy, and busy cities in which the pace of daily
activity, rapid as a whirlwind, sometimes makes souls wither and become
content with earthly goods. From the lips of their elders, who have labored
long in the same cause, comes the ardent prayer of the Prince of the
Apostles: "Grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness."[9]

<p>14. We trust that the apostolic labors of these young men will be commended
to the Virgin Mary in your devout prayers through the month of October.

<p>15. There is another matter also which compels Us to ask that the Sacred
College of Cardinals, you, Venerable Brethren, all priests and nuns, the
sick and disabled, our innocent children, and all Christians address
earnest and suppliant prayers to Jesus Christ and His most loving Mother.
It is this: that those who, in great measure, hold the future of nations in
their hands consider attentively the dangerous pass to which our age has
come. Be these nations large or small, their legitimate rights and their
inheritance of spiritual riches are sacred and must be safeguarded.

<p>16. Therefore We pray God that their rulers may carefully weigh and
consider the causes of dissension and endeavor in good faith to remove
them. They must, above all, realize that war (God keep it from us!) can
have only one result, vast ruins everywhere, and thus cannot be the object
of anyone's reliance. They must adapt to the needs of men of today the laws
which regulate the state and society and which bind together nations and
classes of society. They must be mindful of the eternal laws which come
from God and are the bases and pivots of all government. Finally, they must
be ever aware that the individual souls of men are created by God and
destined to possess and enjoy Him.

<p>17. It must also be remarked that there are current today certain schools
of thought and philosophy and certain attitudes toward the practical
conduct of life which cannot possibly be reconciled with the teachings of
Christianity. This impossibility We shall never cease from asserting in
firm and unambiguous, though also calm terms.

<p>But God wishes the welfare of men and of nations![10]

<p>18. And so We hope that men will set aside those sterile postulates and
assumptions, hard as rock and just as inflexible, which rise from a way of
thinking and acting that is infected with laicism and materialism, and that
they will find a complete cure in that sound doctrine which experience
makes more certain with every day that passes. We mean that doctrine which
attests that God is the author of life and its laws, that He is guarantor
of the rights and dignity of the human person. God then is "our refuge and
our Redemption."[11]

<p>19. Our thoughts turn to all the lands of this earth. We see all mankind
striving for a better future; We see the awakening of a mysterious force,
and this permits Us to hope that men will be drawn by a right conscience
and a sense of duty to advance the real interests of human society. That
this goal may be realized in the fullest sense--that is, with the triumph
of the kingdom of truth, justice, peace, and charity--We exhort all Our
children in Christ to be "of one heart and one soul"[12] and to pour out
ardent prayers in October to our Queen in heaven and our loving Mother,
reflecting upon the words of the Apostle: "In all things we suffer
tribulation, but we are not distressed; we are sore pressed, but we are not
destitute; we endure persecution, but we are not forsaken; we are cast
down, but we do not perish; always bearing about in our body the dying of
Jesus, so that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodily
frame."[13]

<p>20. Before We conclude this Encyclical We also wish to ask you, Venerable
Brethren, to recite Mary's rosary through the month of October with
particular devotion, and to entreat the Virgin Mother of God in suppliant
prayer, for another intention which is dear to Our heart: that the Roman
Synod may bring many blessings and benefits upon this city; that the
forthcoming Ecumenical Council, in which you will participate by your
presence and your advice, will add wondrous growth to the universal Church;
and that the renewed vigor of all the Christian virtues which We hope this
Council will produce will also serve as an invitation and incentive to
reunion for Our Brethren and children who are separated from this Apostolic
See.

<p>21. In this fond hope, We lovingly impart the Apostolic Blessing to each
and every one of you, Venerable Brethren, to the flocks entrusted to your
care, and to those individuals especially who will respond to Our
entreaties in a devout and zealous spirit.

<p>22. Given at Rome, in St. Peter's, on the 26th day of September, in the
year 1959, the first of Our Pontificate.
