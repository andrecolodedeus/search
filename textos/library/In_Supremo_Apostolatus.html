<h1>In Supremo Apostolatus</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Letter of Pope Gregory XVI on the Slave Trade. Promulgated on December 3, 1839</b>

<p>PLACED AT THE SUMMIT of the Apostolic power and, although lacking in
merits, holding the place of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Who, being made
Man through utmost Charity, deigned to die for the Redemption of the
World, We have judged that it belonged to Our pastoral solicitude to exert
Ourselves to turn away the Faithful from the inhuman slave trade in
Negroes and all other men. Assuredly, since there was spread abroad,
first of all amongst the Christians, the light of the Gospel, these
miserable people, who in such great numbers, and chiefly through the
effects of wars, fell into very cruel slavery, experienced an alleviation
of their lot. Inspired in fact by the Divine Spirit, the Apostles, it is
true, exhorted the slaves themselves to obey their masters, according to
the flesh, as though obeying Christ, and sincerely to accomplish the Will
of God; but they ordered the masters to act well towards slaves, to give
them what was just and equitable, and to abstain from menaces, knowing
that the common Master both of themselves and of the slaves is in Heaven,
and that with Him there is no distinction of persons.

<p>But as the law of the Gospel universally and earnestly enjoined a sincere
charity towards all, and considering that Our Lord Jesus Christ had
declared that He considered as done or refused to Himself everything kind
and merciful done or refused to the small and needy, it naturally follows,
not only that Christians should regard as their brothers their slaves and,
above all, their Christian slaves, but that they should be more inclined
to set free those who merited it; which it was the custom to do chiefly
upon the occasion of the Easter Feast as Gregory of Nyssa tells us. There
were not lacking Christians, who, moved by an ardent charity 'cast
themselves into bondage in order to redeem others,' many instances of
which our predecessor, Clement I, of very holy memory, declares to have
come to his knowledge. In the process of time, the fog of pagan
superstition being more completely dissipated and the manners of barbarous
people having been softened, thanks to Faith operating by Charity, it at
last comes about that, since several centuries, there are no more slaves
in the greater number of Christian nations. But -- We say with profound
sorrow -- there were to be found afterwards among the Faithful men who,
shamefully blinded by the desire of sordid gain, in lonely and distant
countries, did not hesitate to reduce to slavery Indians, negroes and
other wretched peoples, or else, by instituting or developing the trade in
those who had been made slaves by others, to favour their unworthy
practice. Certainly many Roman Pontiffs of glorious memory, Our
Predecessors, did not fail, according to the duties of their charge, to
blame severely this way of acting as dangerous for the spiritual welfare
of those engaged in the traffic and a shame to the Christian name; they
foresaw that as a result of this, the infidel peoples would be more and
more strengthened in their hatred of the true Religion.

<p>It is at these practices that are aimed the
<a href="../docs/pa03sd.htm">Letter Apostolic of Paul III</a>,
given on May 29, 1537, under the seal of the Fisherman, and addressed to
the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, and afterwards another Letter, more
detailed, addressed by Urban VIII on April 22, 1639 to the Collector
Jurium of the Apostolic Chamber of Portugal. In the latter are severely
and particularly condemned those who should dare 'to reduce to slavery the
Indians of the Eastern and Southern Indies,' to sell them, buy them,
exchange them or give them, separate them from their wives and children,
despoil them of their goods and properties, conduct or transport them into
other regions, or deprive them of liberty in any way whatsoever, retain
them in servitude, or lend counsel, succour, favour and co-operation to
those so acting, under no matter what pretext or excuse, or who proclaim
and teach that this way of acting is allowable and co-operate in any
manner whatever in the practices indicated.

<p>Benedict XIV confirmed and renewed the penalties of the Popes above
mentioned in a new Apostolic Letter addressed on December 20, 1741, to the
Bishops of Brazil and some other regions, in which he stimulated, to the
same end, the solicitude of the Governors themselves. Another of Our
Predecessors, anterior to Benedict XIV, Pius II, as during his life the
power of the Portuguese was extending itself over New Guinea, sent on
October 7, 1462, to a Bishop who was leaving for that country, a Letter in
which he not only gives the Bishop himself the means of exercising there
the sacred ministry with more fruit, but on the same occasion, addresses
grave warnings with regard to Christians who should reduce neophytes to slavery.

<p>In our time Pius VII, moved by the same religious and charitable spirit as
his Predecessors, intervened zealously with those in possession of power
to secure that the slave trade should at least cease amongst the
Christians. The penalties imposed and the care given by Our Predecessors
contributed in no small measure, with the help of God, to protect the
Indians and the other people mentioned against the cruelty of the invaders
or the cupidity of Christian merchants, without however carrying success
to such a point that the Holy See could rejoice over the complete success
of its efforts in this direction; for the slave trade, although it has
diminished in more than one district, is still practiced by numerous
Christians. This is why, desiring to remove such a shame from all the
Christian nations, having fully reflected over the whole question and
having taken the advice of many of Our Venerable Brothers the Cardinals of
the Holy Roman Church, and walking in the footsteps of Our Predecessors,
We warn and adjure earnestly in the Lord faithful Christians of every
condition that no one in the future dare to vex anyone, despoil him of his
possessions, reduce to servitude, or lend aid and favour to those who give
themselves up to these practices, or exercise that inhuman traffic by
which the Blacks, as if they were not men but rather animals, having been
brought into servitude, in no matter what way, are, without any
distinction, in contempt of the rights of justice and humanity, bought,
sold, and devoted sometimes to the hardest labour. Further, in the hope
of gain, propositions of purchase being made to the first owners of the
Blacks, dissensions and almost perpetual conflicts are aroused in these regions.

<p>We reprove, then, by virtue of Our Apostolic Authority, all the practices
abovementioned as absolutely unworthy of the Christian name. By the same
Authority We prohibit and strictly forbid any Ecclesiastic or lay person
from presuming to defend as permissible this traffic in Blacks under no
matter what pretext or excuse, or from publishing or teaching in any
manner whatsoever, in public or privately, opinions contrary to what We
have set forth in this Apostolic Letter.

<p><i>Note: This Apostolic Letter was read during the 4th Provincial Council of Baltimore, December 3, 1839.</i>)
