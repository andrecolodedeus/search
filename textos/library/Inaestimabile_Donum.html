<h1>Inaestimabile Donum</h1>  
<p><b>Instruction Concerning Worship of the Eucharistic Mystery
<br>Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship
<br>Approved and Confirmed by His Holiness Pope John Paul II on April 17, 1980</b>

<p><b>Foreword</b>

<p>Following the letter that Pope John Paul II addressed on February 24,
1980, to the bishops and, through them, to the priests, and in which he
again considered the priceless gift of the Holy Eucharist, the Sacred
Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship is calling to the
bishops' attention certain norms concerning worship of this great mystery.

<p>These indications are not a summary of everything already stated by the
Holy See in the documents concerning the Eucharist promulgated since the
Second Vatican Council and still in force, particularly in the Missale
Romanum,[1] the Ritual De Sacra Communione et de Cultu Mysterii
Eucharistici Extra Missam,[2] and the Instructions Eucharisticum
Mysterium,[3] Memoriale Domini,[4] Immensae caritatis,[5] and Liturgicae
instaurationes.[6]

<p>This Sacred Congregation notes with great joy the many positive results
of the liturgical reform: a more active and conscious participation by
the faithful in the liturgical mysteries, doctrinal and catechetical
enrichment through the use of the vernacular, and the wealth of readings
from the Bible, a growth in the community sense of liturgical life, and
successful efforts to close the gap between life and worship, between
Liturgical piety and personal piety, and between Liturgy and popular
piety.

<p>But these encouraging and positive aspects cannot suppress concern at the
varied and frequent abuses being reported from different parts of the
Catholic world: the confusion of roles, especially regarding the priestly
ministry and the role of the laity (indiscriminate shared recitation of
the Eucharistic Prayer, homilies given by lay people, lay people
distributing Communion while the priests refrain from doing so); an
increasing loss of the sense of the sacred (abandonment of liturgical
vestments, the Eucharist celebrated outside church without real need,
lack of reverence and respect for the Blessed Sacrament, etc.);
misunderstanding of the ecclesial character of the Liturgy (the use of
private texts, the proliferation of unapproved Eucharistic Prayers, the
manipulation of the liturgical texts for social and political ends) . In
these cases we are face to face with a real falsification of the Catholic
Liturgy: "One who offers worship to God on the Church's behalf in a way
contrary to that which is laid down by the Church with God-given
authority and which is customary in the Church is guilty of
falsification."[7]

<p>None of these things can bring good results. The consequences are--and
cannot fail to be--the impairing of the unity of Faith and worship in the
Church, doctrinal uncertainty, scandal and bewilderment among the People
of God, and the near inevitability of violent reactions.

<p>The faithful have a right to a true Liturgy, which means the Liturgy
desired and laid down by the Church, which has in fact indicated where
adaptations may be made as called for by pastoral requirements in
different places or by different groups of people. Undue experimentation,
changes and creativity bewilder the faithful. The use of unauthorized
texts means a loss of the necessary connection between the lex orandi and
the lex credendi. The Second Vatican Council's admonition in this regard
must be remembered: "No person, even if he be a priest, may add, remove
or change anything in the Liturgy on his own authority."[8] And Paul VI
of venerable memory stated that: "Anyone who takes advantage of the
reform to indulge in arbitrary experiments is wasting energy and
offending the ecclesial sense."[9]

<p><b>A. The Mass</b>

<p>1. "The two parts which in a sense go to make up the Mass, namely the
Liturgy of the Word and the Eucharistic Liturgy, are so closely connected
that they form but one single act of worship."[10] A person should not
approach the table of the Bread of the Lord without having first been at
the table of His Word.[11] Sacred Scripture is therefore of the highest
importance in the celebration of Mass. Consequently there can be no
disregarding what the Church has laid down in order to insure that "in
sacred celebrations there should be a more ample, more varied and more
suitable reading from Sacred Scripture."[12] The norms laid down in the
Lectionary concerning the number of readings, and the directives given
for special occasions are to be observed. It would be a serious abuse to
replace the Word of God with the word of man, no matter who the author
may be.[13]

<p>2. The reading of the Gospel passage is reserved to the ordained
minister, namely the deacon or the priest. When possible, the other
readings should be entrusted to a reader who has been instituted as such,
or to other spiritually and technically trained lay people. The first
reading is followed by a responsorial psalm, which is an integral part of
the Liturgy of the Word.[14]

<p>3. The purpose of the homily is to explain to the faithful the Word of
God proclaimed in the readings, and to apply its message to the present.
Accordingly the homily is to be given by the priest or the deacon.[15]

<p>4. It is reserved to the priest, by virtue of his ordination, to proclaim
the Eucharistic Prayer, which of its nature is the high point of the
whole celebration. It is therefore an abuse to have some parts of the
Eucharistic Prayer said by the deacon, by a lower minister, or by the
faithful.[16] On the other hand the assembly does not remain passive and
inert; it unites itself to the priest in faith and silence and shows its
concurrence by the various interventions provided for in the course of
the Eucharistic Prayer: the responses to the Preface dialogue, the
Sanctus, the acclamation after the Consecration, and the final Amen after
the Per Ipsum. The Per Ipsum itself is reserved to the priest. This Amen
especially should be emphasized by being sung, since it is the most
important in the whole Mass.

<p>5. Only the Eucharistic Prayers included in the Roman Missal or those
that the Apostolic See has by law admitted, in the manner and within the
limits laid down by the Holy See, are to be used. To modify the
Eucharistic Prayers approved by the Church or to adopt others privately
composed is a most serious abuse.

<p>6. It should be remembered that the Eucharistic Prayer must not be
overlaid with other prayers or songs.[17] When proclaiming the
Eucharistic Prayer, the priest is to pronounce the text clearly, so as to
make it easy for the faithful to understand it, and so as to foster the
formation of a true assembly entirely intent upon the celebration of the
memorial of the Lord.

<p>7. Concelebration, which has been restored in the Western Liturgy,
manifests in an exceptional manner the unity of the priesthood.
Concelebrants must, therefore, pay careful attention to the signs that
indicate that unity. For example, they are to be present from the
beginning of the celebration, they are to wear the prescribed vestments,
they are to occupy the place appropriate to their ministry as
concelebrants, and they are to observe faithfully the other norms for the
seemly performance of the rite.[18]

<p>8. Matter of the Eucharist. Faithful to Christ's example, the Church has
constantly used bread and wine mixed with water to celebrate the Lord's
Supper. The bread for the celebration of the Eucharist, in accordance
with the tradition of the whole Church, must be made solely of wheat,
and, in accordance with the tradition proper to the Latin Church, it must
be unleavened. By reason of the sign, the matter of the Eucharistic
celebration "should appear as actual food." This is to be understood as
linked to the consistency of the bread, and not to its form, which
remains the traditional one. No other ingredients are to be added to the
wheaten flour and water. The preparation of the bread requires attentive
care to ensure that the product does not detract from the dignity due to
the Eucharistic bread, can be broken in a dignified way, does not give
rise to excessive fragments, and does not offend the sensibilities of the
faithful when they eat it. The wine for the Eucharistic celebration must
be of "the fruit of the vine" (Lk. 22:18) and be natural and genuine,
that is to say not mixed with other substances.[19]

<p>9. Eucharistic Communion. Communion is a gift of the Lord, given to the
faithful through the minister appointed for this purpose. It is not
permitted that the faithful should themselves pick up the consecrated
bread and the sacred chalice, still less that they should hand them from
one to another.

<p>10. The faithful, whether religious or lay, who are authorized as
extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist can distribute Communion only
when there is no priest, deacon or acolyte, when the priest is impeded by
illness or advanced age, or when the number of the faithful going to
Communion is so large as to make the celebration of Mass excessively
long.[20] Accordingly, a reprehensible attitude is shown by those priests
who, though present at the celebration, refrain from distributing
Communion and leave this task to the laity.

<p>11. The Church has always required from the faithful respect and
reverence for the Eucharist at the moment of receiving it.

<p>With regard to the manner of going to Communion, the faithful can receive
it either kneeling or standing, in accordance with the norms laid down by
the episcopal conference: "When the faithful communicate kneeling, no
other sign of reverence towards the Blessed Sacrament is required, since
kneeling is itself a sign of adoration. When they receive Communion
standing, it is strongly recommended that, coming up in procession, they
should make a sign of reverence before receiving the Sacrament. This
should be done at the right time and place, so that the order of people
going to and from Communion is not disrupted."[2]

<p>The Amen said by the faithful when receiving Communion is an act of
personal faith in the presence of Christ.

<p>12. With regard to Communion under both kinds, the norms laid down by the
Church must be observed, both by reason of the reverence due to the
Sacrament and for the good of those receiving the Eucharist, in
accordance with variations in circumstances, times and places.[22]

<p>Episcopal conferences and ordinaries also are not to go beyond what is
laid down in the present discipline: the granting of permission for
Communion under both kinds is not to be indiscriminate, and the
celebrations in question are to be specified precisely; the groups that
use this faculty are to be clearly defined, well disciplined, and
homogeneous.[23]

<p>13. Even after Communion the Lord remains present under the species.
Accordingly, when Communion has been distributed, the sacred particles
remaining are to be consumed or taken by the competent minister to the
place where the Eucharist is reserved.

<p>14. On the other hand, the consecrated wine is to be consumed immediately
after Communion and may not be kept. Care must be taken to consecrate
only the amount of wine needed for Communion.

<p>15. The rules laid down for the purification of the chalice and the other
sacred vessels that have contained the Eucharistic species must be
observed.[24]

<p>16. Particular respect and care are due to the sacred vessels, both the
chalice and paten for the celebration of the Eucharist, and the ciboria
for the Communion of the faithful. The form of the vessels must be
appropriate for the liturgical use for which they are meant. The material
must be noble, durable, and in every case adapted to sacred use. In this
sphere, judgment belongs to the episcopal conference of the individual
regions.

<p>Use is not to be made of simple baskets or other recipients meant for
ordinary use outside the sacred celebrations, nor are the sacred vessels
to be of poor quality or lacking any artistic style.

<p>Before being used, chalices and patens must be blessed by the bishop or
by a priest.[25]

<p>17. The faithful are to be recommended not to omit to make a proper
thanksgiving after Communion. They may do this during the celebration
with a period of silence, with a hymn, psalm or other song of praise,[26]
 or also after the celebration, if possible by staying behind to pray for
a suitable time.

<p>18. There are, of course, various roles that women can perform in the
liturgical assembly: these include reading the Word of God and
proclaiming the intentions of the Prayer of the Faithful. Women are not,
however, permitted to act as altar servers.[27]

<p>19. Particular vigilance and special care are recommended with regard to
Masses transmitted by the audiovisual media. Given their very wide
diffusion, their celebration must be of exemplary quality.[28]

<p>In the case of celebrations that are held in private houses, the norms of
the Instruction Actio pastoralis of May 15, 1969, are to be observed.[29]

<p><b>B. Eucharistic Worship Outside Mass</b>

<p>20. Public and private devotion to the Holy Eucharist outside Mass also
is highly recommended: for the presence of Christ, who is adored by the
faithful in the Sacrament, derives from the sacrifice and is directed
towards sacramental and spiritual Communion.

<p>21. When Eucharistic devotions are arranged, account should be taken of
the liturgical season, so that they harmonize with the Liturgy, draw
inspiration from it in some way, and lead the Christian people toward
it.[30]

<p>22. With regard to exposition of the Holy Eucharist, either prolonged or
brief, and with regard to processions of the Blessed Sacrament,
Eucharistic Congresses, and the whole ordering of Eucharistic piety, the
pastoral indications and directives given in the Roman Ritual are to be
observed.[31]

<p>23. It must not be forgotten that "before the blessing with the
Sacrament, an appropriate time should be devoted to the reading of the
Word of God, to songs and prayers, and to some silent prayer."[32] At the
end of the adoration, a hymn is sung, and a prayer chosen from among the
many contained in the Roman Ritual is recited or sung.[33]

<p>24. The tabernacle in which the Eucharist is kept can be located on an
altar, or away from it, in a spot in the church which is very prominent,
truly noble, and duly decorated, or in a chapel suitable for private
prayer and for adoration by the faithful.[34]

<p>25. The tabernacle should be solid, unbreakable, and not transparent.[35]
 The presence of the Eucharist is to be indicated by a tabernacle veil or
by some other suitable means laid down by the competent authority, and a
lamp must perpetually burn before it, as a sign of honor paid to the
Lord.[36]

<p>26. The venerable practice of genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament,
whether enclosed in the tabernacle or publicly exposed, as a sign of
adoration, is to be maintained.[37] This act requires that it be
performed in a recollected way. In order that the heart may bow before
God in profound reverence, the genuflection must be neither hurried nor
careless.

<p>27. If anything has been introduced that is at variance with these
indications, it is to be corrected.

<p>Most of the difficulties encountered in putting into practice the reform
of the Liturgy and especially the reform of the Mass stem from the fact
that neither priests nor faithful have perhaps been sufficiently aware of
the theological and spiritual reasons for which the changes have been
made, in accordance with the principles laid down by the Council.

<p>Priests must acquire an ever deeper understanding of the authentic way of
looking at the Church,[38] of which the celebration of the Liturgy and
especially of the Mass is the living expression. Without an adequate
biblical training, priests will not be able to present to the faithful
the meaning of the Liturgy as an enactment, in signs, of the history of
salvation. Knowledge of the history of the Liturgy will likewise
contribute to an understanding of the changes which have been introduced,
and introduced not for the sake of novelty but as a revival and
adaptation of authentic and genuine tradition.

<p>The Liturgy also requires great balance, for, as the Constitution
Sacrosanctum Concilium says, it "is thus the outstanding means by which
the faithful can express in their lives, and manifest to others, the
mystery of Christ and the real nature of the true Church. It is of the
essence of the Church that she be both human and divine, visible and yet
invisibly endowed, eager to act and yet devoted to contemplation, present
in this world and yet not at home in it. She is all these things in such
a way that in her the human is directed and subordinated to the divine,
the visible likewise to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this
present world to that city yet to come, which we seek."[39] Without this
balance, the true face of Christian Liturgy becomes obscured.

<p>In order to reach these ideals more easily it will be necessary to foster
liturgical formation in seminaries and faculties[40] and to facilitate
the participation of priests in courses, meetings, assemblies or
liturgical weeks, in which study and reflection should be properly
complemented by model celebrations. In this way priests will be able to
devote themselves to more effective pastoral action, to liturgical
catechesis of the faithful, to organizing groups of lectors, to giving
altar servers spiritual and practical training, to training animators of
the assembly, to enriching progressively the repertoire of songs, in a
word to all the initiatives favoring an ever deeper understanding of the
Liturgy.

<p>In the implementation of the liturgical reform, great responsibility
falls upon national and diocesan liturgical commissions and liturgical
institutes and centers, especially in the work of translating the
liturgical books and training the clergy and faithful in the spirit of
the reform desired by the Council.

<p>The work of these bodies must be at the service of the ecclesiastical
authority, which should be able to count upon their faithful
collaboration. Such collaboration must be faithful to the Church's norms
and directives, and free of arbitrary initiatives and particular ways of
acting that could compromise the fruits of the liturgical renewal.

<p>This document will come into the hands of God's ministers in the first
decade of the life of the Missale Romanum promulgated by Pope Paul VI
following the prescriptions of the Second Vatican Council.

<p>It seems fitting to recall a remark made by that Pope concerning fidelity
to the norms governing celebration: "It is a very serious thing when
division is introduced precisely where congregavit nos in unum Christi
amor, in the Liturgy and the Eucharistic Sacrifice, by the refusing of
obedience to the norms laid down in the liturgical sphere. It is in the
name of tradition that we ask all our sons and daughters, all the
Catholic communities, to celebrate with dignity and fervor the renewed
Liturgy."[41]

<p>The bishops, "whose function it is to control, foster, and safeguard the
entire liturgical life of the Church entrusted to them,"[42] will not
fail to discover the most suitable means for ensuring a careful and firm
application of these norms, for the glory of God and the good of the
Church.

<p>Rome, April 3, 1980, Holy Thursday.

<p>This instruction, prepared by the Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments
and Divine Worship, was approved on April 17,1980, by the Holy Father,
John Paul II, who confirmed it with his own authority and ordered it to
be published and to be observed by all concerned.
