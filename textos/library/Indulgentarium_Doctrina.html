<h1>Indulgentarium Doctrina</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Constitution on Indulgences
<br>His Holiness Pope Paul VI
<br>Promulgated on January 1, 1967</b>

<p>THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF INDULGENCES which have been in force for
many centuries in the Catholic Church have a solid foundation in divine
revelation[1] which comes from the Apostles and "develops in the Church
with the help of the Holy Spirit," while "as the centuries succeed one
another the Church constantly moves forward toward the fullness of divine
truth until the words of God reach their complete fulfillment in her."[2]

<p>For an exact understanding of this doctrine and of its beneficial use it
is necessary, however, to remember truths which the entire Church
illumined by the Word of God has always believed and which the bishops,
the successors of the Apostles, and first and foremost among them the
Roman Pontiffs, the successors of Peter, have taught by means of pastoral
practice as well as doctrinal documents throughout the course of
centuries to this day.

<p>2. It is a divinely revealed truth that sins bring punishments inflicted
by God's sanctity and justice. These must be expiated either on this
earth through the sorrows, miseries and calamities of this life and above
all through death,[3] or else in the life beyond through fire and
torments or "purifying" punishments.[4] Therefore it has always been the
conviction of the faithful that the paths of evil are fraught with many
stumbling blocks and bring adversities, bitterness and harm to those who
follow them.[5]

<p>These punishments are imposed by the just and merciful judgment of God
for the purification of souls, the defense of the sanctity of the moral
order and the restoration of the glory of God to its full majesty. Every
sin in fact causes a perturbation in the universal order established by
God in His ineffable wisdom and infinite charity, and the destruction of
immense values with respect to the sinner himself and to the human
community. Christians throughout history have always regarded sin not
only as a transgression of divine law but also--though not always in a
direct and evident way--as contempt for or disregard of the friendship
between God and man,[6] just as they have regarded it as a real and
unfathomable offense against God and indeed an ungrateful rejection of
the love of God shown us through Jesus Christ, who called His disciples
friends and not servants.[7]

<p>3. It is therefore necessary for the full remission and--as it is
called--reparation of sins not only that friendship with God be
reestablished by a sincere conversion of the mind and amends made for the
offense against His wisdom and goodness, but also that all the personal
as well as social values and those of the universal order itself, which
have been diminished or destroyed by sin, be fully reintegrated whether
through voluntary reparation which will involve punishment or through
acceptance of the punishments established by the just and most holy
wisdom of God, from which there will shine forth throughout the world the
sanctity and the splendor of His glory. The very existence and the
gravity of the punishment enable us to understand the foolishness and
malice of sin and its harmful consequences.

<p>That punishment or the vestiges of sin may remain to be expiated or
cleansed and that they in fact frequently do even after the remission of
guilt[8] is clearly demonstrated by the doctrine on purgatory. In
purgatory, in fact, the souls of those "who died in the charity of God
and truly repentant, but before satisfying with worthy fruits of penance
for sins committed and for omissions"[9] are cleansed after death with
purgatorial punishments. This is also clearly evidenced in the liturgical
prayers with which the Christian community admitted to Holy Communion has
addressed God since most ancient times: "that we, who are justly
subjected to afflictions because of our sins, may be mercifully set free
from them for the glory of thy name."[10]

<p>For all men who walk this earth daily commit at least venial sins;[11]
 thus all need the mercy of God to be set free from the penal
consequences of sin.

<p><b>Chapter II</b>

<p>4. There reigns among men, by the hidden and benign mystery of the divine
will, a supernatural solidarity whereby the sin of one harms the others
just as the holiness of one also benefits the others.[12] Thus the
Christian faithful give each other mutual aid to attain their
supernatural aim. A testimony of this solidarity is manifested in Adam
himself, whose sin is passed on through propagation to all men. But of
this supernatural solidarity the greatest and most perfect principle,
foundation and example is Christ Himself to communion with Whom God has
called us.[13]

<p>5. Indeed Christ "committed no sin," "suffered for us,"[14] "was wounded
for our iniquities, bruised for our sins . . . by His bruises we are
healed."[15]

<p>Following in the footsteps of Christ,[16] the Christian faithful have
always endeavored to help one another on the path leading to the heavenly
Father through prayer, the exchange of spiritual goods and penitential
expiation. The more they have been immersed in the fervor of charity, the
more they have imitated Christ in His sufferings, carrying their crosses
in expiation for their own sins and those of others, certain that they
could help their brothers to obtain salvation from God the Father of
mercies.[17] This is the very ancient dogma of the Communion of the
Saints,[18] whereby the life of each individual son of God in Christ and
through Christ is joined by a wonderful link to the life of all his other
Christian brothers in the supernatural unity of the Mystical Body of
Christ till, as it were, a single mystical person is formed.[19]

<p>Thus is explained the "treasury of the Church"[20] which should certainly
not be imagined as the sum total of material goods accumulated in the
course of the centuries, but the infinite and inexhaustible value the
expiation and the merits of Christ Our Lord have before God, offered as
they were so that all of mankind could be set free from sin and attain
communion with the Father. It is Christ the Redeemer Himself in whom the
satisfactions and merits of His redemption exist and find their
force.[21] This treasury also includes the truly immense, unfathomable
and ever pristine value before God of the prayers and good works of the
Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints, who following in the footsteps of
Christ the Lord and by His grace have sanctified their lives and
fulfilled the mission entrusted to them by the Father. Thus while
attaining their own salvation, they have also cooperated in the salvation
of their brothers in the unity of the Mystical Body.

<p>"For all who are in Christ, having His spirit, form one Church and cleave
together in Him" (Eph. 4:16). Therefore the union of the wayfarers with
the brethren who have gone to sleep in the peace of Christ is not in the
least weakened or interrupted, but on the contrary, according to the
perpetual faith of the Church, is strengthened by a communication of
spiritual goods. For by reason of the fact that those in heaven are more
closely united with Christ, they establish the whole Church more firmly
in holiness, lend nobility to the worship which the Church offers to God
here on earth and in many ways contribute to building it up evermore (I
Cor. 12: 12-27). For after they have been received into their heavenly
home and are present to the Lord (11 Cor. 5:8), through Him and with Him
and in Him they do not cease to intervene with the Father for us, showing
forth the merits which they have won on earth through the one Mediator
between God and man, Jesus Christ (I Tim. 2:5), by serving God in all
things and filling up in their flesh those things which are lacking of
the sufferings of Christ for His Body which is the Church (Col. 1:24).
Thus by their brotherly interest our weakness is greatly
strengthened.[22]

<p>For this reason there certainly exists between the faithful who have
already reached their heavenly home, those who are expiating their sins
in purgatory and those who are still pilgrims on earth a perennial link
of charity and an abundant exchange of all the goods by which, with the
expiation of all the sins of the entire Mystical Body, divine justice is
placated. God's mercy is thus led to forgiveness, so that sincerely
repentant sinners may participate as soon as possible in the full
enjoyment of the benefits of the family of God.

<p><b>Chapter III</b>

<p>6. The Church, aware of these truths ever since its origins, formulated
and undertook various ways of applying the fruits of the Lord's
redemption to the individual faithful and of leading them to cooperate in
the salvation of their brothers, so that the entire body of the Church
might be prepared in justice and sanctity for the complete realization of
the kingdom of God, when He will be all things to all men.

<p>The Apostles themselves, in fact, exhorted their disciples to pray for
the salvation of sinners.[23] This very ancient usage of the Church has
blessedly persevered,[24] particularly in the practice of penitents
invoking the intercession of the entire community,[25] and when the dead
are assisted with suffrages, particularly through the offering of the
Eucharistic Sacrifice.[26] Good works, particularly those which human
frailty finds difficult, were also offered to God for the salvation of
sinners from the Church's most ancient times.[27] And since the
sufferings of the martyrs for the faith and for the law of God were
considered of great value, penitents used to turn to the martyrs, to be
helped by their merits to obtain from the bishops a more speedy
reconciliation.[28] Indeed the prayer and good works of the upright were
considered to be of so great value that it could be asserted the penitent
was washed, cleansed and redeemed with the help of the entire Christian
people.[29]

<p>It was not believed, however, that the individual faithful by their own
merits alone worked for the remission of sins of their brothers, but that
the entire Church as a single body united to Christ its Head was bringing
about satisfaction.[30]

<p>The Church of the Fathers was fully convinced that it was pursuing the
work of salvation in community, and under the authority of the pastors
established by the Holy Spirit as bishops to govern the Church of
God.[31] The bishops, therefore, prudently assessing these matters,
established the manner and the measure of the satisfaction to be made and
indeed permitted canonical penances to be replaced by other possibly
easier works, which would be useful to the common good and suitable for
fostering piety, to be performed by the penitents themselves and
sometimes by others among the faithful.[32]

<p><b>Chapter IV</b>

<p>7. The conviction existing in the Church that the pastors of the flock of
the Lord could set the individual free from the vestiges of sins by
applying the merits of Christ and of the saints led gradually, in the
course of the centuries and under the influence of the Holy Spirit's
continuous inspiration of the people of God, to the usage of indulgences
which represented a progression in the doctrine and discipline of the
Church rather than a change.[33] From the roots of revelation a new
advantage grew in benefit to the faithful and the entire Church.

<p>The use of indulgences, which spread gradually, became a very evident
fact in the history of the Church when the Roman Pontiffs decreed that
certain works useful to the common good of the Church "could replace all
penitential practices"[34] and that the faithful who were "truly
repentant and had confessed their sins" and performed such works were
granted "by the mercy of Almighty God and . . . trusting in the merits
and the authority of His Apostles" and 'by virtue of the fullness of the
apostolic power', not only full and abundant forgiveness, but the most
complete forgiveness for their sins possible."[35]

<p>For "the only-begotten son of God . . . has won a treasure for the
militant Church . . . and has entrusted it to blessed Peter, the
keybearer of heaven, and to his successors, Christ's vicars on earth,
that they may distribute it to the faithful for their salvation, applying
it mercifully for reasonable causes to all who are repentant and have
confessed their sins, at times remitting completely and at times
partially the temporal punishment due sin in a general as well as in
special ways insofar as they judge it to be fitting in the eyes of the
Lord. It is known that the merits of the Blessed Mother of God and of all
the elect . . . add further to this treasure."[36]

<p>8. The remission of the temporal punishment due for sins already forgiven
insofar as their guilt is concerned has been called specifically
"indulgence."[37]

<p>It has something in common with other ways or means of eliminating the
vestiges of sin but at the same time it is clearly distinct from them.

<p>In an indulgence in fact, the Church, making use of its power as minister
of the Redemption of Christ, not only prays but by an authoritative
intervention dispenses to the faithful suitably disposed the treasury of
satisfaction which Christ and the saints won for the remission of
temporal punishment.[38]

<p>The aim pursued by ecclesiastical authority in granting indulgences is
not only that of helping the faithful to expiate the punishment due sin
but also that of urging them to perform works of piety, penitence and
charity--particularly those which lead to growth in faith and which favor
the common good.[39]

<p>And if the faithful offer indulgences in suffrage for the dead, they
cultivate charity in an excellent way and while raising their minds to
heaven, they bring a wiser order into the things of this world.

<p>The Magisterium of the Church has defended and illustrated this doctrine
in various documents.[40] Unfortunately, the practice of indulgences has
at times been improperly used either through "untimely and superfluous
indulgences" by which the power of the keys was humiliated and
penitential satisfaction weakened,[41] or through the collection of
"illicit profits" by which indulgences were blasphemously defamed[42] But
the Church, in deploring and correcting these improper uses "teaches and
establishes that the use of indulgences must be preserved because it is
supremely salutary for the Christian people and authoritatively approved
by the sacred councils; and it condemns with anathema those who maintain
the uselessness of indulgences or deny the power of the Church to grant
them."[43]

<p>9. The Church also in our days then invites all its sons to ponder and
meditate well on how the use of indulgences benefits their lives and
indeed all Christian society.

<p>To recall briefly the most important considerations, this salutary
practice teaches us in the first place how it is "sad and bitter to have
abandoned . . . the Lord God."[44] Indeed the faithful when they acquire
indulgences understand that by their own powers they could not remedy the
harm they have done to themselves and to the entire community by their
sin, and they are therefore stirred to a salutary humility.

<p>Furthermore, the use of indulgences shows us how closely we are united to
each other in Christ, and how the supernatural life of each can benefit
others so that these also may be more easily and more closely united with
the Father. Therefore the use of indulgences effectively influences
charity in us and demonstrates that charity in an outstanding manner when
we offer indulgences as assistance to our brothers who rest in Christ.

<p>10. Likewise, the religious practice of indulgences reawakens trust and
hope in a full reconciliation with God the Father, but in such a way as
will not justify any negligence nor in any way diminish the effort to
acquire the dispositions required for full communion with God. Although
indulgences are in fact free gifts, nevertheless they are granted for the
living as well as for the dead only on determined conditions. To acquire
them, it is indeed required on the one hand that prescribed works be
performed, and on the other that the faithful have the necessary
dispositions, that is to say, that they love God, detest sin, place their
trust in the merits of Christ and believe firmly in the great assistance
they derive from the Communion of Saints.

<p>In addition, it should not be forgotten that by acquiring indulgences the
faithful submit docilely to the legitimate pastors of the Church and
above all to the successor of Blessed Peter, the keybearer of heaven, to
whom the Savior Himself entrusted the task of feeding His flock and
governing His Church.

<p>The salutary institution of indulgences therefore contributes in its own
way to bringing it about that the Church appear before Christ without
blemish or defect, but holy and immaculate,[45] admirably united with
Christ in the supernatural bond of charity. Since in fact by means of
indulgences members of the Church who are undergoing purification are
united more speedily to those of the Church in heaven, the kingdom of
Christ is through these same indulgences established more extensively and
more speedily "until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the
deep knowledge of the Son of God, to perfect manhood, to the mature
measure of the fullness of Christ."[46]

<p>11. Therefore Holy Mother Church, supported by these truths, while again
recommending to the faithful the practice of indulgences as something
very dear to the Christian people during the course of many centuries and
in our days as well--this is proven by experience--does not in any way
intend to diminish the value of other means of sanctification and
purification, first and foremost among which are the Sacrifice of the
Mass and the Sacraments, particularly the Sacrament of Penance. Nor does
it diminish the importance of those abundant aids which are called
sacramentals or of the works of piety, penitence and charity. All these
aids have this in common that they bring about sanctification and
purification all the more efficaciously, the more closely the faithful
are united with Christ the Head and the Body of the Church by charity.
The preeminence of charity in the Christian life is confirmed also by
indulgences. For indulgences cannot be acquired without a sincere
conversion of mentality ("metanoia") and unity with God, to which the
performance of the prescribed works is added. Thus the order of charity
is preserved, into which is incorporated the remission of punishment by
distribution from the Church's treasury.

<p>While recommending that its faithful not abandon or neglect the holy
traditions of their forebears but welcome them religiously as a precious
treasure of the Catholic family and duly esteem them, the Church
nevertheless leaves it to each to use these means of purification and
sanctification with the holy and free liberty of the sons of God. It
constantly reminds them, though, of those things which are to be given
preference because they are necessary or at least better and more
efficacious for the attainment of salvation.[47]

<p>Holy Mother Church has then deemed it fitting, in order to give greater
dignity and esteem to the use of indulgences, to introduce some
innovations into its discipline of indulgences and has accordingly
ordered the issuance of new norms.

<p><b>Chapter V</b>

<p>12. The following norms introduce appropriate variations in the
discipline of indulgences, taking into consideration the proposals
advanced by the episcopal conferences.

<p>The rulings of the Code of Canon Law and of the decrees of the Holy See
concerning indulgences which do not go counter to the new norms remain
unchanged.

<p>In drawing up the new norms these three considerations have been
particularly observed: to establish a new measurement for partial
indulgences; to reduce considerably the number of plenary indulgences;
and, as for the so-called "real" and "local" indulgences, to reduce them
and give them a simpler and more dignified formulation.

<p>Regarding partial indulgences, with the abolishment of the former
determination of days and years, a new norm or measurement has been
established which takes into consideration the action itself of the
faithful Christian who performs a work to which an indulgence is attached.

<p>Since by their acts the faithful can obtain, in addition to the merit
which is the principal fruit of the act, a further remission of temporal
punishment in proportion to the degree to which the charity of the one
performing the act is greater, and in proportion to the degree to which
the act itself is performed in a more perfect way, it has been considered
fitting that this remission of temporal punishment which the Christian
faithful acquire through an action should serve as the measurement for
the remission of punishment which the ecclesiastical authority
bountifully adds by way of partial indulgence.

<p>It has also been considered fitting to reduce appropriately the number of
plenary indulgences in order that the faithful may hold them in greater
esteem and may in fact acquire them with the proper dispositions. For
indeed the greater the proliferation (of indulgences) the less is the
attention given them; what is offered in abundance is not greatly
appreciated. Besides, many of the faithful need considerable time to
prepare themselves properly for acquisition of a plenary indulgence.

<p>As regards the "real" and "local" indulgences, not only has their number
been reduced considerably, but the designations themselves have been
abolished to make it clearer that indulgences are attached to the actions
performed by the faithful and not to objects or places which are but the
occasion for the acquisition of the indulgences. In fact, members of
pious associations can acquire the indulgences proper to their
associations without the requirement of the use of distinctive objects.

<p align=center><b>NORMS</b></p>

<p><b>Norm 1.</b> An indulgence is the remission before God of the temporal punishment
due sins already forgiven as far as their guilt is concerned, which the
follower of Christ with the proper dispositions and under certain
determined conditions acquires through the intervention of the Church
which, as minister of the Redemption, authoritatively dispenses and
applies the treasury of the satisfaction won by Christ and the saints.

<p><b>Norm 2.</b> An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either
part or all of the temporal punishment due sin.

<p><b>Norm 3.</b> Partial as well as plenary indulgences can always be applied to the
dead by way of suffrage.

<p><b>Norm 4.</b> A partial indulgence will henceforth be designated only with the
words "partial indulgence" without any determination of days or years.

<p><b>Norm 5.</b> The faithful who at least with a contrite heart perform an action to
which a partial indulgence is attached obtain, in addition to the
remission of temporal punishment acquired by the action itself, an equal
remission of punishment through the intervention of the Church.

<p><b>Norm 6.</b> A plenary indulgence can be acquired only once a day, except for the
provisions contained in n. 18 for those who are on the point of death. A
partial indulgence can be acquired more than once a day, unless there is
an explicit indication to the contrary.

<p><b>Norm 7.</b> To acquire a plenary indulgence it is necessary to perform the work
to which the indulgence is attached and to fulfill three conditions:
sacramental confession, Eucharistic Communion and prayer for the
intentions of the Supreme Pontiff. It is further required that all
attachment to sin, even to venial sin, be absent.

<p>If this disposition is in any way less than complete, or if the
prescribed three conditions are not fulfilled, the indulgence will be
only partial, except for the provisions contained in n. 11 for those who
are "impeded."

<p><b>Norm 8.</b> The three conditions may be fulfilled several days before or after
the performance of the prescribed work; nevertheless it is fitting that
Communion be received and the prayers for the intentions of the Supreme
Pontiff be said the same day the work is performed.

<p><b>Norm 9.</b> A single sacramental confession suffices for gaining several plenary
indulgences, but Communion must be received and prayers for the Supreme
Pontiff's intentions recited for the gaining of each plenary indulgence.

<p><b>Norm 10.</b> The condition of praying for the Supreme Pontiff's intentions is
fully satisfied by reciting one "Our Father" and one "Hail Mary";
nevertheless the individual faithful are free to recite any other prayer
according to their own piety and devotion toward the Supreme Pontiff.

<p><b>Norm 11.</b> While there is no change in the faculty granted by canon 935 of
the Code of Canon Law to confessors to commute for those who are
"impeded" either the prescribed work itself or the required conditions
[for the acquisition of indulgences], local Ordinaries can grant to the
faithful over whom they exercise authority in accordance with the law,
and who live in places where it is impossible or at least very difficult
for them to receive the sacraments of confession and Communion,
permission to acquire a plenary indulgence without confession and
Communion provided they are sorry for their sins and have the intention
of receiving these sacraments as soon as possible.

<p><b>Norm 12.</b> The division of indulgences into "personal," "real" and "local" is
abolished so as to make it clearer that indulgences are attached to the
actions of the faithful even though at times they may be linked with some
object or place.

<p><b>Norm 13.</b> The Enchiridion Indulgentiarium [collection of indulgenced prayers
and works] is to be revised with a view to attaching indulgences only to
the most important prayers and works of piety, charity and penance.

<p><b>Norm 14.</b> The lists and summaries of indulgences special to religious orders,
congregations, societies of those living in community without vows,
secular institutes and the pious associations of faithful are to be
revised as soon as possible in such a way that plenary indulgences may be
acquired only on particular days established by the Holy See acting on
the recommendation of the Superior General, or in the case of pious
associations, of the local Ordinary.

<p><b>Norm 15.</b> A plenary indulgence applicable only to the dead can be acquired in
all churches and public oratories--and in semipublic oratories by those
who have the right to use them--on November 2.

<p>In addition, a plenary indulgence can be acquired twice a year in parish
churches: on the feast of the church's titular saint and on August 2,
when the "Portiuncula" occurs, or on some other more opportune day
determined by the Ordinary.

<p>All the indulgences mentioned above can be acquired either on the days
established or--with the consent of the Ordinary--on the preceding or the
following Sunday.

<p>Other indulgences attached to churches and oratories are to be revised as
soon as possible.

<p><b>Norm 16.</b> The work prescribed for acquiring a plenary indulgence connected
with a church or oratory consists in a devout visit and the recitation of
an "Our Father" and "Creed."

<p><b>Norm 17.</b> The faithful who use with devotion an object of piety (crucifix,
cross, rosary, scapular or medal) properly blessed by any priest, can
acquire a partial indulgence.

<p>But if this object of piety is blessed by the Supreme Pontiff or any
bishop, the faithful who use it devoutly can also acquire a plenary
indulgence on the feast of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, provided
they also make a profession of faith using any legitimate formula.

<p><b>Norm 18.</b> To the faithful in danger of death who cannot be assisted by a
priest to bring them the sacraments and impart the apostolic blessing
with its attendant plenary indulgence (according to canon 468, para. 2 of
the Code of Canon Law) Holy Mother Church nevertheless grants a plenary
indulgence to be acquired at the point of death, provided they are
properly disposed and have been in the habit of reciting some prayers
during their lifetime. To use a crucifix or cross in connection with the
acquisition of this plenary indulgence is a laudable practice.

<p>This plenary indulgence at the point of death can be acquired by the
faithful even if they have already obtained another plenary indulgence on
the same day.

<p><b>Norm 19.</b> The norms established regarding plenary indulgences, particularly
those referred to in n.16, apply also to what up to now have been known
as the "toties quoties" ["as often as"] plenary indulgences.

<p><b>Norm 20.</b> Holy Mother Church, extremely solicitous for the faithful departed,
has decided that suffrages can be applied to them to the widest possible
extent at any Sacrifice of the Mass whatsoever, abolishing all special
privileges in this regard.

<p align=center><b>TRANSITIONAL NORMS</b></p>

<p>These new norms regulating the acquisition of indulgences will become
valid three months from the date of publication of this constitution in
the Acta Apostolicae Sedis.

<p>Indulgences attached to the use of religious objects which are not
mentioned above cease three months after the date of publication of this
constitution in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis.

<p>The revisions mentioned in n.14 and n.15 must be submitted to the
Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary within a year. Two years after the date of
this constitution, indulgences which have not been confirmed will become
null and void.

to state, the constitutions and apostolic directives published by our

special mention or should otherwise require partial repeal.

Our Lord Jesus Christ, 1967, the fourth year of Our Pontificate.
