<h1>Ingravescentibus Malis</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on the Rosary
<br>His Holiness Pope Pius XI
<br>Promulgated on September 29, 1937</b>

<p><i>To the Venerable Brethren, Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Holy See.</i>

<p>More than once have We asserted--and We recently repeated this in the
Encyclical Letter Divini Redemptoris (Acta Ap. Sedis, 1937, Vol. XXIX, p.
65)--that there is no remedy for the ever-growing evils of our times
except a return to Our Lord Jesus Christ and to His most holy precepts.
Truly, only He "hath the words of eternal life" (Cf. John, vi, 69), and
individuals and society can only fall into immediate and miserable ruin
if they ignore the majesty of God and repudiate His Law.

<p>2. However, anyone who studies with diligence the records of the Catholic
Church will easily recognize that the true patronage of the Virgin Mother
of God is linked with all the annals of the Christian name. When, in
fact, errors everywhere diffused were bent upon rending the seamless robe
of the Church and upon throwing the Catholic world into confusion, our
fathers turned with confident soul to her "alone who destroys all
heresies in the world" (Roman Breviary), and the victory won through her
brought the return of tranquillity.

<p>3. When the impious Mohammedan power, trusting in its powerful fleet and
war-hardened armies, threatened the peoples of Europe with ruin and
slavery, then--upon the suggestion of the Sovereign Pontiff--the
protection of the heavenly Mother was fervently implored and the enemy
was defeated and his ships sunk. Thus the Faithful of every age, both in
public misfortune and in private need, turn in supplication to Mary, the
benignant, so that she may come to their aid and grant help and remedy
against sorrows of body and soul. And never was her most powerful aid
hoped for in vain by those who besought it with pious and trustful prayer.

<p>4. But also in our day, dangers no less grave than in the past beset
civil and religious society. In fact, because the supreme and eternal
authority of God, which commands and forbids, is despised and completely
repudiated by men, the result is that the consciousness of Christian duty
is weakened, and that faith becomes tepid in souls or entirely lost, and
his afterward affects and ruins the very basis of human society.

<p>5. Thus on the one hand are seen citizens intent on an atrocious struggle
among themselves because some are provided with abundant riches and
others must gain bread for themselves and their dear ones by the sweat of
their brows. Indeed, as we all know, in some regions the evil had reached
such a pitch that it seeks to destroy all private right of property, so
that everything might be shared in common.

<p>6. On the other hand, there are not lacking men who declare that they
honor and exalt, above all, the power of the State. They say they must
use every means to assure civil order and enforce authority, and pretend
that only thus are they able totally to repulse the execrable theories of
the Communists. However, they despise the light of evangelic wisdom and
endeavor to revive the errors of the pagans and their way of life.

<p>7. To this is added the clever and lamentable sect of those who, denying
and hating God, declare themselves the enemies of the Eternal, and who
insinuate themselves everywhere. They discredit and uproot all religious
belief from souls. Finally, they trample on every human and Divine right.
And while they cast scorn on the hope of heavenly reward, they incite men
to seek, even by illicit means, false earthly happiness, and therefore
drive them with brazen temerity to the dissolution of the social order,
causing disorder, cruel rebellions and even the conflagration of civil
war.

<p>8. Nevertheless, Venerable Brethren, though such great and numerous evils
hang over us, and others still greater are to be feared for the future,
we must not lose heart nor let the confident hope that rests solely on
God become fainter. He who "made the nations of the earth for health"
(Cf. Wisdom i, 14) without doubt will not let those perish whom He has
redeemed with His Precious Blood, nor will He abandon His Church. But
rather, as We said in the beginning, shall We beseech God through the
mediation of the Blessed Virgin, so acceptable to Him, since, to use the
words of St. Bernard: "Such is the will of God, who has wished that we
should have all things through Mary." (Sermon on the Nativity of the
Blessed Virgin Mary.)

<p>9. Among the various supplications with which we successfully appeal to
the Virgin Mother of God, the Holy Rosary without doubt occupies a
special and distinct place. This prayer, which some call the Psalter of
the Virgin or Breviary of the Gospel and of Christian life, was described
and recommended by Our Predecessor of happy memory, Leo XIII, with these
vigorous passages: "Very admirable is this crown interwoven with the
angelic salutation which is interposed in the Sunday prayer, and unites
with it the obligation of interior meditation. It is an excellent manner
of prayer . . . and very useful for the attainment of immortal life"
(Acta Leonis, 1898, Vol. XVIII, pp.

<p>154, 155).

<p>10. And this can well be deduced from the very flowers that form this
mystic garland. What prayers in fact can be found more adaptable and
holy? This first is that which our Divine Redeemer Himself pronounced
when His disciples asked Him: "Lord, teach us to pray" (Luke xi, 1); a
very holy supplication which both offers us the way--as far as it is
possible for us--to render glory to God, and also takes into account all
the necessities of our body and soul. How can the Eternal Father, when
prayed to with the very words of His Son, refuse to come to our aid?

<p>11. The other prayer is the Angelic Salutation, which begins with the
eulogies of the Archangel Gabriel and of St. Elizabeth, and ends with
that very pious supplication by which we beg the help of the Blessed
Virgin now and at the hour of our death. To these invocations, said
aloud, is added the contemplation of the sacred mysteries, through which
they place, as it were, under our eyes the joys, sorrows and triumphs of
Jesus Christ and of His Mother, so that we receive relief and comfort in
our sorrows. Following those most holy examples, we ascend to the
happiness of the heavenly country by steps of ever higher virtue.

<p>12. This practice of piety, Venerable Brethren, admirably diffused by St.
Dominic, not without the heavenly suggestion and inspiration of the
Virgin Mother of God, is without doubt easy for all, even for the
ignorant and the simple. But those wander from the path of truth who
consider this devotion merely an annoying formula repeated with
monotonous singsong intonation, and refuse it as good only for children
and silly women!

<p>13. In this regard, it is to be noted that both piety and love, though
always renewing the same words, do not always repeat the same thing but
always express something new issuing from the intimate sentiment of
devotion. And besides, this mode of prayer has the perfume of evangelic
simplicity and requires humility of spirit; and, if we disdain humility,
as the Divine Redeemer teaches, it will be impossible for us to enter the
heavenly kingdom: "Amen, I say to you, unless you become as little
children you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. xviii, 3).

<p>14. Nevertheless, if men in our century, with its derisive pride, refuse
the Holy Rosary, there is an innumerable multitude of holy men of every
age and every condition who have always held it dear. They have recited
it with great devotion, and in every moment they have used it as a
powerful weapon to put the demons to flight, to preserve the integrity of
life, to acquire virtue more easily, and in a word to attain real peace
among men.

<p>15. Nor are there lacking men famous as to doctrine and wisdom who,
although intensely occupied in scientific study and researches, never
even for a day fail to pray fervently on bended knee, before the image of
the Virgin, in this most pious form. Thus kings and princes, however
burdened with most urgent occupations and affairs, made it their duty to
recite the Rosary.

<p>16. This mystic crown, then, not only is found in and glides through the
hands of the poor, but it also is honored by citizens of every social
rank. And We do not wish here to pass over in silence the fact that the
Blessed Virgin herself, even in our times, has solicitously recommended
this manner of prayer, when she appeared and taught it to the innocent
girl in the Grotto of Lourdes.

<p>17. Therefore why should We not hope for every grace if We supplicate Our
Heavenly Mother in this manner with due disposition and holiness? We
desire very earnestly, Venerable Brethren, that the Holy Rosary should be
recited in a special manner in the month of October and with increased
devotion both in the churches and in homes.

<p>18. And so much the more must it be done since the enemies of the Divine
Name--that is, those who have rebelled against and denied and scorned the
Eternal God--spread snares for the Catholic Faith and the liberty due to
the Church, and finally rebel with insane efforts against divine and
human rights, to send mankind to ruin and perdition. Through efficacious
recourse to the Virgin Mother of God, they may be finally bent and led to
penance and return to the straight path, trusting to the care and
protection of Mary.

<p>19. The Holy Virgin who once victoriously drove the terrible sect of the
Albigenses from Christian countries, now suppliantly invoked by us, will
turn aside the new errors, especially those of Communism, which reminds
us in many ways, in its motives and misdeeds, of the ancient ones.

<p>20. And as in the times of the Crusades, in all Europe there was raised
one voice of the people, one supplication; so today, in all the world,
the cities, and even the smallest villages, united with courage and
strength, with filial and constant insistence, the people seek to obtain
from the great Mother of God the defeat of the enemies of Christian and
human civilization, to the end that true peace may shine again over tired
and erring men.

<p>21. If, then, all will do this with due disposition, with great faith and
with fervent piety, it is right to hope that as in the past, so in our
day, the Blessed Virgin will obtain from her divine Son that the waves of
the present tempests be calmed and that a brilliant victory crown this
rivalry of Christians in prayer.

<p>22. The Holy Rosary, besides, not only serves admirably to overcome the
enemies of God and Religion, but is also a stimulus and spur to the
practice of evangelic virtues which it injects and cultivates in our
souls. Above all, it nourishes the Catholic Faith, which flourishes again
by due meditation on the sacred mysteries, and raises minds to the truth
revealed to us by God.

<p>23. Every one can understand how salutary it is, especially in our times
wherein sometimes a certain annoyance of the things of the spirit is felt
even among the Faithful, and a dislike, as it were, for the Christian
doctrine. Therefore, revive the hope of immortal welfare, while the
triumph of Jesus Christ and of His Mother, meditated on by us in the last
part of the Rosary, shows us Heaven open and invites us to the conquest
of the Eternal Country.

<p>24. Thus while an unbridled longing for the things of this earth has
penetrated into the hearts of mortals and each one more ardently longs
for the short-lived riches and ephemeral pleasures, all feel a fruitful
call back to the heavenly treasures "where thieves do not break in and
neither rust nor moth doth consume" (Matt. xii, 33), and to the wealth
that will never perish.

<p>25. And the charity which has been weakened and cooled in many, how can
it fail to be rekindled into love in the souls of those who recall with a
full heart the tortures and death of our Redeemer and the afflictions of
His Sorrowful Mother? From this charity towards God, then, there cannot
but rise a more intense love of one's neighbor if one dwells on the
labors and sorrows that Our Lord suffered for all, reinstating the lost
inheritance of the children of God.

<p>26. Therefore see to it, Venerable Brethren, that such a fruitful
practice shall be more diffused, more highly esteemed by all, and that
common piety be increased. Through your work and that of the priests who
help you in the care of souls, its praises and advantages shall be
preached and repeated to the Faithful of every social class.

<p>27. From it, the young will draw fresh energy with which to control the
rebellious tendencies to evil and to preserve intact the stainless purity
of the soul; also in it, the old will again find repose, relief and peace
from their anxious cares. To those who devote themselves to Catholic
Action may it be a spur to impel them to a more fervent and active work
of apostolate; and to all those who suffer in any way, especially the
dying, may it bring comfort and increase the hope of eternal happiness.

<p>28. The fathers and mothers of families particularly must give an example
to their children, especially when, at sunset, they gather together after
the day's work, within the domestic walls, and recite the Holy Rosary on
bended knees before the image of the Virgin, together fusing voice, faith
and sentiment. This is a beautiful and salutary custom, from which
certainly there cannot but be derived tranquillity and abundance of
heavenly gifts for the household.

<p>29. When very frequently We receive newly married couples in audience and
address paternal words to them, We give them rosaries, We recommend these
to them earnestly, and We exhort them, citing Our own example, not to let
even one day pass without saying the Rosary, no matter how burdened they
may be with many cares and labors.

<p>30. For these reasons, Venerable Brethren, We have thought fit earnestly
to exhort you, and through you, all the Faithful, to carry out this pious
practice. Nor do We doubt that you, listening, with your usual response
to Our paternal invitation will bring about abundant fruits once more.

<p>31. And in addressing this Encyclical to you, another motive impels Us.
We wish that, together with Us, Our many children in Jesus shall unite
and render thanks to the Mother of God for the better health We have
happily regained.

<p>32. This grace, as We have had occasion to write (Cf. Letter to Cardinal
E. Pacelli, Osservatore Romano, September 5, 1937), We attribute to the
special intercession of the virgin of Lisieux, St. Therese of the Child
Jesus. But We know, though, that everything comes to us from Almighty God
through the hands of Our Lady.

<p>33. And lastly, as there has been launched in the public press with rash
insolence, a very grave injury to the Blessed Virgin, We cannot do less
than profit by this occasion to offer, together with the Episcopate and
the people of that nation which venerates Mary as "Queen of the Kingdom
of Poland," and with the homage of our piety, due reparation to the
august Queen, and denounce to the whole world this sacrilege committed
with impunity, as a painful and unworthy thing.

<p>34. Meanwhile, with a full heart We impart to you, Venerable Brethren,
and to the flock entrusted to the care of each of you, the Apostolic
Blessing as an augury of heavenly graces and in token to Our Paternal
benevolence.

<p>Given at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, on the 29th day of the month of
September, on the Feast of the Dedication of St. Michael the Archangel,
in the year 1937, the sixteenth of Our Pontificate.
