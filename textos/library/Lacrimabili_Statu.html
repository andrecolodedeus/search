<h1>Lacrimabili Statu</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on the Indians of South America
<br>His Holiness Pope Pius X
<br>June 7, 1912</b>

<p><i>To the Archbishops and Bishops of Latin America.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Being greatly moved by the deplorable condition of the Indians in Lower
America, our illustrious predecessor Benedict XIV pleaded their cause, as
you are aware, in most weighty words, in his letter "Immensa Pastorum,"
given on December 22, 1741; and since we also have to deplore in many
places almost the same things that he then lamented, we most earnestly
recall those letters of his to your memory. For therein, among other
things, Pope Benedict complained that although the Apostolic See had done
much, and for a long time, to relieve their afflicted fortunes, there were
even the "men of the orthodox faith who, as if they had utterly forgotten
all sense of the charity poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
presumed to reduce the wretched Indians, without the light of faith, and
even those who had been washed in the laver of regeneration, to servitude,
or to sell them as slaves to others, or to deprive them of their property,
and to treat them with such inhumanity that they were thus greatly hindered
from embracing the Christian faith, and most strongly moved to regard it
with abhorrence." It is true that soon afterwards the worst of these
indignities--that is to say, slavery, properly so called--was, by the
goodness of the merciful God, abolished; and to this public abolition of
slavery in Brazil and in other regions the excellent men who governed those
Republics were greatly moved and encouraged by the maternal care and
insistence of the Church. And we gladly acknowledge that if it had not been
for many and great obstacles that stood in the way, their plans would have
had far greater success. Nevertheless, though much has thus been done for
the Indians, there is much more that still remains to be done. And, indeed,
when we consider the crimes and outrages still committed against them, our
heart is filled with horror, and we are moved to great compassion for its
most unhappy race. For what can be so cruel and so barbarous as to scourge
men and brand them with hot iron, often for most trivial causes, often for
a mere lust of cruelty; or, having suddenly overthrown them, to slay
hundreds or thousands in one unceasing massacre; or to waste villages and
districts and slaughter the inhabitants, so that some tribes, as we
understand, have become extinct in these last few years?

<p>2. The lust of lucre has done much to make the minds of men so barbarous.
But something also is due to the nature of the climate and the situation of
these regions. For, as these places are subjected to burning southern sun,
which casts a languor into the veins and as it were, destroys the vigor of
virtue, and as they are far removed from the habits of religion and the
vigilance of the State, and in a measure even from civil society, it easily
comes to pass that those who have not already come there with evil morals
soon begin to be corrupted, and then, when all bonds of right and duty are
broken, they fall away into all hateful vices. Nor in this do they take any
pity on the weakness of sex or age, so that we are ashamed to mention the
crimes and outrages they commit in seeking out and selling women and
children, wherein it may be truly said that they have surpassed the worst
examples of pagan iniquity.

<p>3. For our part, indeed, when reports of these things were first brought to
us, we hesitated for some time to give credence to such atrocities, since
they certainly seemed to be incredible. But after we had been assured by
abundant witnesses--to wit, by many of yourselves, Venerable Brethren, by
the Delegates of the Apostolic See, by the missioners, and by other men
wholly worthy of belief--we can no longer have any doubt as to the truth of
these statements.

<p>4. Now, therefore, having pondered long on this matter, so that, as far as
lies in our power, we may endeavor to remedy such great evils, with humble
and suppliant prayer we beg of God that He may deign in His goodness to
show us some opportune way of healing these wounds. For He Himself, Who is
the most loving Maker and Redeemer of all mankind, since He has given us
this desire of laboring for the saving of the Indians, will also assuredly
give us those things that conduce to this end. Meanwhile, it greatly
consoles us to know that those who bear rule in these Republics are making
every endeavor to remove this outstanding disgrace and this stain from
their States; which endeavors, indeed, we cannot sufficiently praise and
approve. Since, however, these regions are far from the seats of
Government, and are for the most part not readily accessible, these human
endeavors of the civil powers, whether from the craft of the criminals, who
can speedily cross the frontiers, or through the inactivity or perfidy of
the officials, often do little good, and sometimes come to nothing. But if
the work of the Church is added to the work of the State, then at length
the desired fruit shall be obtained in greater abundance.

<p>5. Wherefore, Venerable Brethren, we call upon you, before all others, to
give special care and thought to this cause, which is in every way worthy
of your pastoral office and duty. And leaving the rest to your solicitude
and diligence, we particularly urge you to foster and promote all the good
works instituted in your dioceses for the benefit of the Indians, and to
see that other works likely to contribute to this end may be instituted. In
the next place you will diligently admonish your flocks on their most
sacred duty of helping religious missions to the natives who first
inhabited the American soil. Let them know that they ought to help this
work especially in two ways, to wit, by their gifts and by their prayers;
and that it is not only their religion, but their country also, that asks
this of them. Do you, moreover, take care that wheresoever moral
instruction is given, in seminaries, in colleges, in convent schools, and
more especially in the churches, Christian charity, which holds all men,
without distinction of nation or color, as true brethren, shall be
continually preached and commended. And this charity must be made manifest
not so much by words as by deeds. Moreover, every opportunity must be taken
to show what a great dishonor is done to the Christian name by these base
deeds, which we are here denouncing.

<p>6. As for our part, having good reason to hope for the consent and support
of the public authorities, we have more especially taken care to extend the
field of Apostolic labor in these broad regions, appointing further
missionary stations, where the Indians can find safety and succor. For the
Catholic Church has ever been a fertile mother of Apostolic men, who,
pressed by the charity of Christ, are brought to give their lives for their
brethren. And to-day, when so many abhor the faith or fall away from it,
the zeal for spreading the Gospel among the barbarous nations is still
strong in the clergy and in religious men and holy virgins; and this zeal
grows greater and is spread abroad more widely by the power of the Holy
Ghost, who helps the Church, His spouse, according to the needs of the
time. Wherefore, we think it well to make greater use of those aids which
by God's goodness are ready to our hand, in order to deliver the Indians,
where their need is greatest. from the slavery of Satan and of wicked men.
For the rest, since the preachers of the Gospel had watered these regions,
not only with their sweat, but sometimes with their blood, we trust that at
length a fair harvest of Christian kindness shall spring forth from their
great labors and bear abundant fruit. And now, in order that what you shall
do for the benefit of the Indians, whether of your own accord or at our
exhortation, may be the more efficacious by the help of our Apostolic
authority, we, mindful of the example of our aforesaid predecessor, condemn
and declare guilty of grave crime whosoever, as he says, "shall dare or
presume to reduce the said Indians to slavery, to sell them, to buy them,
to exchange or give them, to separate them from their wives and children,
to deprive them of goods and chattels, to transport or send them to other
places, or in any way whatsoever to rob them of freedom and hold them in
slavery; or to give counsel, help, favor, and work on any pretext of color
to them that do these things, or to preach or teach that it is lawful, or
to co-operate therewith in any way whatever." Accordingly, we will that the
power of absolving penitents in the sacramental tribunal from these crimes
shall be reserved to ordinaries of the localities.

<p>7. It has seemed well to us, moved by our paternal affection and following
the footsteps of your predecessors, among whom we may specially mention Leo
XIII, of blessed memory, to write these things to you, Venerable Brethren,
on the case of the Indians. But it will be for you to strive according to
your strength to give abundant satisfaction to our desires. You will
assuredly be helped in this by those who bear rule in these Republics; nor
will you want the work and care of the clergy, especially those devoted to
the sacred missions; and, lastly, all good men will be with you, and those
who can, with gifts or other offices of charity, will help a cause in which
both religion and the dignity of manhood are involved. And, what is the
chief thing, the grace of Almighty God will be with you, in token whereof
and as a pledge of our goodwill, we most lovingly impart new Apostolic
benediction to you, Venerable Brethren, and to your flocks.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, on the 7th of June, 1912, in the ninth year
of our Pontificate.
