<h1>Letter of October 28, 1995</h1>  
<p><b>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
<br>Regarding the SCDF Responsum on Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</b>

<p>THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPLY of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith to a <i>dubium</i> regarding the reason for which the teaching contained
in the Apostolic Letter <i><a href="../library/docs_jp02os.htm">Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</a></i> is to be considered
<i>definitive tenenda</i> seems the appropriate moment to offer certain
reflections.
<p>The ecclesiological significance of this Apostolic Letter was underscored
even by its date of publication, for it was on that day, May 22, 1994, that the
Church celebrated the Solemnity of Pentecost. Its importance, however, could
be discovered above all in the concluding words of the Letter: "in order that
all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance, a matter which
pertains to the Church's divine constitution itself, in virtue of my ministry
of confirming the brethren (cf. Lk 22:32) I declare that the Church has no
authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this
judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful" (n. 4).
<p>The Pope's intervention was necessary not simply to reiterate the validity
of a discipline observed in the Church from the beginning, but to confirm a
doctrine "preserved by the constant and universal Tradition of the Church and
firmly taught by the Magisterium in its more recent documents," which "pertains
to the Church's divine consitution itself" (n. 4). In this way, the Holy
Father intended to make clear that the teaching that priestly ordination is
to be reserved solely to men could not be considered "open to debate" and
neither could one attribute to the decision of the Church "a merely
disciplinary force" (ibid).
<p>The fruits of this Letter have been evident since its publication. Many
consciences which in good faith had been disturbed, more by doubt than by
uncertainty, found serenity once again thanks to the teaching of the Holy
Father. However, some perplexity continued, not only among those who, distant
from the Catholic faith, do not accept the existence of a doctrinal authority
within the Church -- that is, a Magisterium sacramentally invested with the
authority of Christ (cf. <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, 21) -- but also among some of
the faithful to whom it continued to seem that the exclusion of women from the
priestly ministry represents a form of injustice or discrimination against them.
Some objected that it is not evident from Revelation that such an exclusion was
the will of Christ for his Church, and others had questions concerning the
assent owed to the Letter.
<p>Certainly, the understanding of the reasons for which the Church does not
have the power to confer priestly ordination on women can be deepened further.
Such reasons, for example, have been set out already in the Declaration
<i><a href="../library/docs_df76ii.htm">Inter Insigniores</a></i> (October 15, 1976), issued by the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope Paul VI, and in a number of
the documents of John Paul II (for example, <i>Christifideles Laici</i>, 51;
<i>Mulieris Dignitatem</i>, 26), as well as in the <i>Catechism of the Catholic
Church</i>, No. 1577). But in any case it cannot be forgotten that the Church
teaches, as an absolutely fundamental truth of Christian anthropology, the
equal personal dignity of men and women, and the necessity of overcoming and
doing away with "every type of discrimination regarding fundamental rights"
(<i>Gaudium et Spes</i>, 29). It is in the light of this truth that one can
seek to understand better the teaching that women cannot receive priestly
ordination. A correct theology can prescind neither from one nor from the
other of these doctrines, but must hold the two together; only thus will it be
able to deepen our comprehension of God's plan regarding woman and regarding
the priesthood -- and hence, regarding the mission of woman in the Church. If
however, perhaps by allowing oneself to be conditioned too much by the ways and
spirit of the age, one should assert that a contradiction exists between these
two truths, the way of progress in the intelligence of the faith would be lost.
<p>In the Letter <i><a href="../library/docs_jp02os.htm">Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</a></i> the Pope focuses attention on
the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and Mother of the Church.
The fact that she "received neither the mission proper to the Apostles nor the
ministerial priesthood clearly shows that the non-admission of women to
priestly ordination cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity, nor can it be
construed as discrimination against them" (n. 3). Diversity of mission in no
way compromises equality of personal dignity.
<p>Furthermore, to understand that this teaching implies no injustice or
discrimination against women, one has to consider the nature of the ministerial
priesthood itself, which is a service and not a position of privilege or human
power over others. Whoever, man or woman, conceives of the priesthood in terms
of personal affirmation, as a goal or point of departure in a career of human
success, is profoundly mistaken, for the true meaning of Christian priesthood,
whether it be the common priesthood of the faithful or, in a most special way,
the ministerial priesthood, can only be found in the sacrifice of one's own
being in union with Christ, in service of the brethren. Priestly ministry
constitutes neither the universal ideal nor, even less, the goal of Christian
life. In this connection, it is helpful to recall once again that "the only
higher gift, which can and must be desired, is charity" (cf. 1 Cor. 12:13;
<i><a href="../library/docs_df76ii.htm">Inter Insigniores</a></i>).
<p>With respect to its foundation in Sacred Scripture and in Tradition, John
Paul II directs his attention to the fact that the Lord Jesus, as is witnessed
by the New Testament, called only men, and not women, to the ordained
ministry, and that the Apostles "did the same when they chose fellow workers
who would succeed them in their ministry" (n. 2; cf. 1 Tim. 3:1ff; 2 Tim. 1:6;
Tit. 1:5). There are sound arguments supporting the fact that Christ's way
of acting was not determined by cultural motives (cf. n. 2), as there are also
sufficient grounds to state that Tradition has interpreted the choice made by
the Lord as binding for the Church of all times.
<p>Here, however, we find ourselves before the essential interdependence of
Holy Scripture and Tradition, an interdependence which makes of these two forms
of the transmission of the Gospel an unbreakable unity with the Magisterium,
which is an integral part of Tradition and is entrusted with the authentic
interpretation of the Word of God, written and handed down (<i>Dei Verbum</i>,
9 and 10). In the specific case of priestly ordination, the successors of the
Apostles have always observed the norm of conferring it only on men, and the
Magisterium, assisted by the Holy Spirit, teaches us that this did not occur
by chance, habitual repetition, subjection to sociological conditioning, or
even less because of some imaginary inferiority of women; but rather because
"the Church has always acknowledged as a perennial norm her Lord's way of
acting in choosing the twelve men whom he made the foundation of his Church"
(n. 2).
<p>As is well known, there are reasons <i>ex convenientia</i> by which theology
has sought and seeks to understand the reasonableness of the will of the Lord.
Such reasons, expounded for example in the Declaration <i><a href="../library/docs_df76ii.htm">Inter Insigniores</a></i>,
have their undoubted value, and yet they are not conceived or employed as if
they were strictly logical proofs derived from absolute principles. At the
same time, it is important to keep in mind, as these reasons help us to
comprehend, that the human will of Christ not only is not arbitrary, but that
it is intimately united with the divine will of the eternal Son, on which the
ontological and anthropological truth of the creation of the two sexes depends.
<p>In response to this precise act of the Magisterium of the Roman Pontiff,
explicitly addressed to the entire Catholic Church, all members of the faithful
are required to give their assent to the teaching stated therein. To this end,
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, with the approval of the Holy
Father, has given an official Reply on the nature of this assent; it is a
matter of full definitive assent, that is to say, irrevocable, to a doctrine
taught infallibly by the Church. In fact, as the Reply explains, the definitive
nature of this assent derives from the truth of the doctrine itself, since,
founded on the written Word of God, and constantly held and applied in the
Tradition of the Church, it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary
universal Magisterium (cf. <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, 25). Thus, the Reply
specifies that this doctrine belongs to the deposit of the faith of the
Church. It should be emphasized that the definitive and infallible nature of
this teaching of the Church did not arise with the publication of the Letter
<i><a href="../library/docs_jp02os.htm">Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</a></i>. In the Letter, as the Reply of the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith also explains, the Roman Pontiff, having taken
account of present circumstances, has confirmed the same teaching by a formal
declaration, giving expression once again to <i>quod semper, quod ubique et
quod ab omnibus tenendum est, utpote ad fidei depositum pertinens</i>. In this
case, an act of the ordinary Papal Magisterium, in itself not infallible,
witnesses to the infallibility of the teaching of a doctrine already possessed
by the Church.
<p>Finally, there have been some commentaries on the Letter <i><a href="../library/docs_jp02os.htm">Ordinatio
Sacerdotalis</a></i> which have suggested that the document constitutes an
additional and inopportune obstacle on the already difficult path of
ecumenism. In this regard, it should not be forgotten that according to both
the letter and the spirit of the Second Vatican Council (cf. <i>Unitatis
Redintegratio</i>, 11), the authentic ecumenical task, to which the Catholic
Church is unequivocally and permanently committed, requires complete
sincerity and clarity in the presentation of one's own faith. Furthermore,
it should be noted that the doctrine reaffirmed by the Letter <i><a href="../library/docs_jp02os.htm">Ordinatio
Sacerdotalis</a></i> cannot but fther the pursuit of full communion with the
Orthodox Churches which, in fidelity to Tradition, have maintained and continue
to maintain the same teaching.
<p>The singular originality of the Church and of the priestly ministry within
the Church requires a precise clarity of criteria. Concretely, one must never
lose sight of the fact that the Church does not find the source of her faith
and her constitutive structure in the principles of the social order of any
historical period. While attentive to the world in which she lives and for
whose salvation she labours, the Church is conscious of being the bearer of
a higher fidelity to which she is bound. It is a question of a radical
faithfulness to the Word of God which she has received from Christ who
established her to last until the end of the ages. This Word of God, in
proclaiming the essential value and eternal destiny of every person, reveals
the ultimate foundation of the dignity of every human being, of every woman
and of every man.
