<h1>Magni Nobis</h1>  
<p><b>On the Catholic University of America
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>March 7, 1889</b>

<p>To the Archbishops and Bishops of the United States of North America.

<p>OF GREAT JOY TO US is your zealous regard for the welfare of your dioceses
by insuring protection of Catholic piety. We are especially comforted by
the bulwark you are erecting for the proper education of clerical and lay
youth and instruction in the divine and human sciences related to the Rule
of Faith. Your most welcome letter, sent us at the beginning of last year,
is truly inspiring wherein you indicate that the construction of the Lyceum
or University of Studies in the City of Washington is progressing so
felicitously that, due to your diligence, everything will be ready for the
teaching of theology this year. From our esteemed brother, John Keane,
titular bishop of Jassus and rector of this same University, whom you sent
us, we have received with pleasure the statutes and laws of your University
which you submitted to our judgment and authority. The wisdom of your
decision is most praiseworthy to commemorate the auspicious centennial of
the establishment of the American hierarchy with the opportune dedication
of your University.

<p>2. We, on our part, have not delayed to fulfill your desires and have
entrusted the constitutions of your University to a committee of cardinals
selected from the sacred Christian council, the Propaganda, for examination
and evaluation. Now with their decision before us, we happily assent to
your requests and with this present letter approve by our authority the
laws and statutes of your University and endow it with the rights proper to
a lawfully constituted University. We likewise empower your school of
higher studies to confer all academic degrees upon those students whose
learning has been tested and approved, and also graduate degrees in
philosophy, theology and canon law and in those other departments in which
the different degrees and doctorates are usually conferred, whenever those
faculties will have been established.

<p>3. We desire, furthermore, our beloved son and venerable brothers, that you
or competent bishops appointed by you vigilantly superintend the
preservation of the correct system of studies and the discipline of
students in your academic institution. Since, moreover, the principal See
of the United States of North America is in Baltimore, We confer on the
Archbishop of Baltimore and his successors the office and authority of
chancellor or chief academic controller.

<p>4. It is also Our wish that for a safeguard the traditional course of
studies or program of disciplines of your University, and especially
insofar as they pertain to philosophy and theology, be presented to this
Holy See for examination to insure our consistent and valid approval. In
addition, We desire that every department of learning in this same
University be so constituted that clerical and lay youth may have equal
opportunity to fulfill a novel desire for knowledge. We wish, moreover,
that in your program of studies a school of pontifical canon law be set up,
for We deem such knowledge very important and particularly in our times.

<p>We urge you all, on the other hand, to be sure that your seminaries,
colleges and other Catholic institutions be affiliated with the University
as suggested in its statutes, but, however, without impairment of their
autonomy.

<p>5. In order that as many as possible may enjoy more abundantly the benefits
of the teaching of the University in its various faculties, let these
schools of philosophy and theology devotedly serve not only those who have
completed their studies according to the decrees of the Third Plenary
Council of Baltimore, but also those who wish to begin or continue their
studies.

<p>6. Truly, since this great University of higher studies not only brings
increased glory to your country, but promises salutary benefits in the
propagation of sound doctrine and in the protection of Catholic piety, we
are justly confident that the American faithful in their liberality will
not disappoint you in bringing to magnificent completion the work they have
so generously begun.

<p>7. As the University at Washington is established by this letter, we desire
that no other institution of this nature shall be undertaken by anyone
without consulting the Apostolic See.

<p>8. We believe that the message of this Our letter is evident proof to you
of our sincere solicitude that the glorious progress of the Catholic
religion increase daily in your country. We beseech most merciful God from
whom comes every good endowment and every perfect gift without variation
(Jas 1.17) to grant the prayers of your faithful and bless your project
with favorable and happy issue.

<p>9. With best wishes We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Blessing as a
testimony of Our sincere love for you, Our beloved son, and you, Our
venerable brothers, and the clergy and faithful whom you watch over, as a
token of all heavenly gifts.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, 7 March, 1889, on the feast of
 Thomas Aquinas in the twelfth year of Our Pontificate.
