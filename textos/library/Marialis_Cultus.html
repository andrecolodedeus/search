<p><b>Apostolic Exhortation
<br>For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary
<br>His Holiness Pope Paul VI
<br>Promulgated on February 2, 1974</b>

<p><i>To All Bishops in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See</i>

<p>Venerable Brothers: Health and the Apostolic Blessing.

<p>FROM THE MOMENT when we were called to the See of Peter, we have
constantly striven to enhance devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, not
only with the intention of interpreting the sentiments of the Church and
our own personal inclination but also because, as is well known, this
devotion forms a very noble part of the whole sphere of that sacred
worship in which there intermingle the highest expressions of wisdom and
of religion[1] and which is therefore the primary task of the People of God.

<p>Precisely with a view to this task, we have always favored and encouraged
the great work of liturgical reform promoted by the Second Vatican
Ecumenical Council; and it has certainly come about not without a
particular design of divine Providence that the first conciliar document
which together with the venerable Fathers we approved and signed in
Spiritu Sancto was the Constitution Sacrosanctum concilium. The purpose
of this document was precisely to restore and enhance the liturgy and to
make more fruitful the participation of the faithful in the sacred
mysteries.[2] From that time onwards, many acts of our pontificate have
been directed towards the improvement of divine worship, as is
demonstrated by the fact that we have promulgated in these recent years
numerous books of the Roman Rite, restored according to the principles
and norms of the same Council. For this we profoundly thank the Lord, the
giver of all good things, and we are grateful to the episcopal
conferences and individual bishops who in various ways have collaborated
with us in the preparation of these books.

<p>We contemplate with joy and gratitude the work so far accomplished and
the first positive results of the liturgical renewal, destined as they
are to increase as this renewal comes to be understood in its basic
purposes and correctly applied. At the same time we do not cease with
vigilant solicitude to concern ourself with whatever can give orderly
fulfillment to the renewal of the worship with which the Church in spirit
and truth (cf. Jn. 4:24) adores the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit, "venerates with special love Mary the most holy Mother of God"[3]
 and honors with religious devotion the memory of the martyrs and the
other saints.

<p>The development, desired by us, of devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is
an indication of the Church's genuine piety. This devotion fits--as we
have indicated above--into the only worship that is rightly called
"Christian," because it takes its origin and effectiveness from Christ,
finds its complete expression in Christ, and leads through Christ in the
Spirit to the Father. In the sphere of worship this devotion necessarily
reflects God's redemptive plan, in which a special form of veneration is
appropriate to the singular place which Mary occupies in that plan.[4]
Indeed every authentic development of Christian worship is necessarily
followed by a fitting increase of veneration for the Mother of the Lord.
Moreover, the history of piety shows how "the various forms of devotion
towards the Mother of God that the Church has approved within the limits
of wholesome and orthodox doctrine"[5] have developed in harmonious
subordination to the worship of Christ, and have gravitated towards this
worship as to their natural and necessary point of reference. The same is
happening in our own time. The Church's reflection today on the mystery
of Christ and on her own nature has led her to find at the root of the
former and as a culmination of the latter the same figure of a woman: the
Virgin Mary, the Mother of Christ and the Mother of the Church. And the
increased knowledge of Mary's mission has become joyful veneration of her
and adoring respect for the wise plan of God, who has placed within His
family (the Church), as in every home, the figure of a Woman, who in a
hidden manner and in a spirit of service watches over that family "and
carefully looks after it until the glorious day of the Lord."[6]

<p>In our time, the changes that have occurred in social behavior, people's
sensibilities, manners of expression in art and letters and in the forms
of social communication have also influenced the manifestations of
religious sentiment. Certain practices of piety that not long ago seemed
suitable for expressing the religious sentiment of individuals and of
Christian communities seem today inadequate or unsuitable because they
are linked with social and cultural patterns of the past. On the other
hand, in many places people are seeking new ways of expressing the
unchangeable relationship of creatures with their Creator, of children
with their Father. In some people this may cause temporary confusion. But
anyone who with trust in God reflects upon these phenomena discovers that
many tendencies of modern piety (for example, the interiorization of
religious sentiment) are meant to play their part in the development of
Christian piety in general and devotion to the Blessed Virgin in
particular. Thus our own time, faithfully attentive to tradition and to
the progress of theology and the sciences, will make its contribution of
praise to her whom, according to her own prophetical words, all
generations will call blessed (cf. Lk. 1:48).

<p>We therefore judge it in keeping with our apostolic service, venerable
Brothers, to deal, in a sort of dialogue, with a number of themes
connected with the place that the Blessed Virgin occupies in the Church's
worship. These themes have already been partly touched upon by the Second
Vatican Council[7] and also by ourself,[8] but it is useful to return to
them in order to remove doubts and, especially, to help the development
of that devotion to the Blessed Virgin which in the Church is motivated
by the Word of God and practiced in the Spirit of Christ.

<p>We therefore wish to dwell upon a number of questions concerning the
relationship between the sacred liturgy and devotion to the Blessed
Virgin (I), to offer considerations and directives suitable for favoring
the development of that devotion (II) and finally to put forward a number
of reflections intended to encourage the restoration, in a dynamic and
more informed manner, of the recitation of the Rosary, the practice of
which was so strongly recommended by our predecessors and is so widely
diffused among the Christian people (III).

<p>1. As we prepare to discuss the place which the Blessed Virgin Mary
occupies in Christian worship, we must first turn our attention to the
sacred liturgy. In addition to its rich doctrinal content, the liturgy
has an incomparable pastoral effectiveness and a recognized exemplary
value for the other forms of worship. We would have liked to take into
consideration the various liturgies of the East and the West, but for the
purpose of this document we shall dwell almost exclusively on the books
of the Roman Rite. In fact, in accordance with the practical norms issued
by the Second Vatican Council,[9] it is this Rite alone which has been
the object of profound renewal. This is true also in regard to
expressions of veneration for Mary. This Rite therefore deserves to be
carefully considered and evaluated.

<p>2. The reform of the Roman liturgy presupposed a careful restoration of
its General Calendar. This Calendar is arranged in such a way as to give
fitting prominence to the celebration on appropriate days of the work of
salvation. It distributes throughout the year the whole mystery of
Christ, from the Incarnation to the expectation of His return in
glory,[10] and thus makes it possible in a more organic and closely-knit
fashion to include the commemoration of Christ's Mother in the annual
cycle of the mysteries of her Son.

<p>3. For example, during Advent there are many liturgical references to
Mary besides the Solemnity of December 8, which is a joint celebration of
the Immaculate Conception of Mary, of the basic preparation (cf. Is.
11:1, 10) for the coming of the Savior and of the happy beginning of the
Church without spot or wrinkle.[11] Such liturgical references are found
especially on the days from December 17 to 24, and more particularly on
the Sunday before Christmas, which recalls the ancient prophecies
concerning the Virgin Mother and the Messiah[12] and includes readings
from the Gospel concerning the imminent birth of Christ and His
precursor.[13]

<p>4. In this way the faithful, living in the liturgy the spirit of Advent,
by thinking about the inexpressible love with which the Virgin Mother
awaited her Son,[14] are invited to take her as a model and to prepare
themselves to meet the Savior who is to come. They must be "vigilant in
prayer and joyful in. . .praise."[15] We would also remark that the Advent
liturgy, by linking the awaiting of the Messiah and the awaiting of the
glorious return of Christ with the admirable commemoration of His Mother,
presents a happy balance in worship. This balance can be taken as a norm
for preventing any tendency (as has happened at times in certain forms of
popular piety) to separate devotion to the Blessed Virgin from its
necessary point of reference--Christ. It also ensures that this season,
as liturgy experts have noted, should be considered as a time
particularly suited to devotion to the Mother of the Lord. This is an
orientation that we confirm and which we hope to see accepted and
followed everywhere.

<p>5. The Christmas season is a prolonged commemoration of the divine,
virginal and salvific motherhood of her whose "inviolate virginity
brought the Savior into the world."[16] In fact, on the Solemnity of the
Birth of Christ the Church both adores the Savior and venerates His
glorious Mother. On the Epiphany, when she celebrates the universal call
to salvation, the Church contemplates the Blessed Virgin, the true Seat
of Wisdom and true Mother of the King, who presents to the Wise Men, for
their adoration, the Redeemer of all peoples (cf. Mt. 2:11). On the Feast
of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph (the Sunday within the
octave of Christmas) the Church meditates with profound reverence upon
the holy life led in the house at Nazareth by Jesus, the Son of God and
Son of Man, Mary His Mother, and Joseph the just man (cf. Mt. 1:19).

<p>In the revised ordering of the Christmas period it seems to us that the
attention of all should be directed towards the restored Solemnity of
Mary the holy Mother of God. This celebration, placed on January 1 in
conformity with the ancient indication of the liturgy of the City of
Rome, is meant to commemorate the part played by Mary in this mystery of
salvation. It is meant also to exalt the singular dignity which this
mystery brings to the "holy Mother. . .through whom we were found worthy to
receive the Author of life."[17] It is likewise a fitting occasion for
renewing adoration of the newborn Prince of Peace, for listening once
more to the glad tidings of the angels (cf. Lk. 2:14), and for imploring
from God, through the Queen of Peace, the supreme gift of peace. It is
for this reason that, in the happy concurrence of the Octave of Christmas
and the first day of the year, we have instituted the World Day of Peace,
an occasion that is gaining increasing support and already bringing forth
fruits of peace in the hearts of many.

<p>6. To the two solemnities already mentioned (the Immaculate Conception
and the Divine Motherhood) should be added the ancient and venerable
celebrations of March 25 and August 15.

<p>For the Solemnity of the Incarnation of the Word, in the Roman Calendar
the ancient title--the Annunciation of the Lord--has been deliberately
restored, but the feast was and is a joint one of Christ and of the
Blessed Virgin: of the Word, who becomes "Son of Mary" (Mk. 6:3), and of
the Virgin, who becomes Mother of God. With regard to Christ, the East
and the West, in the inexhaustible riches of their liturgies, celebrate
this solemnity as the commemoration of the salvific "fiat" of the
Incarnate Word, who, entering the world, said: "God, here I am! I am
coming to obey Your will" (cf. Heb. 10:7; Ps. 39:8-9). They commemorate
it as the beginning of the redemption and of the indissoluble and wedded
union of the divine nature with human nature in the one Person of the
Word. With regard to Mary, these liturgies celebrate it as a feast of the
new Eve, the obedient and faithful virgin, who with her generous "fiat"
(cf. Lk. 1:38) became through the working of the Spirit the Mother of
God, but also the true Mother of the living, and, by receiving into her
womb the one Mediator (cf: 1 Tm. 2:5), became the true Ark of the
Covenant and true Temple of God. These liturgies celebrate it as a
culminating moment in the salvific dialogue between God and man, and as a
commemoration of the Blessed Virgin's free consent and cooperation in the
plan of redemption.

<p>The solemnity of August 15 celebrates the glorious Assumption of Mary
into heaven. It is a feast of her destiny of fullness and blessedness, of
the glorification of her immaculate soul and of her virginal body, of her
perfect configuration to the Risen Christ, a feast that sets before the
eyes of the Church and of all mankind the image and the consoling proof
of the fulfillment of their final hope, namely, that this full
glorification is the destiny of all those whom Christ has made His
brothers, having "flesh and blood in common with them" (Heb. 2:14; cf.
Gal. 4:4). The Solemnity of the Assumption is prolonged in the
celebration of the Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which occurs
seven days later. On this occasion we contemplate her who, seated beside
the King of ages, shines forth as Queen and intercedes as Mother.[18]

<p>These four solemnities, therefore, mark with the highest liturgical rank
the main dogmatic truths concerning the handmaid of the Lord.

<p>7. After the solemnities just mentioned, particular consideration must be
given to those celebrations that commemorate salvific events in which the
Blessed Virgin was closely associated with her Son. Such are the feasts
of the Nativity of Our Lady (September 8), "the hope of the entire world
and the dawn of salvation"[19]; and the Visitation (May 31), in which the
liturgy recalls the "Blessed Virgin Mary carrying her Son within
her,"[20] and visiting Elizabeth to offer charitable assistance and to
proclaim the mercy of God the Savior.[21] Then there is the commemoration
of Our Lady of Sorrows (September 15), a fitting occasion for reliving a
decisive moment in the history of salvation and for venerating, together
with the Son "lifted up on the cross, His suffering Mother."[22]

<p>The feast of February 2, which has been given back its ancient name, the
Presentation of the Lord, should also be considered as a joint
commemoration of the Son and of the Mother, if we are fully to appreciate
its rich content. It is the celebration of a mystery of salvation
accomplished by Christ, a mystery with which the Blessed Virgin was
intimately associated as the Mother of the Suffering Servant of Yahweh,
as the one who performs a mission belonging to ancient Israel, and as the
model for the new People of God, which is ever being tested in its faith
and hope by suffering and persecution (cf. Lk. 2:21-35).

<p>8. The restored Roman Calendar gives particular prominence to the
celebrations listed above, but it also includes other kinds of
commemorations connected with local devotions and which have acquired a
wider popularity and interest (e.g., February 11, Our Lady of Lourdes;
August 5, the Dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major). Then there
are others, originally celebrated by particular religious families but
which today, by reason of the popularity they have gained, can truly be
considered ecclesial (e.g., July 16, Our Lady of Mount Carmel; October 7,
Our Lady of the Rosary). There are still others which, apart from their
apocryphal content, present lofty and exemplary values and carry on
venerable traditions having their origin especially in the East (e.g.,
the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin, celebrated on the Saturday
following the second Sunday after Pentecost).9. Nor must one forget that
the General Roman Calendar does not include all celebrations in honor of
the Blessed Virgin. Rather, it is for individual Calendars to include,
with fidelity to liturgical norms but with sincere endorsement, the
Marian feasts proper to the different local Churches. Lastly, it should
be noted that frequent commemorations of the Blessed Virgin are possible
through the use of the Saturday Masses of our Lady. This is an ancient
and simple commemoration and one that is made very adaptable and varied
by the flexibility of the modern Calendar and the number of formulas
provided by the Missal.

<p>10. In this Apostolic Exhortation we do not intend to examine the whole
content of the new Roman Missal. But by reason of the work of evaluation
that we have undertaken to carry out in regard to the revised books of
the Roman Rite,[23] we would like to mention some of the aspects and
themes of the Missal. In the first place, we are pleased to note how the
Eucharistic Prayers of the Missal, in admirable harmony with the Eastern
liturgies,[24] contain a significant commemoration of the Blessed Virgin.
For example, the ancient Roman Canon, which commemorates the Mother of
the Lord in terms full of doctrine and devotional inspiration: "In union
with the whole Church we honor Mary, the ever-virgin Mother of Jesus
Christ our Lord and God." In a similar way the recent Eucharistic Prayer
III expresses with intense supplication the desire of those praying to
share with the Mother the inheritance of sons: "May he make us an
everlasting gift to you [the Father] and enable us to share in the
inheritance of your saints, with Mary, the Virgin Mother of God." This
daily commemoration, by reason of its place at the heart of the divine
Sacrifice, should be considered a particularly expressive form of the
veneration that the Church pays to the "Blessed of the Most High" (cf.
Lk. 1:28).

<p>11. As we examine the texts of the revised Missal we see how the great
Marian themes of the Roman prayerbook have been accepted in perfect
doctrinal continuity with the past. Thus, for example, we have the themes
of Mary's Immaculate Conception and fullness of grace, the divine
motherhood, the unblemished and fruitful virginity, the Temple of the
Holy Spirit, Mary's cooperation in the work of her Son, her exemplary
sanctity, merciful intercession, Assumption into heaven, maternal
Queenship and many other themes. We also see how other themes, in a
certain sense new ones, have been introduced in equally perfect harmony
with the theological developments of the present day. Thus, for example,
we have the theme of Mary and the Church, which has been inserted into
the texts of the Missal in a variety of aspects, a variety that matches
the many and varied relations that exist between the Mother of Christ and
the Church. For example, in the celebration of the Immaculate Conception
which texts recognize the beginning of the Church, the spotless Bride of
Christ.[25] In the Assumption they recognize the beginning that has
already been made and the image of what, for the whole Church, must still
come to pass.[26] In the mystery of Mary's motherhood they confess that
she is the Mother of the Head and of the members--the holy Mother of God
and therefore the provident Mother of the Church.[27]

<p>When the liturgy turns its gaze either to the primitive Church or to the
Church of our own days it always finds Mary. In the primitive Church she
is seen praying with the apostles[28]; in our own day she is actively
present, and the Church desires to live the mystery of Christ with her:
"Grant that your Church which with Mary shared Christ's passion may be
worthy to share also in his resurrection."[29] She is also seen
represented as a voice of praise in unison with which the Church wishes
to give glory to God: ". . .with her [Mary] may we always praise you."[30]
 And since the liturgy is worship that requires a way of living
consistent with it, it asks that devotion to the Blessed Virgin should
become a concrete and deeply-felt love for the Church, as is wonderfully
expressed in the prayer after Communion in the Mass of September 15:
". . .that as we recall the sufferings shared by the Blessed Virgin Mary,
we may with the Church fulfill in ourselves what is lacking in the
sufferings of Christ."

<p>12. The Lectionary is one of the books of the Roman Rite that has greatly
benefited from the post-conciliar reform, by reason both of its added
texts and of the intrinsic value of these texts, which contain the
ever-living and efficacious word of God (cf. Heb. 4:12). This rich
collection of biblical texts has made it possible to arrange the whole
history of salvation in an orderly three-year cycle and to set forth more
completely the mystery of Christ. The logical consequence has been that
the Lectionary contains a larger number of Old and New Testament readings
concerning the Blessed Virgin. This numerical increase has not however
been based on random choice: only those readings have been accepted which
in different ways and degrees can be considered Marian, either from the
evidence of their content or from the results of careful exegesis,
supported by the teachings of the magisterium or by solid Tradition. It
is also right to observe that these readings occur not only on feasts of
the Blessed Virgin but are read on many other occasions, for example on
certain Sundays during the liturgical year,[31] in the celebration of
rites that deeply concern the Christian's sacramental life and the
choices confronting him,[32] as also in the joyful or sad experiences of
his life on earth.[33]

<p>13. The Liturgy of the Hours, the revised book of the Office, also
contains outstanding examples of devotion to the Mother of the Lord.
These are to be found in the hymns--which include several masterpieces of
universal literature, such as Dante's sublime prayer to the Blessed
Virgin[34]--and in the antiphons that complete the daily Office. To these
Iyrical invocations there has been added the well-known prayer Sub tuum
praesidium, venerable for its antiquity and admirable for its content.
Other examples occur in the prayers of intercession at Lauds and Vespers,
prayers which frequently express trusting recourse to the Mother of
mercy. Finally there are selections from the vast treasury of writings on
our Lady composed by authors of the first Christian centuries, of the
Middle Ages and of modern times.

<p>14. The commemoration of the Blessed Virgin occurs often in the Missal,
the Lectionary and the Liturgy of the Hours--the hinges of the liturgical
prayer of the Roman Rite. In the other revised liturgical books also
expressions of love and suppliant veneration addressed to the Theotokos
are not lacking. Thus the Church invokes her, the Mother of grace, before
immersing candidates in the saving waters of baptism[35]; the Church
invokes her intercession for mothers who, full of gratitude for the gift
of motherhood, come to church to express their joy[36]; the Church holds
her up as a model to those who follow Christ by embracing the religious
life[37] or who receive the Consecration of Virgins.[38] For these people
the Church asks Mary's motherly assistance.[39] The Church prays
fervently to Mary on behalf of her children who have come to the hour of
their death.[40] The Church asks Mary's intercession for those who have
closed their eyes to the light of this world and appeared before Christ,
the eternal Light[41]; and the Church, through Mary's prayers, invokes
comfort upon those who in sorrow mourn with faith the departure of their
loved ones.[42]

<p>15. The examination of the revised liturgical books leads us to the
comforting observation that the postconciliar renewal has, as was
previously desired by the liturgical movement, properly considered the
Blessed Virgin in the mystery of Christ, and, in harmony with tradition,
has recognized the singular place that belongs to her in Christian
worship as the holy Mother of God and the worthy Associate of the
Redeemer.

<p>It could not have been otherwise. If one studies the history of Christian
worship, in fact, one notes that both in the East and in the West the
highest and purest expressions of devotion to the Blessed Virgin have
sprung from the liturgy or have been incorporated into it.

<p>We wish to emphasize the fact that the veneration which the universal
Church today accords to blessed Mary is a derivation from and an
extension and unceasing increase of the devotion that the Church of every
age has paid to her, with careful attention to truth and with an ever
watchful nobility of expression. From perennial Tradition kept alive by
reason of the uninterrupted presence of the Spirit and continual
attention to the Word, the Church of our time draws motives, arguments
and incentives for the veneration that she pays to the Blessed Virgin.
And the liturgy, which receives approval and strength from the
magisterium, is a most lofty expression and an evident proof of this
living Tradition.

<p>16. In accordance with some of the guidelines of the Council's teaching
on Mary and the Church, we now wish to examine more closely a particular
aspect of the relationship between Mary and the liturgy--namely, Mary as
a model of the spiritual attitude with which the Church celebrates and
lives the divine mysteries. That the Blessed Virgin is an exemplar in
this field derives from the fact that she is recognized as a most
excellent exemplar of the. Church in the order of faith, charity and
perfect union with Christ,[43] that is, of that interior disposition with
which the Church, the beloved spouse, closely associated with her Lord,
invokes Christ and through Him worships the eternal Father.[44]

<p>17. Mary is the attentive Virgin, who receives the word of God with
faith, that faith which in her case was the gateway and path to divine
motherhood, for, as Saint Augustine realized, "Blessed Mary by believing
conceived Him [Jesus] whom believing she brought forth."[45] In fact,
when she received from the angel the answer to her doubt (cf. Lk.
1:34-37), "full of faith, and conceiving Christ in her mind before
conceiving Him in her womb, she said, 'I am the handmaid of the Lord, let
what you have said be done to me' (Lk. 1:38)."[46] It was faith that was
for her the cause of blessedness and certainty in the fulfillment of the
promise: "Blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the
Lord would be fulfilled" (Lk. 1:45). Similarly, it was faith with which
she, who played a part in the Incarnation and was a unique witness to it,
thinking back on the events of the infancy of Christ, meditated upon
these events in her heart (cf. Lk. 2:19, 51). The Church also acts in
this way, especially in the liturgy, when with faith she listens,
accepts, proclaims and venerates the word of God, distributes it to the
faithful as the bread of life[47] and in the light of that word examines
the signs of the times and interprets and lives the events of history.

<p>18. Mary is also the Virgin in prayer. She appears as such in the visit
to the mother of the precursor, when she pours out her soul in
expressions glorifying God, and expressions of humility, faith and hope.
This prayer is the Magnificat (cf. Lk. 1:46-55), Mary's prayer par
excellence, the song of the messianic times in which there mingles the
joy of the ancient and the new Israel. As St. Irenaeus seems to suggest,
it is in Mary's canticle that there was heard once more the rejoicing of
Abraham who foresaw the Messiah (cf. Jn. 8:56)[48] and there rang out in
prophetic anticipation the voice of the Church: "In her exultation Mary
prophetically declared in the name of the Church: 'My soul proclaims the
glory of the Lord. . . .'"[49] And in fact Mary's hymn has spread far and
wide and has become the prayer of the whole Church in all ages.

<p>At Cana, Mary appears once more as the Virgin in prayer: when she
tactfully told her Son of a temporal need, she also obtained an effect of
grace, namely, that Jesus, in working the first of His "signs," confirmed
His disciples' faith in Him (cf. Jn. 2:1-12).

<p>Likewise, the last description of Mary's life presents her as praying.
The apostles "joined in continuous prayer, together with several women,
including Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers" (Acts 1:14).
We have here the prayerful presence of Mary in the early Church and in
the Church throughout all ages, for, having been assumed into heaven, she
has not abandoned her mission of intercession and salvation.[50] The
title Virgin in prayer also fits the Church, which day by day presents to
the Father the needs of her children, "praises the Lord unceasingly and
intercedes for the salvation of the world."[51]

<p>19. Mary is also the Virgin-Mother--she who "believing and
obeying. . .brought forth on earth the Father's Son. This she did, not
knowing man but overshadowed by the Holy Spirit."[52] This was a
miraculous motherhood, set up by God as the type and exemplar of the
fruitfulness of the Virgin-Church, which "becomes herself a mother. . . .
For by her preaching and by baptism she brings forth to a new and
immortal life children who are conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
and born of God."[53] The ancient Fathers rightly taught that the Church
prolongs in the sacrament of Baptism the virginal motherhood of Mary.
Among such references we like to recall that of our illustrious
predecessor, Saint Leo the Great, who in a Christmas homily says: "The
origin which [Christ] took in the womb of the Virgin He has given to the
baptismal font: He has given to water what He had given to His
Mother--the power of the Most High and the overshadowing of the Holy
Spirit (cf. Lk. 1:35), which was responsible for Mary's bringing forth
the Savior, has the same effect, so that water may regenerate the
believer."[54] If we wished to go to liturgical sources, we could quote
the beautiful Illatio of the Mozarabic liturgy: "The former [Mary]
carried Life in her womb; the latter [the Church] bears Life in the
waters of baptism. In Mary's members Christ was formed; in the waters of
the Church Christ is put on."[55]

<p>20. Mary is, finally, the Virgin presenting offerings. In the episode of
the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (cf. Lk. 2:22-35), the Church,
guided by the Spirit, has detected, over and above the fulfillment of the
laws regarding the offering of the firstborn (cf. Ex. 13:11-16) and the
purification of the mother (cf. Lv. 12:6-8), a mystery of salvation
related to the history of salvation. That is, she has noted the
continuity of the fundamental offering that the Incarnate Word made to
the Father when He entered the world (cf. Heb. 15:5-7). The Church has
seen the universal nature of salvation proclaimed, for Simeon, greeting
in the Child the light to enlighten the peoples and the glory of the
people Israel (cf. Lk. 2:32), recognized in Him the Messiah, the Savior
of all. The Church has understood the prophetic reference to the Passion
of Christ: the fact that Simeon's words, which linked in one prophecy the
Son as "the sign of contradiction" (Lk. 2:34) and the Mother, whose soul
would be pierced by a sword (cf. Lk. 2:35), came true on Calvary. A
mystery of salvation, therefore, that in its various aspects orients the
episode of the Presentation in the Temple to the salvific event of the
cross. But the Church herself, in particular from the Middle Ages
onwards, has detected in the heart of the Virgin taking her Son to
Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord (cf. Lk. 2:22) a desire to make an
offering, a desire that exceeds the ordinary meaning of the rite. A
witness to this intuition is found in the loving prayer of Saint Bernard:
"Offer your Son, holy Virgin, and present to the Lord the blessed fruit
of your womb. Offer for the reconciliation of us all the holy Victim
which is pleasing to God."[56]

<p>This union of the Mother and the Son in the work of redemption[57]
reaches its climax on Calvary, where Christ "offered himself as the
perfect sacrifice to God" (Heb. 9:14) and where Mary stood by the cross
(cf. Jn. 19:25), "suffering grievously with her only-begotten Son. There
she united herself with a maternal heart to His sacrifice, and lovingly
consented to the immolation of this victim which she herself had brought
forth"[58] and also was offering to the eternal Father.[59] To perpetuate
down the centuries the Sacrifice of the Cross, the divine Savior
instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice, the memorial of His death and
resurrection, and entrusted it to His spouse the Church,[60] which,
especially on Sundays, calls the faithful together to celebrate the
Passover of the Lord until He comes again.[61] This the Church does in
union with the saints in heaven and in particular with the Blessed
Virgin,[62] whose burning charity and unshakeable faith she imitates.

<p>21. Mary is not only an example for the whole Church in the exercise of
divine worship but is also, clearly, a teacher of the spiritual life for
individual Christians. The faithful at a very early date began to look to
Mary and to imitate her in making their lives an act of worship of God
and making their worship a commitment of their lives. As early as the
fourth century, St. Ambrose, speaking to the people, expressed the hope
that each of them would have the spirit of Mary in order to glorify God:
"May the heart of Mary be in each Christian to proclaim the greatness of
the Lord; may her spirit be in everyone to exult in God."[63] But Mary is
above all the example of that worship that consists in making one's life
an offering to God. This is an ancient and ever new doctrine that each
individual can hear again by heeding the Church's teaching, but also by
heeding the very voice of the Virgin as she, anticipating in herself the
wonderful petition of the Lord's Prayer--"Your will be done" (Mt.
6:10)--replied to God's messenger: "I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let
what you have said be done to me" (Lk. 1:38). And Mary's "yes" is for all
Christians a lesson and example of obedience to the will of the Father,
which is the way and means of one's own sanctification.

<p>22. It is also important to note how the Church expresses in various
effective attitudes of devotion the many relationships that bind her to
Mary: in profound veneration, when she reflects on the singular dignity
of the Virgin who, through the action of the Holy Spirit, has become
Mother of the Incarnate Word, in burning love, when she considers the
spiritual motherhood of Mary towards all members of the Mystical Body; in
trusting invocation, when she experiences the intercession of her
advocate and helper[64]; in loving service, when she sees in the humble
handmaid of the Lord the queen of mercy and the mother of grace; in
zealous imitation, when she contemplates the holiness and virtues of her
who is "full of grace" (Lk. 1:28); in profound wonder, when she sees in
her, "as in a faultless model, that which she herself wholly desires and
hopes to be"[65]; in attentive study, when she recognizes in the
associate of the Redeemer, who already shares fully in the fruits of the
Paschal Mystery, the prophetic fulfillment of her own future, until the
day on which, when she has been purified of every spot and wrinkle (cf.
Eph. 5:27), she will become like a bride arrayed for the bridegroom,
Jesus Christ (cf. Rev. 21:2).

<p>23. Therefore, venerable Brothers, as we consider the piety that the
liturgical Tradition of the universal Church and the renewed Roman Rite
expresses towards the holy Mother of God, and as we remember that the
liturgy through its pre-eminent value as worship constitutes the golden
norm for Christian piety, and finally as we observe how the Church when
she celebrates the sacred mysteries assumes an attitude of faith and love
similar to that of the Virgin, we realize the rightness of the
exhortation that the Second Vatican Council addresses to all the children
of the Church, namely "that the cult, especially the liturgical cult, of
the Blessed Virgin be generously fostered."[66] This is an exhortation
that we would like to see accepted everywhere without reservation and put
into zealous practice.

<p>24. The Second Vatican Council also exhorts us to promote other forms of
piety side by side with liturgical worship, especially those recommended
by the magisterium.[67] However, as is well known, the piety of the
faithful and their veneration of the Mother of God has taken on many
forms according to circumstances of time and place the different
sensibilities of peoples and their different cultural traditions. Hence
it is that the forms in which this devotion is expressed, being subject
to the ravages of time, show the need for a renewal that will permit them
to substitute elements that are transient, to emphasize the elements that
are ever new and to incorporate the doctrinal data obtained from
theological reflection and the proposals of the Church's magisterium.
This shows the need for episcopal conferences, local churches, religious
families and communities of the faithful to promote a genuine creative
activity and at the same time to proceed to a careful revision of
expressions and exercises of piety directed towards the Blessed Virgin.
We would like this revision to be respectful of wholesome tradition and
open to the legitimate requests of the people of our time. It seems
fitting therefore, venerable Brothers, to put forward some principles for
action in this field.

<p>25. In the first place it is supremely fitting that exercises of piety
directed towards the Virgin Mary should clearly express the Trinitarian
and Christological note that is intrinsic and essential to them.
Christian worship in fact is of itself worship offered to the Father and
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, or, as the liturgy puts it, to the
Father through Christ in the Spirit. From this point of view worship is
rightly extended, though in a substantially different way, first and
foremost and in a special manner, to the Mother of the Lord and then to
the saints, in whom the Church proclaims the Paschal Mystery, for they
have suffered with Christ and have been glorified with Him.[68] In the
Virgin Mary everything is relative to Christ and dependent upon Him. It
was with a view to Christ that God the Father from all eternity chose her
to be the all-holy Mother and adorned her with gifts of the Spirit
granted to no one else. Certainly genuine Christian piety has never
failed to highlight the indissoluble link and essential relationship of
the Virgin to the divine Savior.69. Yet it seems to us particularly in
conformity with the spiritual orientation of our time, which is dominated
and absorbed by the "question of Christ,"[70] that in the expressions of
devotion to the Virgin the Christological aspect should have particular
prominence. It likewise seems to us fitting that these expressions of
devotion should reflect God's plan, which laid down "with one single
decree the origin of Mary and the Incarnation of the divine Wisdom."[71]
 This will without doubt contribute to making piety towards the Mother of
Jesus more solid, and to making it an effective instrument for attaining
to full "knowledge of the Son of God, until we become the perfect man,
fully mature with the fullness of Christ himself" (Eph. 4:13). It will
also contribute to increasing the worship due to Christ Himself, since,
according to the perennial mind of the Church authoritatively repeated in
our own day,[72] "what is given to the handmaid is referred to the Lord;
thus what is given to the Mother redounds to the Son; . . .and thus what is
given as humble tribute to the Queen becomes honor rendered to the
King."[73]

<p>26. It seems to us useful to add to this mention of the Christological
orientation of devotion to the Blessed Virgin a reminder of the
fittingness of giving prominence in this devotion to one of the essential
facts of the Faith: the Person and work of the Holy Spirit. Theological
reflection and the liturgy have in fact noted how the sanctifying
intervention of the Spirit in the Virgin of Nazareth was a culminating
moment of the Spirit's action in the history of salvation. Thus, for
example, some Fathers and writers of the Church attributed to the work of
the Spirit the original holiness of Mary, who was as it were "fashioned
by the Holy Spirit into a kind of new substance and new creature."[74]
 Reflecting on the Gospel texts--"The Holy Spirit will come upon you and
the power of the Most High will cover you with his shadow" (Lk. 1:35) and
"[Mary] was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. . . . She has
conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit" (Mt. 1:18, 20)--they saw in
the Spirit's intervention an action that consecrated and made fruitful
Mary's virginity[75] and transformed her into the "Abode of the King" or
"Bridal Chamber of the Word,"[76] the "Temple" or "Tabernacle of the
Lord,"[77] the "Ark of the Covenant" or "the Ark of Holiness,"[78] titles
rich in biblical echoes. Examining more deeply still the mystery of the
Incarnation, they saw in the mysterious relationship between the Spirit
and Mary an aspect redolent of marriage, poetically portrayed by
Prudentius: "The unwed Virgin espoused the Spirit,"[79] and they called
her the "Temple of the Holy Spirit,"[80] an expression that emphasizes
the sacred character of the Virgin, now the permanent dwelling of the
Spirit of God. Delving deeply into the doctrine of the Paraclete, they
saw that from Him as from a spring there flowed forth the fullness of
grace (cf. Lk. 1:28) and the abundance of gifts that adorned her. Thus
they attributed to the Spirit the faith, hope and charity that animated
the Virgin's heart, the strength that sustained her acceptance of the
will of God, and the vigor that upheld her in her suffering at the foot
of the cross.[81] In Mary's prophetic canticle (cf. Lk. 1:46-55) they saw
a special working of the Spirit who had spoken through the mouths of the
prophets.[82] Considering, finally, the presence of the Mother of Jesus
in the Upper Room, where the Spirit came down upon the infant Church (cf.
Acts 1:12-14; 2:1-4), they enriched with new developments the ancient
theme of Mary and the Church.[83] Above all they had recourse to the
Virgin's intercession in order to obtain from the Spirit the capacity for
engendering Christ in their own soul, as is attested to by Saint
Ildephonsus in a prayer of supplication, amazing in its doctrine and
prayerful power: "I beg you, holy Virgin, that I may have Jesus from the
Holy Spirit, by whom you brought Jesus forth. May my soul receive Jesus
through the Holy Spirit by whom your flesh conceived Jesus. . . . May I love
Jesus in the Holy Spirit in whom you adore Jesus as Lord and gaze upon
Him as your Son."[84]

<p>27. It is sometimes said that many spiritual writings today do not
sufficiently reflect the whole doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit. It is
the task of specialists to verify and weigh the truth of this assertion,
but it is our task to exhort everyone, especially those in the pastoral
ministry and also theologians, to meditate more deeply on the working of
the Holy Spirit in the history of salvation, and to ensure that Christian
spiritual writings give due prominence to His life-giving action. Such a
study will bring out in particular the hidden relationship between the
Spirit of God and the Virgin of Nazareth, and show the influence they
exert on the Church. From a more profound meditation on the truths of the
Faith will flow a more vital piety.

<p>28. It is also necessary that exercises of piety with which the faithful
honor the Mother of the Lord should clearly show the place she occupies
in the Church: "the highest place and the closest to us after
Christ."[85] The liturgical buildings of Byzantine rite, both in the
architectural structure itself and in the use of images, show clearly
Mary's place in the Church. On the central door of the iconostasis there
is a representation of the Annunciation and in the apse an image of the
glorious Theotokos. In this way one perceives how through the assent of
the humble handmaid of the Lord mankind begins its return to God and sees
in the glory of the all-holy Virgin the goal towards which it is
journeying. The symbolism by which a church building demonstrates Mary's
place in the mystery of the Church is full of significance and gives
grounds for hoping that the different forms of devotion to the Blessed
Virgin may everywhere be open to ecclesial perspectives.

<p>The faithful will be able to appreciate more easily Mary's mission in the
mystery of the Church and her preeminent place in the communion of saints
if attention is drawn to the Second Vatican Council's references to the
fundamental concepts of the nature of the Church as the Family of God,
the People of God, the Kingdom of God and the Mystical Body of
Christ.[86] This will also bring the faithful to a deeper realization of
the brotherhood which unites all of them as sons and daughters of the
Virgin Mary, "who with a mother's love has cooperated in their rebirth
and spiritual formation,"[87] and as sons and daughters of the Church,
since "we are born from the Church's womb we are nurtured by the Church's
milk, we are given life by the Church's Spirit."[88] They will also
realize that both the Church and Mary collaborate to give birth to the
Mystical Body of Christ since "both of them are the Mother of Christ, but
neither brings forth the whole [body] independently of the other."[89]

<p>Similarly the faithful will appreciate more clearly that the action of
the Church in the world can be likened to an extension of Mary's concern.
The active love she showed at Nazareth, in the house of Elizabeth, at
Cana and on Golgotha--all salvific episodes having vast ecclesial
importance--finds its extension in the Church's maternal concern that all
men should come to knowledge of the truth (cf. 1 Tm. 2:4), in the
Church's concern for people in lowly circumstances and for the poor and
weak, and in her constant commitment to peace and social harmony, as well
as in her untiring efforts to ensure that all men will share in the
salvation which was merited for them by Christ's death. Thus love for the
Church will become love for Mary, and vice versa, since the one cannot
exist without the other, as St. Chromatius of Aquileia observed with keen
discernment: "The Church was united. . . in the Upper Room with Mary the
Mother of Jesus and with His brethren. The Church therefore cannot be
referred to as such unless it includes Mary the Mother of our Lord,
together with His brethren."[90] In conclusion, therefore, we repeat that
devotion to the Blessed Virgin must explicitly show its intrinsic and
ecclesiological content: thus it will be enabled to revise its forms and
texts in a fitting way.

<p>29. The above considerations spring from an examination of the Virgin
Mary's relationship with God--the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit--and with the Church. Following the path traced by conciliar
teaching,[91] we wish to add some further guidelines from Scripture,
liturgy, ecumenism and anthropology. These are to be borne in mind in any
revision of exercises of piety or in the creation of new ones, in order
to emphasize and accentuate the bond which unites us to her who is the
Mother of Christ and our Mother in the communion of saints.

<p>30. Today it is recognized as a general need of Christian piety that
every form of worship should have a biblical imprint. The progress made
in biblical studies, the increasing dissemination of the Sacred
Scriptures, and above all the example of Tradition and the interior
action of the Holy Spirit are tending to cause the modern Christian to
use the Bible ever increasingly as the basic prayerbook, and to draw from
it genuine inspiration and unsurpassable examples. Devotion to the
Blessed Virgin cannot be exempt from this general orientation of
Christian piety[92]; indeed it should draw inspiration in a special way
from this orientation in order to gain new vigor and sure help. In its
wonderful presentation of God's plan for man's salvation, the Bible is
replete with the mystery of the Savior, and from Genesis to the Book of
Revelation, also contains clear references to her who was the Mother and
associate of the Savior. We would not, however, wish this biblical
imprint to be merely a diligent use of texts and symbols skillfully
selected from the Sacred Scriptures. More than this is necessary. What is
needed is that texts of prayers and chants should draw their inspiration
and their wording from the Bible, and above all that devotion to the
Virgin should be imbued with the great themes of the Christian message.
This will ensure that, as they venerate the Seat of Wisdom, the faithful
in their turn will be enlightened by the divine word, and be inspired to
live their lives in accordance with the precepts of Incarnate Wisdom.

<p>31. We have already spoken of the veneration which the Church gives to
the Mother of God in the celebration of the sacred liturgy. However,
speaking of the other forms of devotion and of the criteria on which they
should be based we wish to recall the norm laid down in the Constitution
Sacrosanctum concilium. This document, while wholeheartedly approving of
the practices of piety of the Christian people, goes on to say: ". . .it is
necessary however that such devotions with consideration for the
liturgical seasons should be so arranged as to be in harmony with the
sacred liturgy. They should somehow derive their inspiration from it, and
because of its pre-eminence they should orient the Christian people
towards it."[93] Although this is a wise and clear rule, its application
is not an easy matter, especially in regard to Marian devotions, which
are so varied in their formal expressions. What is needed on the part of
the leaders of the local communities is effort, pastoral sensitivity and
perseverance, while the faithful on their part must show a willingness to
accept guidelines and ideas drawn from the true nature of Christian
worship; this sometimes makes it necessary to change long-standing
customs wherein the real nature of this Christian worship has become
somewhat obscured.

<p>In this context we wish to mention two attitudes which in pastoral
practice could nullify the norm of the Second Vatican Council. In the
first place there are certain persons concerned with the care of souls
who scorn, a priori, devotions of piety which, in their correct forms,
have been recommended by the magisterium, who leave them aside and in
this way create a vacuum which they do not fill. They forget that the
Council has said that devotions of piety should harmonize with the
liturgy, not be suppressed. Secondly there are those who, without
wholesome liturgical and pastoral criteria, mix practices of piety and
liturgical acts in hybrid celebrations. It sometimes happens that novenas
or similar practices of piety are inserted into the very celebration of
the Eucharistic Sacrifice. This creates the danger that the Lord's
Memorial Rite, instead of being the culmination of the meeting of the
Christian community, becomes the occasion, as it were, for devotional
practices. For those who act in this way we wish to recall the rule laid
down by the Council prescribing that exercises of piety should be
harmonized with the liturgy, not merged into it. Wise pastoral action
should, on the one hand, point out and emphasize the proper nature of the
liturgical acts, while on the other hand it should enhance the value of
practices of piety in order to adapt them to the needs of individual
communities in the Church and to make them valuable aids to the liturgy.

<p>32. Because of its ecclesial character, devotion to the Blessed Virgin
reflects the preoccupations of the Church herself. Among these especially
in our day is her anxiety for the re-establishment of Christian unity. In
this way devotion to the Mother of the Lord is in accord with the deep
desires and aims of the ecumenical movement, that is, it acquires an
ecumenical aspect. This is so for a number of reasons.

<p>In the first place, in venerating with particular love the glorious
Theotokos and in acclaiming her as the "Hope of Christians,"[94]
 Catholics unite themselves with their brethren of the Orthodox Churches,
in which devotion to the Blessed Virgin finds its expression in a
beautiful lyricism and in solid doctrine. Catholics are also united with
Anglicans, whose classical theologians have already drawn attention to
the sound scriptural basis for devotion to the Mother of our Lord, while
those of the present day increasingly underline the importance of Mary's
place in the Christian life. Praising God with the very words of the
Virgin (cf. Lk. 1:46-55), they are united, too, with their brethren in
the Churches of the Reform, where love for the Sacred Scriptures
flourishes.

<p>For Catholics, devotion to the Mother of Christ and Mother of Christians
is also a natural and frequent opportunity for seeking her intercession
with her Son in order to obtain the union of all the baptized within a
single People of God.[95] Yet again, the ecumenical aspect of Marian
devotion is shown in the Catholic Church's desire that, without in any
way detracting from the unique character of this devotion,[96] every care
should be taken to avoid any exaggeration which could mislead other
Christian brethren about the true doctrine of the Catholic Church.[97]
 Similarly, the Church desires that any manifestation of cult which is
opposed to correct Catholic practice should be eliminated.

<p>Finally, since it is natural that in true devotion to the Blessed Virgin
"the Son should be duly known, loved and glorified. . .when the Mother is
honored,"[98] such devotion is an approach to Christ, the source and
center of ecclesiastical communion, in which all who openly confess that
He is God and Lord, Savior and sole Mediator (cf. 1 Tm. 2:5) are called
to be one, with one another, with Christ and with the Father in the unity
of the Holy Spirit.[99]

<p>33. We realize that there exist important differences between the thought
of many of our brethren in other Churches and ecclesial communities and
the Catholic doctrine on "Mary's role in the work of salvation."[100] In
consequence there are likewise differences of opinion on the devotion
which should be shown to her. Nevertheless, since it is the same power of
the Most High which overshadowed the Virgin of Nazareth (cf. Lk. 1:35)
and which today is at work within the ecumenical movement and making it
fruitful, we wish to express our confidence that devotion to the humble
handmaid of the Lord, in whom the Almighty has done great things (cf. Lk.
1:49), will become, even if only slowly, not an obstacle but a path and a
rallying point for the union of all who believe in Christ. We are glad to
see that, in fact, a better understanding of Mary's place in the mystery
of Christ and of the Church on the part also of our separated brethren is
smoothing the path to union. Just as at Cana the Blessed Virgin's
intervention resulted in Christ's performing His first miracle (cf. Jn.
2:1-12), so today her intercession can help to bring to realization the
time when the disciples of Christ will again find full communion in
faith. This hope of ours is strengthened by a remark of our predecessor
Leo XIII, who wrote that the cause of Christian unity "properly pertains
to the role of Mary's spiritual motherhood. For Mary did not and cannot
engender those who belong to Christ, except in one faith and one love:
for 'Is Christ divided?' (1 Cor. 1:13) We must all live together the life
of Christ, so that in one and the same body 'we may bear fruit for God'
(Rom. 7:4).[101]

<p>34. Devotion to the Blessed Virgin must also pay close attention to
certain findings of the human sciences. This will help to eliminate one
of the causes of the difficulties experienced in devotion to the Mother
of the Lord, namely, the discrepancy existing between some aspects of
this devotion and modern anthropological discoveries and the profound
changes which have occurred in the psycho-sociological field in which
modern man lives and works. The picture of the Blessed Virgin presented
in a certain type of devotional literature cannot easily be reconciled
with today's life-style, especially the way women live today. In the
home, woman's equality and co-responsibility with man in the running of
the family are being justly recognized by laws and the evolution of
customs. In the sphere of politics women have in many countries gained a
position in public life equal to that of men. In the social field women
are at work in a whole range of different employments, getting further
away every day from the restricted surroundings of the home. In the
cultural field new possibilities are opening up for women in scientific
research and intellectual activities.

<p>In consequence of these phenomena some people are becoming disenchanted
with devotion to the Blessed Virgin and finding it difficult to take as
an example Mary of Nazareth because the horizons of her life, so they
say, seem rather restricted in comparison with the vast spheres of
activity open to mankind today. In this regard we exhort theologians,
those responsible for the local Christian communities and the faithful
themselves to examine these difficulties with due care. At the same time
we wish to take the opportunity of offering our own contribution to their
solution by making a few observations.

<p>35. First, the Virgin Mary has always been proposed to the faithful by
the Church as an example to be imitated, not precisely in the type of
life she led, and much less for the socio-cultural background in which
she lived and which today scarcely exists anywhere. She is held up as an
example to the faithful rather for the way in which, in her own
particular life, she fully and responsibly accepted the will of God (cf.
Lk. 1:38), because she heard the word of God and acted on it, and because
charity and a spirit of service were the driving force of her actions.
She is worthy of imitation because she was the first and the most perfect
of Christ's disciples. All of this has a permanent and universal
exemplary value.

<p>36. Secondly, we would like to point out that the difficulties alluded to
above are closely related to certain aspects of the image of Mary found
in popular writings. They are not connected with the Gospel image of Mary
nor with the doctrinal data which have been made explicit through a slow
and conscientious process of drawing from Revelation. It should be
considered quite normal for succeeding generations of Christians in
differing socio-cultural contexts to have expressed their sentiments
about the Mother of Jesus in a way and manner which reflected their own
age. In contemplating Mary and her mission these different generations of
Christians, looking on her as the New Woman and perfect Christian, found
in her as a virgin, wife and mother the outstanding type of womanhood and
the pre-eminent exemplar of life lived in accordance with the Gospels and
summing up the most characteristic situations in the life of a woman.
When the Church considers the long history of Marian devotion she
rejoices at the continuity of the element of cult which it shows, but she
does not bind herself to any particular expression of an individual
cultural epoch or to the particular anthropological ideas underlying such
expressions. The Church understands that certain outward religious
expressions, while perfectly valid in themselves, may be less suitable to
men and women of different ages and cultures.

<p>37. Finally, we wish to point out that our own time, no less than former
times, is called upon to verify its knowledge of reality with the word of
God, and, keeping to the matter at present under consideration, to
compare its anthropological ideas and the problems springing therefrom
with the figure of the Virgin Mary as presented by the Gospel. The
reading of the divine Scriptures, carried out under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, and with the discoveries of the human sciences and the
different situations in the world today being taken into account, will
help us to see how Mary can be considered a mirror of the expectations of
the men and women of our time. Thus, the modern woman, anxious to
participate with decision-making power in the affairs of the community,
will contemplate with intimate joy Mary who, taken into dialogue with
God, gives her active and responsible consent,[102] not to the solution
of a contingent problem, but to that "event of world importance," as the
Incarnation of the Word has been rightly called.[103] The modern woman
will appreciate that Mary's choice of the state of virginity, which in
God's plan prepared her for the mystery of the Incarnation, was not a
rejection of any of the values of the married state but a courageous
choice which she made in order to consecrate herself totally to the love
of God. The modern woman will note with pleasant surprise that Mary of
Nazareth, while completely devoted to the will of God, was far from being
a timidly submissive woman or one whose piety was repellent to others; on
the contrary, she was a woman who did not hesitate to proclaim that God
vindicates the humble and the oppressed, and removes the powerful people
of this world from their privileged positions (cf. Lk. 1:51-53). The
modern woman will recognize in Mary, who "stands out among the poor and
humble of the Lord,"[104] a woman of strength, who experienced poverty
and suffering, flight and exile (cf. Mt. 2:13-23). These are situations
that cannot escape the attention of those who wish to support, with the
Gospel spirit, the liberating energies of man and of society. And Mary
will appear not as a Mother exclusively concerned with her own divine
Son, but rather as a woman whose action helped to strengthen the
apostolic community's faith in Christ (cf. Jn. 2:1-12), and whose
maternal role was extended and became universal on Calvary.[105] These
are but examples, but examples which show clearly that the figure of the
Blessed Virgin does not disillusion any of the profound expectations of
the men and women of our time but offers them the perfect model of the
disciple of the Lord: the disciple who builds up the earthly and temporal
city while being a diligent pilgrim towards the heavenly and eternal
city; the disciple who works for that justice which sets free the
oppressed and for that charity which assists the needy; but above all,
the disciple who is the active witness of that love which builds up
Christ in people's hearts.

<p>38. Having offered these directives, which are intended to favor the
harmonious development of devotion to the Mother of the Lord, we consider
it opportune to draw attention to certain attitudes of piety which are
incorrect. The Second Vatican Council has already authoritatively
denounced both the exaggeration of content and form which even falsifies
doctrine and likewise the small-mindedness which obscures the figure and
mission of Mary. The Council has also denounced certain devotional
deviations, such as vain credulity, which substitutes reliance on merely
external practices for serious commitment. Another deviation is sterile
and ephemeral sentimentality, so alien to the spirit of the Gospel that
demands persevering and practical action.[106] We reaffirm the Council's
reprobation of such attitudes and practices. They are not in harmony with
the Catholic Faith and therefore they must have no place in Catholic
worship. Careful defense against these errors and deviations will render
devotion to the Blessed Virgin more vigorous and more authentic. It will
make this devotion solidly based, with the consequence that study of the
sources of Revelation and attention to the documents of the magisterium
will prevail over the exaggerated search for novelties or extraordinary
phenomena. It will ensure that this devotion is objective in its
historical setting, and for this reason everything that is obviously
legendary or false must be eliminated. It will ensure that this devotion
matches its doctrinal content--hence the necessity of avoiding a
one-sided presentation of the figure of Mary, which by overstressing one
element compromises the overall picture given by the Gospel. It will make
this devotion clear in its motivation; hence every unworthy self-interest
is to be carefully banned from the area of what is sacred.

<p>39. Finally, insofar as it may be necessary we would like to repeat that
the ultimate purpose of devotion to the Blessed Virgin is to glorify God
and to lead Christians to commit themselves to a life which is in
absolute conformity with His will. When the children of the Church unite
their voices with the voice of the unknown woman in the Gospel and
glorify the Mother of Jesus by saying to Him: "Blessed is the womb that
bore you and the breasts that you sucked" (Lk. 11:27), they will be led
to ponder the Divine Master's serious reply: "Blessed rather are those
who hear the word of God and keep it!" (Lk. 11:28) While it is true that
this reply is in itself lively praise of Mary, as various Fathers of the
Church interpreted it[107] and the Second Vatican Council has
confirmed,[108] it is also an admonition to us to live our lives in
accordance with God's commandments. It is also an echo of other words of
the Savior: "Not every one who says to me 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven" (Mt. 7:21); and again: "You are my friends if you do what I
command you" (Jn. 15:14).

<p>40. We have indicated a number of principles which can help to give fresh
vigor to devotion to the Mother of the Lord. It is now up to episcopal
conferences, to those in charge of local communities and to the various
religious congregations prudently to revise practices and exercises of
piety in honor of the Blessed Virgin, and to encourage the creative
impulse of those who through genuine religious inspiration or pastoral
sensitivity wish to establish new forms of piety. For different reasons
we nevertheless feel it is opportune to consider here two practices which
are widespread in the West, and with which this Apostolic See has
concerned itself on various occasions: the Angelus and the Rosary.

<p>41. What we have to say about the Angelus is meant to be only a simple
but earnest exhortation to continue its traditional recitation wherever
and whenever possible. The Angelus does not need to be revised, because
of its simple structure, its biblical character, its historical origin
which links it to the prayer for peace and safety, and its
quasi-liturgical rhythm which sanctifies different moments during the
day, and because it reminds us of the Paschal Mystery, in which recalling
the Incarnation of the Son of God we pray that we may be led "through his
passion and cross to the glory of his resurrection."[109] These factors
ensure that the Angelus despite the passing of centuries retains an
unaltered value and an intact freshness. It is true that certain customs
traditionally linked with the recitation of the Angelus have disappeared
or can continue only with difficulty in modern life. But these are
marginal elements. The value of contemplation on the mystery of the
Incarnation of the Word, of the greeting to the Virgin, and of recourse
to her merciful intercession remains unchanged. And despite the changed
conditions of the times, for the majority of people there remain
unaltered the characteristic periods of the day--morning, noon and
evening--which mark the periods of their activity and constitute an
invitation to pause in prayer.

<p>42. We wish now, venerable Brothers, to dwell for a moment on the renewal
of the pious practice which has been called "the compendium of the entire
Gospel"[110]: the Rosary. To this our predecessors have devoted close
attention and care. On many occasions they have recommended its frequent
recitation, encouraged its diffusion, explained its nature, recognized
its suitability for fostering contemplative prayer--prayer of both praise
and petition--and recalled its intrinsic effectiveness for promoting
Christian life and apostolic commitment.

<p>We, too, from the first general audience of our pontificate on July 13,
1963, have shown our great esteem for the pious practice of the
Rosary.[111] Since that time we have underlined its value on many
different occasions, some ordinary, some grave. Thus, at a moment of
anguish and uncertainty, we published the Letter Christi Matri (September
15, 1966), in order to obtain prayers to Our Lady of the Rosary and to
implore from God the supreme benefit of peace.[112] We renewed this
appeal in our Apostolic Exhortation Recurrens mensis October (October 7,
1969), in which we also commemorated the fourth centenary of the
Apostolic Letter Consueverunt Romani pontifices of our predecessor Saint
Pius V, who in that document explained and in a certain sense established
the traditional form of the Rosary.[113]

<p>43. Our assiduous and affectionate interest in the Rosary has led us to
follow very attentively the numerous meetings which in recent years have
been devoted to the pastoral role of the Rosary in the modern world,
meetings arranged by associations and individuals profoundly attached to
the Rosary and attended by bishops, priests, religious and lay people of
proven experience and recognized ecclesial awareness. Among these people
special mention should be made of the sons of Saint Dominic, by tradition
the guardians and promoters of this very salutary practice. Parallel with
such meetings has been the research work of historians, work aimed not at
defining in a sort of archaeological fashion the primitive form of the
Rosary but at uncovering the original inspiration and driving force
behind it and its essential structure. The fundamental characteristics of
the Rosary, its essential elements and their mutual relationship have all
emerged more clearly from these congresses and from the research carried
out.

<p>44. Thus, for instance, the Gospel inspiration of the Rosary has appeared
more clearly: the Rosary draws from the Gospel the presentation of the
mysteries and its main formulas. As it moves from the angel's joyful
greeting and the Virgin's pious assent, the Rosary takes its inspiration
from the Gospel to suggest the attitude with which the faithful should
recite it. In the harmonious succession of Hail Mary's the Rosary puts
before us once more a fundamental mystery of the Gospel--the Incarnation
of the Word, contemplated at the decisive moment of the Annunciation to
Mary. The Rosary is thus a Gospel prayer, as pastors and scholars like to
define it, more today perhaps than in the past.

<p>45. It has also been more easily seen how the orderly and gradual
unfolding of the Rosary reflects the very way in which the Word of God,
mercifully entering into human affairs, brought about the Redemption. The
Rosary considers in harmonious succession the principal salvific events
accomplished in Christ, from His virginal conception and the mysteries of
His childhood to the culminating moments of the Passover--the blessed
passion and the glorious resurrection--and to the effects of this on the
infant Church on the day of Pentecost, and on the Virgin Mary when at the
end of her earthly life she was assumed body and soul into her heavenly
home. It has also been observed that the division of the mysteries of the
Rosary into three parts not only adheres strictly to the chronological
order of the facts but above all reflects the plan of the original
proclamation of the Faith and sets forth once more the mystery of Christ
in the very way in which it is seen by Saint Paul in the celebrated
"hymn" of the Letter to the Philippians--kenosis, death and exaltation
(cf. 2:6-11).

<p>46. As a Gospel prayer, centered on the mystery of the redemptive
Incarnation, the Rosary is therefore a prayer with a clearly
Christological orientation. Its most characteristic element, in fact, the
litany-like succession of Hail Mary's, becomes in itself an unceasing
praise of Christ, who is the ultimate object both of the angel's
announcement and of the greeting of the mother of John the Baptist:
"Blessed is the fruit of your womb" (Lk. 1:42). We would go further and
say that the succession of Hail Mary's constitutes the warp on which is
woven the contemplation of the mysteries. The Jesus that each Hail Mary
recalls is the same Jesus whom the succession of the mysteries proposes
to us--now as the Son of God, now as the Son of the Virgin--at His birth
in a stable at Bethlehem, at His presentation by His Mother in the
Temple, as a youth full of zeal for His Father's affairs, as the Redeemer
in agony in the garden, scourged and crowned with thorns, carrying the
cross and dying on Calvary; risen from the dead and ascended to the glory
of the Father to send forth the gift of the Spirit. As is well known, at
one time there was a custom, still preserved in certain places, of adding
to the name of Jesus in each Hail Mary a reference to the mystery being
contemplated. And this was done precisely in order to help contemplation
and to make the mind and the voice act in unison.

<p>47. There has also been felt with greater urgency the need to point out
once more the importance of a further essential element in the Rosary, in
addition to the value of the elements of praise and petition, namely the
element of contemplation. Without this the Rosary is a body without a
soul, and its recitation is in danger of becoming a mechanical repetition
of formulas and of going counter to the warning of Christ: "And in
praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think
that they will be heard for their many words" (Mt. 6:7). By its nature
the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering
pace, helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord's
life as seen through the eyes of her who was closest to the Lord. In this
way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are unfolded.

<p>48. Finally, as a result of modern reflection the relationships between
the liturgy and the Rosary have been more clearly understood. On the one
hand it has been emphasized that the Rosary is, as it were, a branch
sprung from the ancient trunk of the Christian liturgy, the Psalter of
the Blessed Virgin, whereby the humble were associated in the Church's
hymn of praise and universal intercession. On the other hand it has been
noted that this development occurred at a time--the last period of the
Middle Ages--when the liturgical spirit was in decline and the faithful
were turning from the liturgy towards a devotion to Christ's humanity and
to the Blessed Virgin Mary, a devotion favoring a certain external
sentiment of piety. Not many years ago some people began to express the
desire to see the Rosary included among the rites of the liturgy, while
other people, anxious to avoid repetition of former pastoral mistakes,
unjustifiably disregarded the Rosary. Today the problem can easily be
solved in the light of the principles of the Constitution Sacrosanctum
concilium. Liturgical celebrations and the pious practice of the Rosary
must be neither set in opposition to one another nor considered as being
identical.[114] The more an expression of prayer preserves its own true
nature and individual characteristics the more fruitful it becomes. Once
the pre-eminent value of liturgical rites has been reaffirmed it will not
be difficult to appreciate the fact that the Rosary is a practice of
piety which easily harmonizes with the liturgy. In fact, like the
liturgy, it is of a community nature, draws its inspiration from Sacred
Scripture and is oriented towards the mystery of Christ. The
commemoration in the liturgy and the contemplative remembrance proper to
the Rosary, although existing on essentially different planes of reality,
have as their object the same salvific events wrought by Christ. The
former presents anew, under the veil of signs and operative in a hidden
way, the great mysteries of our Redemption. The latter, by means of
devout contemplation, recalls these same mysteries to the mind of the
person praying and stimulates the will to draw from them the norms of
living. Once this substantial difference has been established, it is not
difficult to understand that the Rosary is an exercise of piety that
draws its motivating force from the liturgy and leads naturally back to
it, if practiced in conformity with its original inspiration. It does
not, however, become part of the liturgy. In fact, meditation on the
mysteries of the Rosary, by familiarizing the hearts and minds of the
faithful with the mysteries of Christ, can be an excellent preparation
for the celebration of those same mysteries in the liturgical action and
can also become a continuing echo thereof. However, it is a mistake to
recite the Rosary during the celebration of the liturgy, though
unfortunately this practice still persists here and there.

<p>49. The Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, according to the tradition
accepted by our predecessor St. Pius V and authoritatively taught by him,
consists of various elements disposed in an organic fashion:

<blockquote>
a) Contemplation in communion with Mary, of a series of mysteries of
salvation, wisely distributed into three cycles. These mysteries express
the joy of the messianic times, the salvific suffering of Christ and the
glory of the Risen Lord which fills the Church. This contemplation by its
very nature encourages practical reflection and provides stimulating
norms for living.

<p>b) The Lord's Prayer, or Our Father, which by reason of its immense value
is at the basis of Christian prayer and ennobles that prayer in its
various expressions.

<p>c) The litany-like succession of the Hail Mary, which is made up of the
angel's greeting to the Virgin (cf. Lk. 1:28), and of Elizabeth's
greeting (cf. Lk. 1:42), followed by the ecclesial supplication, Holy
Mary. The continued series of Hail Mary's is the special characteristic
of the Rosary, and their number, in the full and typical number of one
hundred and fifty, presents a certain analogy with the Psalter and is an
element that goes back to the very origin of the exercise of piety. But
this number, divided, according to a well-tried custom, into decades
attached to the individual mysteries, is distributed in the three cycles
already mentioned, thus giving rise to the Rosary of fifty Hail Mary's as
we know it. This latter has entered into use as the normal measure of the
pious exercise and as such has been adopted by popular piety and approved
by papal authority, which also enriched it with numerous indulgences .

<p>d) The doxology Glory be to the Father which, in conformity with an
orientation common to Christian piety, concludes the prayer with the
glorifying of God who is one and three, from whom, through whom and in
whom all things have their being (cf. Rom. 11:36).
</blockquote>

50. These are the elements of the Rosary. Each has its own particular
character which, wisely understood and appreciated, should be reflected
in the recitation in order that the Rosary may express all its richness
and variety. Thus the recitation will be grave and suppliant during the
Lord's Prayer, Iyrical and full of praise during the tranquil succession
of Hail Mary's, contemplative in the recollected meditation on the
mysteries and full of adoration during the doxology. This applies to all
the ways in which the Rosary is usually recited: privately, in intimate
recollection with the Lord; in community, in the family or in groups of
the faithful gathered together to ensure the special presence of the Lord
(cf. Mt. 18:20); or publicly, in assemblies to which the ecclesial
community is invited.

<p>51. In recent times certain exercises of piety have been created which
take their inspiration from the Rosary. Among such exercises we wish to
draw attention to and recommend those which insert into the ordinary
celebration of the word of God some elements of the Rosary, such as
meditation on the mysteries and litany-like repetition of the angel's
greeting to Mary. In this way these elements gain in importance, since
they are found in the context of Bible readings, illustrated with a
homily, accompanied by silent pauses and emphasized with song. We are
happy to know that such practices have helped to promote a more complete
understanding of the spiritual riches of the Rosary itself and have
served to restore esteem for its recitation among youth associations and
movements.

<p>52. We now desire, as a continuation of the thought of our predecessors,
to recommend strongly the recitation of the family Rosary. The Second
Vatican Council has pointed out how the family, the primary and vital
cell of society, "shows itself to be the domestic sanctuary of the Church
through the mutual affection of its members and the common prayer they
offer to God."[115] The Christian family is thus seen to be a domestic
Church[116] if its members, each according to his proper place and tasks,
all together promote justice, practice works of mercy, devote themselves
to helping their brethren, take part in the apostolate of the wider local
community and play their part in its liturgical worship.[117] This will
be all the more true if together they offer up prayers to God. If this
element of common prayer were missing, the family would lack its very
character as a domestic Church. Thus there must logically follow a
concrete effort to reinstate communal prayer in family life if there is
to be a restoration of the theological concept of the family as the
domestic Church.

<p>53. In accordance with the directives of the Council the Institutio
Generalis de Liturgia Horarum rightly numbers the family among the groups
in which the Divine Office can suitably be celebrated in community: "It
is fitting. . .that the family, as a domestic sanctuary of the Church,
should not only offer prayers to God in common, but also, according to
circumstances, should recite parts of the Liturgy of the Hours, in order
to be more intimately linked with the Church."[118] No avenue should be
left unexplored to ensure that this clear and practical recommendation
finds within Christian families growing and joyful acceptance.

<p>54. But there is no doubt that, after the celebration of the Liturgy of
the Hours, the high point which family prayer can reach, the Rosary
should be considered as one of the best and most efficacious prayers in
common that the Christian family is invited to recite. We like to think,
and sincerely hope, that when the family gathering becomes a time of
prayer, the Rosary is a frequent and favored manner of praying. We are
well aware that the changed conditions of life today do not make family
gatherings easy, and that even when such a gathering is possible many
circumstances make it difficult to turn it into an occasion of prayer.
There is no doubt of the difficulty. But it is characteristic of the
Christian in his manner of life not to give in to circumstances but to
overcome them, not to succumb but to make an effort. Families which want
to live in full measure the vocation and spirituality proper to the
Christian family must therefore devote all their energies to overcoming
the pressures that hinder family gatherings and prayer in common.

<p>55. In concluding these observations, which give proof of the concern and
esteem which the Apostolic See has for the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin,
we desire at the same time to recommend that this very worthy devotion
should not be propagated in a way that is too one-sided or exclusive. The
Rosary is an excellent prayer, but the faithful should feel serenely free
in its regard. They should be drawn to its calm recitation by its
intrinsic appeal.

<p>56. Venerable Brothers, as we come to the end of this our Apostolic
Exhortation we wish to sum up and emphasize the theological value of
devotion to the Blessed Virgin and to recall briefly its pastoral
effectiveness for renewing the Christian way of life.

<p>The Church's devotion to the Blessed Virgin is an intrinsic element of
Christian worship. The honor which the Church has always and everywhere
shown to the Mother of the Lord, from the blessing with which Elizabeth
greeted Mary (cf. Lk. 1:42-45) right up to the expressions of praise and
petition used today, is a very strong witness to the Church's norm of
prayer and an invitation to become more deeply conscious of her norm of
faith. And the converse is likewise true. The Church's norm of faith
requires that her norm of prayer should everywhere blossom forth with
regard to the Mother of Christ. Such devotion to the Blessed Virgin is
firmly rooted in the revealed word and has solid dogmatic foundations. It
is based on the singular dignity of Mary, "Mother of the Son of God, and
therefore beloved daughter of the Father and Temple of the Holy
Spirit--Mary, who, because of this extraordinary grace, is far greater
than any other creature on earth or in heaven."[119] This devotion takes
into account the part she played at decisive moments in the history of
the salvation which her Son accomplished, and her holiness, already full
at her Immaculate Conception yet increasing all the time as she obeyed
the will of the Father and accepted the path of suffering (cf. Lk.
2:34-35, 41-52; Jn. 19:25-27), growing constantly in faith, hope and
charity. Devotion to Mary recalls too her mission and the special
position she holds within the People of God, of which she is the
preeminent member, a shining example and the loving Mother; it recalls
her unceasing and efficacious intercession which, although she is assumed
into heaven, draws her close to those who ask her help, including those
who do not realize that they are her children. It recalls Mary's glory
which ennobles the whole of mankind, as the outstanding phrase of Dante
recalls: "You have so ennobled human nature that its very Creator did not
disdain to share in it."[120] Mary, in fact, is one of our race, a true
daughter of Eve--though free of that mother's sin--and truly our sister,
who as a poor and humble woman fully shared our lot.

<p>We would add further that devotion to the Blessed Virgin finds its
ultimate justification in the unfathomable and free will of God who,
being eternal and divine charity (cf. 1 Jn. 4:7-8, 16), accomplishes all
things according to a loving design. He loved her and did great things
for her (cf. Lk. 1:49). He loved her for His own sake, and He loved her
for our sake, too; He gave her to Himself and He gave her also to us.

<p>57. Christ is the only way to the Father (cf. Jn. 14:4-11), and the
ultimate example to whom the disciple must conform his own conduct (cf.
Jn. 13:15), to the extent of sharing Christ's sentiments (cf. Phil. 2:5),
living His life and possessing His Spirit (cf. Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:10-11).
The Church has always taught this and nothing in pastoral activity should
obscure this doctrine. But the Church, taught by the Holy Spirit and
benefiting from centuries of experience, recognizes that devotion to the
Blessed Virgin, subordinated to worship of the divine Savior and in
connection with it, also has a great pastoral effectiveness and
constitutes a force for renewing Christian living. It is easy to see the
reason for this effectiveness. Mary's many-sided mission to the People of
God is a supernatural reality which operates and bears fruit within the
body of the Church. One finds cause for joy in considering the different
aspects of this mission, and seeing how each of these aspects with its
individual effectiveness is directed towards the same end, namely,
producing in the children the spiritual characteristics of the first-born
Son. The Virgin's maternal intercession, her exemplary holiness and the
divine grace which is in her become for the human race a reason for
divine hope.

<p>The Blessed Virgin's role as Mother leads the People of God to turn with
filial confidence to her who is ever ready to listen with a mother's
affection and efficacious assistance.[121] Thus the People of God have
learned to call on her as the Consoler of the afflicted, the Health of
the sick, and the Refuge of sinners, that they may find comfort in
tribulation, relief in sickness and liberating strength in guilt. For
she, who is free from sin, leads her children to combat sin with energy
and resoluteness.[122] This liberation from sin and evil (cf. Mt.
6:13)--it must be repeated--is the necessary premise for any renewal of
Christian living.

<p>The Blessed Virgin's exemplary holiness encourages the faithful to "raise
their eyes to Mary who shines forth before the whole community of the
elect as a model of the virtues."[123] It is a question of solid,
evangelical virtues: faith and the docile acceptance of the Word of God
(cf. Lk. 1:26-38, 1:45, 11:27-28, Jn. 2:5); generous obedience (cf. Lk.
1:38); genuine humility (cf. Lk. 1:48); solicitous charity (cf. Lk.
1:39-56); profound wisdom (cf. Lk. 1:29, 34; 2:19, 33:51); worship of God
manifested in alacrity in the fulfillment of religious duties (cf. Lk.
2:2141), in gratitude for gifts received (cf. Lk. 1:46-49), in her
offering in the Temple (cf. Lk. 2:22-24) and in her prayer in the midst
of the apostolic community (cf. Acts 1:12-14); her fortitude in exile
(cf. Mt. 2:13-23) and in suffering (cf. Lk. 2:34-35, 49; Jn. 19:25); her
poverty reflecting dignity and trust in God (cf. Lk. 1:48, 2:24); her
attentive care for her Son, from His humble birth to the ignominy of the
cross (cf. Lk. 2:1-7; Jn. 19:25-27); her delicate forethought (cf. Jn.
2:1-11); her virginal purity (cf. Mt. 1:18-25; Lk. 1:26-38); her strong
and chaste married love. These virtues of the Mother will also adorn her
children who steadfastly study her example in order to reflect it in
their own lives. And this progress in virtue will appear as the
consequence and the already mature fruit of that pastoral zeal which
springs from devotion to the Blessed Virgin.

<p>Devotion to the Mother of the Lord becomes for the faithful an
opportunity for growing in divine grace, and this is the ultimate aim of
all pastoral activity. For it is impossible to honor her who is "full of
grace" (Lk. 1:28) without thereby honoring in oneself the state of grace,
which is friendship with God, communion with Him and the indwelling of
the Holy Spirit. It is this divine grace which takes possession of the
whole man and conforms him to the image of the Son of God (cf. Rom. 8:29;
Col. 1:18). The Catholic Church, endowed with centuries of experience,
recognizes in devotion to the Blessed Virgin a powerful aid for man as he
strives for fulfillment. Mary, the New Woman, stands at the side of
Christ, the New Man, within whose mystery the mystery of man[124] alone
finds true light; she is given to us as a pledge and guarantee that God's
plan in Christ for the salvation of the whole man has already achieved
realization in a creature: in her. Contemplated in the episodes of the
Gospels and in the reality which she already possesses in the City of
God, the Blessed Virgin Mary offers a calm vision and a reassuring word
to modern man, torn as he often is between anguish and hope, defeated by
the sense of his own limitations and assailed by limitless aspirations,
troubled in his mind and divided in his heart, uncertain before the
riddle of death, oppressed by loneliness while yearning for fellowship, a
prey to boredom and disgust. She shows forth the victory of hope over
anguish, of fellowship over solitude, of peace over anxiety, of joy and
beauty over boredom and disgust, of eternal visions over earthly ones, of
life over death.

<p>Let the very words that she spoke to the servants at the marriage feast
of Cana, "Do whatever he tells you" (Jn. 2:5), be a seal on our
Exhortation and a further reason in favor of the pastoral value of
devotion to the Blessed Virgin as a means of leading men to Christ. Those
words, which at first sight were limited to the desire to remedy an
embarrassment at the feast, are seen in the context of Saint John's
Gospel to re-echo the words used by the people of Israel to give approval
to the Covenant at Sinai (cf. Ex. 19:8, 24:3, 7; Dt. 5:27) and to renew
their commitments (cf. Jos. 24:24; Ezr. 10:12; Neh. 5:12). And they are
words which harmonize wonderfully with those spoken by the Father at the
theophany on Mount Tabor: "Listen to him" (Mt. 17:5).

<p>58. Venerable Brothers, we have dealt at length with an integral element
of Christian worship: devotion to the Mother of the Lord. This has been
called for by the nature of the subject, one which in these recent years
has been the object of study and revision and at times the cause of some
perplexity. We are consoled to think that the work done by this Apostolic
See and by yourselves in order to carry out the norms of the
Council--particularly the liturgical reform--is a stepping-stone to an
ever more lively and adoring worship of God, the Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit, and to an increase of the Christian life of the
faithful. We are filled with confidence when we note that the renewed
Roman liturgy, also taken as a whole, is a splendid illustration of the
Church's devotion to the Blessed Virgin. We are upheld by the hope that
the directives issued in order to render this devotion ever more pure and
vigorous will be applied with sincerity. We rejoice that the Lord has
given us the opportunity of putting forward some points for reflection in
order to renew and confirm esteem for the practice of the rosary.
Comfort, confidence, hope and joy are the sentiments which we wish to
transform into fervent praise and thanksgiving to the Lord as we unite
our voice with that of the Blessed Virgin in accordance with the prayer
of the Roman Liturgy.[125]

<p>Dear Brothers, while we express the hope that, thanks to your generous
commitment, there will be among the clergy and among the people entrusted
to your care a salutary increase of devotion to Mary with undoubted
profit for the Church and for society, we cordially impart our special
apostolic blessing to yourselves and to all the faithful people to whom
you devote your pastoral zeal.

<p>Given in Rome, at Saint Peter's, on the second day of February, the Feast
of the Presentation of the Lord, in the year 1974, the eleventh of our
Pontificate.

<p>Paulus PP. VI.
