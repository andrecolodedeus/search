<h1>Mysterium Fidei</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on the Holy Eucharist
<br>His Holiness Pope Paul VI
<br>Promulgated on September 3, 1965</b>

<p><i>To our venerable brothers, the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops and other local Ordinaries in peace and communion with the Holy See, and to all the clergy and faithful of the world.</i>

<p>Venerable brothers and dear sons: Health and apostolic benediction.

<p>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH has always devoutly guarded as a most
precious treasure the mystery of faith, that is, the ineffable gift
of the Eucharist which she received from Christ her Spouse as a
pledge of His immense love, and during the Second Vatican Council in
a new and solemn demonstration she professed her faith and veneration
for this mystery. When dealing with the restoration of the sacred
liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral
concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance
to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and
with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy
Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their
own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it
spiritual nourishment.

<p>For if the sacred liturgy holds the first place in the life of
the Church, the Eucharistic Mystery stands at the heart and center of
the liturgy, since it is the font of life by which we are cleansed
and strengthened to live not for ourselves but for God, and to be
united in love among ourselves.

<p>To make evident the indissoluble bond which exists between faith
and devotion, the Fathers of the council, confirming the doctrine
which the Church has always held and taught and which was solemnly
defined by the Council of Trent, determine to introduce their
treatise on the Most Holy Mystery of the Eucharist with the following
summary of truths:

<p>"At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord
instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to
perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He
should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the
memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a
sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ
is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us
the pledge of future glory."[1]

<p>In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which
pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and
the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by
eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both
grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of
immortality. According to the words of Our Lord: "The man who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood enjoys eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day."[2]

<p>Therefore we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy
will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the
Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily
progress toward perfect unity[3] and may invite all Christians to a
unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action
of divine grace.

<p>We seem to have a preview of these fruits and, as it were, to
gather in the early results not only in the genuine joy and eagerness
with which the members of the Catholic Church have received both the
Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and the restoration of the
liturgy, but also in the great number of well-prepared publications
which seek to investigate more profoundly and to understand more
fruitfully the doctrine on the Holy Eucharist, with special reference
to its relation with the mystery of the Church.

<p>All of this is for us a cause of profound consolation and joy.
It is a great pleasure for us to communicate this to you, venerable
brothers, so that along with us you may give thanks to God, the giver
of all gifts, who with His Spirit rules the Church and enriches her
with increasing virtues.

<p align=center><b>REASONS FOR PASTORAL CONCERN AND ANXIETY</b></p>

<p>However, venerable brothers, in this very matter which we are
discussing, there are not lacking reasons for serious pastoral
concern and anxiety. The awareness of our apostolic duty does not
allow us to be silent in the face of these problems. Indeed, we are
aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy
Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who, with reference
either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of
transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad
opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no
little confusion about matters of faith. It is as if everyone were
permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the
Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the
genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts
involved.

<p>To confirm what we have said by examples, it is not allowable to
emphasize what is called the "communal" Mass to the disparagement of
Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of
sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in
the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of
Christ's presence in this sacrament. Nor is it allowable to discuss
the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council
of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance
of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine
into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called
"transignification" and transfiguration," or finally to propose and
act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts
which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass,
Christ Our Lord is no longer present.

<p>Everyone can see that the spread of these and similar opinions
does great harm to the faith and devotion to the Divine Eucharist.

<p>And therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a
flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole
Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have
with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers,
and to express our mind on this subject.

<p>We certainly do not wish to deny in those who are spreading
these singular opinions the praiseworthy effort to investigate this
lofty mystery and to set forth its inexhaustible riches, revealing
its meaning to the men of today; rather we acknowledge and approve
their effort. However, we cannot approve the opinions which they
express, and we have the duty to warn you about the grave danger
which these opinions involve for correct faith.

<p align=center><b>THE HOLY EUCHARIST IS A MYSTERY OF FAITH</b></p>

<p>First of all we wish to recall something which is well known to
you but which is altogether necessary for repelling every virus of
rationalism, something to which many illustrious martyrs have
witnessed with their blood, while celebrating Fathers and Doctors of
the Church constantly professed and taught it; that is, that the
Eucharist is a very great mystery. In fact, properly speaking, and
to use the words of the sacred liturgy, it is the Mystery of Faith.
"Indeed, in it alone," as Leo XIII our predecessor of happy memory
very wisely remarked, "are contained, in a remarkable richness and
variety of miracles, all supernatural realities."[4]

<p>We must therefore approach especially this mystery with humble
respect, not following human arguments, which ought to be silent, but
adhering firmly to divine revelation.

<p>St. John Chrysostom, who, as you know, treated of the
eucharistic mystery with such nobility of language and insight born
of devotion, instructing his faithful on one occasion about this
mystery, expressed these most fitting words:

<p>"Let us submit to God in all things and not contradict Him, even
if what He says seems contrary to our reason and intellect; rather
let His words prevail over our reason and intellect. Let us act in
this way with regard to the (eucharistic) mysteries, looking not only
at what falls under our senses but holding on to His words. For His
word cannot lead us astray."[5]

<p>The scholastic Doctors often made similar affirmations: That in
this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and His true Blood is
something that "cannot be apprehended by the senses," says St.
Thomas, "but only by faith which relies on divine authority. This is
why, in a comment on Luke 22:19 ('This is My Body which is given
for you'), St. Cyril says: 'Do not doubt whether this is true, but
rather receive the words of the Savior in faith, for since He is the
truth, He cannot lie.'"[6]

<p>Thus the Christian people, echoing the words of the same St.
Thomas, frequently sing the words: "Sight, touch, and taste in Thee
are each deceived, the ear alone most safely is believed. I believe
all the Son of God has spoken -- than truth's own word there is no
truer token."

<p>In fact, St. Bonaventure asserts: "There is no difficulty about
Christ's presence in the Eucharist as in a sign, but that He is truly
present in the Eucharist as He is in heaven, this is most difficult.
Therefore to believe this is especially meritorious."[7]

<p>Moreover, the Holy Gospel alludes to this when it tells of the
many disciples of Christ who, after listening to the sermon about
eating His Flesh and drinking His Blood, turned away and left our
Lord, saying: "This is strange talk, who can be expected to listen
to it?" Peter, on the other hand, in reply to Jesus' question
whether also the twelve wished to leave, expressed his faith and that
of the others promptly and resolutely with the marvelous answer:
"Lord, to whom should we go? Thy words are the words of eternal
life."[8]

<p>It is logical, then, that we should follow as a guiding star in
our investigations of this mystery the magisterium of the Church, to
which the Divine Redeemer entrusted for protection and for
explanation the revelation which He has communicated to us through
Scripture or tradition. For we are convinced that "what since the
days of antiquity was preached and believed throughout the whole
Church with true Catholic Faith is true, even if it is not submitted
to rational investigation, even if it is not explained by means of
words."[9]

<p>But this is not enough. Having safeguarded the integrity of the
faith, it is necessary to safeguard also its proper mode of
expression, lest by the careless use of words, we occasion (God
forbid) the rise of false opinions regarding faith in the most
sublime of mysteries. St. Augustine gives a stern warning about this
in his consideration of the way of speaking employed by the
philosophers of that which ought to be used by Christians.

<p>"The philosophers," he says, "speak freely without fear of
offending religious listeners on subjects quite difficult to
understand. We, on the other hand, must speak according to a fixed
norm, lest the lack of restraint in our speech result in some impious
opinion even about the things signified by the words themselves."[10]

<p>The Church, therefore, with the long labor of centuries, and,
not without the help of the Holy Spirit, has established a rule of
language and confirmed it with the authority of the councils. This
rule, which has more than once been the watchword and banner of
Orthodox faith, must be religiously preserved, and let no one presume
to change it at his own pleasure or under the pretext of new science.
Who would ever tolerate that the dogmatic formulas used by
ecumenical councils for the mysteries of the Holy Trinity and the
Incarnation be judged as no longer appropriate for men of our times
and therefore that others be rashly substituted for them? In the
same way it cannot be tolerated that any individual should on his own
authority modify the formulas which were used by the Council of Trent
to express belief in the Eucharistic Mystery. For these formulas,
like the others which the Church uses to propose the dogmas of faith,
express concepts which are not tied to a certain form of human
culture, nor to a specific phase of human culture, nor to one or
other theological school.

<p>No, these formulas present that part of reality which necessary
and universal experience permits the human mind to grasp and to
manifest with apt and exact terms taken either from common or
polished language. For this reason, these formulas are adapted to
men of all times and all places. But the most sacred task of
theology is, not the invention of new dogmatic formulas to replace
old ones, but rather such a defense and explanation of the formulas
adopted by the councils as may demonstrate that divine Revelation is
the source of the truths communicated through these expressions.

<p>It must be admitted that these formulas can sometimes be more
clearly and accurately explained. In fact, the achievement of this
goal is highly beneficial. But it would be wrong to give to these
expressions a meaning other than the original. Thus the
understanding of the faith should be advanced without threat to its
unchangeable truth. It is, in fact, the teaching of the First
Vatican Council that "the same signification (of sacred dogmas) is to
be forever retained once our Holy Mother the Church has defined it,
and under no pretext of deeper penetration may that meaning be
weakened."[11]

<p align=center><b>THE MYSTERY OF THE EUCHARIST IS VERIFIED IN THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS</b></p>

<p>For the inspiration and consolation of all, we wish to review
with you, venerable brothers, the doctrine which the Catholic Church
has always transmitted and unanimously teaches concerning the
Mystery of the Eucharist.

<p>We desire to recall at the very outset what may be termed the
very essence of the dogma, namely, that by means of the Mystery of
the Eucharist, the Sacrifice of the Cross, which was once offered on
Calvary, is remarkably re-enacted and constantly recalled, and its
saving power exerted for the forgiveness of those sins which we daily
commit.[12]

<p>Just as Moses with the blood of calves had sanctified the Old
Testament,[13] so also Christ Our Lord, through the institution of
the Mystery of the Eucharist, with His own Blood sanctified the New
Testament, whose Mediator He is. For, as the Evangelists narrate, at
the Last Supper "He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it
to them, saying: "This is My Body, given for you; do this for a
commemoration of Me. And so with the cup, when supper was ended.
This cup, he said, is the New Testament, in My Blood which is to be
shed for you.'"[14] And by bidding the Apostles to do this in memory
of Him, He made clear His will that the same sacrifice be forever
repeated.

<p>This intention of Christ was faithfully executed by the
primitive Church through her adherence to the teaching of the
Apostles and through her gatherings summoned to celebrate the
Eucharistic Sacrifice. As St. Luke carefully testifies, "These
occupied themselves continually with the Apostles' teaching, their
fellowship in the breaking of bread, and the fixed times of
prayer."[15] From this practice, the faithful used to derive such
spiritual strength that it was said of them that "there was one heart
and soul in all the company of believers."[16]

<p>Moreover, the Apostle Paul, who has faithfully transmitted to us
what he had received from the Lord,[17] is clearly speaking of the
Eucharistic Sacrifice when he points out that Christians, precisely
because they have been made partakers of the table of the Lord, ought
not take part in pagan sacrifices. "Is not this cup we bless," he
says, "a participation in Christ's Blood? Is not the Bread we break
a participation in Christ's Body? . . . To drink the Lord's cup, and
yet to drink the cup of evil spirits, to share the Lord's feast, and
to share the feast of evil spirits, is impossible for you."[18]
Foreshadowed by Malachias,[19] this new offering of the New Testament
has always been offered by the Church, in accordance with the
teaching of Our Lord and Apostles, "Not only to atone for the sins of
the living faithful and to appeal for their other needs, but also to
help these who have died in Christ but have not yet been completely
purified."[20]

<p>Passing over other citations, we recall merely the testimony
rendered by St. Cyril of Jerusalem, who wrote the follow memorable
instruction for his neophytes:

<p>"After the Spiritual Sacrifice, the unbloody act of worship has
been completed. Bending over this propitiatory offering we beg God
to grant peace to all the Churches, to give harmony to the whole
world, to bless our rulers, our soldiers, and our companions, to aid
the sick and afflicted, and in general to assist all who stand in
need; and then we offer the Victim also for our deceased holy
ancestors and bishops for all our dead. As we do this, we are filled
with the conviction that this Sacrifice will be of the greatest help
to those souls for whom prayers are being offered in the very
presence of our holy and awesome Victim."

<p>This holy Doctor closes his instruction by citing the parallel
of the crown which is woven for the emperor to move him to pardon
exiles: "In the same fashion, when we offer our prayers to God for
the dead, even though they be sinners, we weave no crown, but instead
we offer Christ slaughtered for our sins, beseeching our merciful God
to take pity both on them and on ourselves."[21]

<p>At. Augustine testifies that this manner of offering also for
the deceased "the Sacrifice which ransomed us" was being faithfully
observed in the Church at Rome,[22] and at the same time he observes
that the universal Church was following this custom in her conviction
that it had been handed down by the earliest Fathers.[23]

<p>To shed fuller light on the mystery of the Church, it helps to
realize that it is nothing less than the whole Church which, in union
with Christ in His role as Priest and Victim, offers the Sacrifice of
the Mass and is offered in it. The Fathers of the Church taught this
wondrous doctrine.[24] A few years ago our predecessor of happy
memory, Pius XII, explained it,[25] and only recently the Second
Vatican Council enunciated it in its treatise on the People of God as
formulated in its Constitution on the Church.[26]

<p>To be sure, the distinction between universal priesthood and
hierarchical priesthood is one of essence and not merely one of
degree,[27] and this distinction should be faithfully observed. Yet
we cannot fail to be filled with the earnest desire that this
teaching on the Mass be explained over and over until it takes root
deep in the hearts of the faithful. Our desire is founded on our
conviction that the correct understanding of the Eucharistic Mystery
is the most effective means to foster devotion to this Sacrament, to
extol the dignity of all the faithfully, and to spur their spirit
toward the attainment of the summit of sanctity, which is nothing
less than the total offering of oneself to service of the Divine
Majesty.

<p>We should also mention "the public and social nature of every
Mass,"[28] a conclusion which clearly follows from the doctrine we
have been discussing. For even though a priest should offer Mass in
private, that Mass is not something private; it is an act of Christ
and of the Church. In offering this Sacrifice, the Church learns to
offer herself as a sacrifice for all. Moreover, for the salvation of
the entire world she applies the single, boundless, redemptive power
of the Sacrifice of the Cross. For every Mass is offered not for the
salvation of ourselves alone, but also for that of the whole world.

<p>Hence, although the very nature of the action renders most
appropriate the active participation of many of the faithful in the
celebration of the Mass, nevertheless, that Mass is to be fully
approved which, in conformity with the prescriptions and lawful
traditions of the Church, a priest for a sufficient reason offers in
private, that is, in the presence of no one except his server. From
such a Mass an abundant treasure of special salutary graces enriches
the celebrant, the faithful, the whole Church, and the entire
world -- graces which are not imparted in the same abundance by the
mere reception of Holy Communion.

<p>Therefore, from a paternal and solicitous heart, we recommend
to priests, who bestow on us a special crown of happiness in the
Lord, that they be mindful of their power, received through the hands
of the ordaining Bishop, of offering sacrifices to God and of
celebrating Masses both for the living and for the dead in the name
of the Lord,[29] and that they worthily and devoutly offer Mass each
day in order that both they and the rest of the faithful may enjoy
the benefits that flow so richly from the Sacrifice of the Cross.
Thus also they will contribute most to the salvation of the human race.

<p align=center><b>IN THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS CHRIST IS MADE SACRAMENTALLY PRESENT</b></p>

<p>By the few ideas which we have mentioned regarding the Sacrifice
of the Mass, we are encouraged to explain a few notions concerning
the Sacrament of the Eucharist, seeing that both sacrifice and
Sacrament pertain inseparably to the same mystery. In an unbloody
representation of the Sacrifice of the Cross and in application of
its saving power, in the Sacrifice of the Mass the Lord is immolated
when, through the words of consecration, He begins to be present in a
sacramental form under the appearances of bread and wine to become
the spiritual food of the faithful.

<p>All of us realize that there is more than one way in which
Christ is present in His Church. We wish to review at greater length
the consoling doctrine which was briefly set forth in the
constitution "De Sacra Liturgia."[30] Christ is present in His
Church when she prays, since it is He who "prays for us and prays in
us and to whom we pray as to our God."[31] It is He who has
promised: "Where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am
there in the midst of them."[32]

<p>He is present in the Church as she performs her works of mercy,
not only because we do to Christ whatever good we do to one of His
least brethren,[33] but also because it is Christ, performing these
works through the Church, who continually assists men with His divine
love. He is present in the Church on her pilgrimage of struggle to
reach the harbor of eternal life, since it is He who through faith
dwells in our hearts[34] and, through the Holy Spirit whom He gives
us, pours His love into those hearts.[35]

<p>In still another genuine way He is present in the Church as she
preaches, since the Gospel which eh proclaims is the Word of God,
which is not preached except in the name of Christ, by the authority
of Christ, and with the assistance of Christ, the Incarnate Word of
God. In this way there is formed "one flock which trusts its only
shepherd."[36]

<p>He is present in His Church as she governs the People of God,
since her sacred power comes from Christ, and since Christ, "The
Shepherd of Shepherds,"[37] is present in the pastors who exercise
that power, according to His promise to the Apostles: "Behold I am
with you all through the days that are coming, until the consummation
of the world."

<p>Moreover, in a manner still more sublime, Christ is present in
His Church as she offers in His name the Sacrifice of the Mass; He is
present in her as she administers the sacraments. We find deep
consolation in recalling the accurate and eloquent words with which
St. John Chrysostom overcome with a sense of awe, described the
presence of Christ in the offering of the Sacrifice of the Mass: "I
wish to add something that is plainly awe-inspiring, but do not be
astonished or upset. This Sacrifice, no matter who offers it, be it
Peter or Paul, is always the same as that which Christ gave His
disciples and which priests now offer: The offering of today is in
no way inferior to that which Christ offered, because it is not men
who sanctify the offering of today; it is the same Christ who
sanctified His own. For just as the words which God spoke are the
very same as those which the priest now speaks, so too the oblation
is the very same."[38]

<p>No one is unaware that the sacraments are the actions of Christ,
who administers them through men. Therefore, the sacraments are holy
in themselves, and by the power of Christ they pour grace into the
soul when they touch the body. The mind boggles at these different
ways in which Christ is present; they confront the Church with a
mystery ever to be pondered.

<p>But there is yet another manner in which Christ is present in
His Church, a manner which surpasses all the others; it is His
presence in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which is for this reason
"a more consoling source of devotion, a more lovely object of
contemplation, a more effective means of sanctification than all the
other sacraments."[39] The reason is clear; it contains Christ
Himself and it is "a kind of perfection of the spiritual life; in a
way, it is the goal of all the sacraments."[40]

<p>This presence is called "real" -- by which it is not intended to
exclude all other types of presence as if they could not be "real"
too, but because it is presence in the fullest sense: that is to
say, it is a substantial presence by which Christ, the God-Man, is
wholly and entirely present.[41] It would therefore be wrong to
explain this presence by having recourse to the "spiritual" nature,
as it is called, of the glorified Body of Christ, which is present
everywhere, or by reducing it to a kind of symbolism, as if this most
august Sacrament consisted of nothing else than an efficacious sign,
"of the spiritual presence of Christ and of His intimate union with
the faithful, members of His Mystical Body."[42]

<p>It is true that much can be found in the Fathers and in the
scholastics with regard to the symbolism of the Eucharist, especially
with reference to the unity of the Church. The Council of Trent,
restating their doctrine, taught that the Savior bequeathed the
blessed Eucharist to His Church "as a symbol . . . of that unity and
charity with which He wished all Christians to be most intimately
united among themselves," and hence "as a symbol of that One Body of
which He is the Head."[43]

<p>When Christian literature was still in its infancy, the unknown
author of that work we know as the Didache or Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles" wrote as follows on this subject: "In regard to the
Eucharist, give thanks in this manner: . . . just as this bread was
scattered and dispersed over the hills, but when harvested was made
one, so may Your Church be gathered into Your kingdom from the ends
of the earth."[44]

<p>The same we read in St. Cyprian, writing in defense of the
Church against schism: "Finally, the sacrifices of the Lord proclaim
the unity of Christians, bound together by the bond of a firm and
inviolable charity. For when the Lord, in speaking of bread which is
produced by the compacting of many grains of wheat, refers to it as
His Body, He is describing our people whose unity He has sustained,
and when He refers to wine pressed from many grapes and berries, as
His Blood, He is speaking of our flock, formed by the fusing of many
united together."[45]

<p>But before all of these, St. Paul had written to the
Corinthians: the one bread makes us one body, though we are many in
number the same bread is shared by all.[46]

<p>While the eucharistic symbolism brings us to an understanding of
the effect proper to this Sacrament, which is the unity of the
mystical Body, it does not indicate or explain what it is that makes
this Sacrament different from all others. The constant teaching
which the Catholic Church passes on to her catechumens, the
understanding of the Christian people, the doctrine defined by the
Council of Trent, the very words used by Christ when He instituted
the Most Holy Eucharist, compel us to acknowledge that "the Eucharist
is that flesh of Our Savior Jesus Christ who suffered for our sins
and whom the Father in His loving-kindness raised again."[47] To
these words of St. Ignatius of Antioch, we may add those which
Theodore of Mopsueta, a faithful witness to the faith of the Church n
this point, addressed to the faithful: "The Lord did not say: This
is a symbol of My Body, and this is a symbol of My blood but: This
is My Body and My Blood." He teaches us not to look to the nature of
those things which lie before us and are perceived by the senses, for
by the prayer of thanksgiving and the words spoken over them, they
have been changed into Flesh and Blood."[48]

<p>The Council of Trent, basing itself on this faith of the Church,
"openly and sincerely professes that within the Holy Sacrament of the
Eucharist, after the Consecration of the bread and wine, Our Lord
Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, really, truly and substantially
contained under those outward appearances." In this way, the Savior
in His humanity is present not only at the right hand of the Father
according to the natural manner of existence, but also in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist "by a mode of existence which we cannot
express in words, but which, with a mind illumined by faith, we can
conceive, and must most firmly believe, to be possible to God."[49]

<p align=center><b>CHRIST OUR LORD IS PRESENT IN THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST BY TRANSUBSTANTIATION</b></p>

<p>To avoid misunderstanding this sacramental presence which
surpasses the laws of nature and constitutes the greatest miracle of
its kind[50] we must listen with docility to the voice of the
teaching and praying Church. This voice, which constantly echoes the
voice of Christ, assures us that the way Christ is made present in
this Sacrament is none other than by the change of the whole
substance of the bread into His Body, and of the whole substance of
the wine into His Blood, and that this unique and truly wonderful
change the Catholic Church rightly calls transubstantiation.[51] As
a result of transubstantiation, the species of bread and wine
undoubtedly take on a new meaning and a new finality, for they no
longer remain ordinary bread and ordinary wine, but become the sign
of something sacred, the sign of a spiritual food. However, the
reason they take on this new significance and this new finality is
simply because they contain a new "reality" which we may justly term
ontological. Not that there lies under those species what was
already there before,, but something quite different; and that not
only because of the faith of the Church, but in objective reality,
since after the change of the substance or nature of the bread and
wine into the Body and Blood of Christ, nothing remains of the bread
and wine but the appearances under which Christ, whole and entire, in
His physical "reality" is bodily present, although not in the same
way that bodies are present in a given place.

<p>For this reason the Fathers took special care to warn the
faithful that in reflecting on this most august Sacrament, they
should not trust to their senses, which reach only the properties of
bread and wine, but rather to the words of Christ which have power to
transform, change and transmute the bread and wine into His Body and
Blood. For, as those same Fathers often said, the power that
accomplishes this is that same power by which God Almighty, at the
beginning of time, created the world out of nothing.

<p>"We have been instructed in these matters and filled with an
unshakable faith," says St. Cyril of Alexandria, at the end of a
sermon on the mysteries of the faith, "that that which seems to be
bread, is not bread, though it tastes like it, but the Body of
Christ, and that which seems to be wine, is not wine, though it too
tastes as such, but the Blood of Christ . . . draw inner strength by
receiving this bread as spiritual food and your soul will
rejoice."[52]

<p>St. John Chrysostom emphasizes this point, saying: "It is not
the power of man which makes what is put before us the Body and Blood
of Christ, but the power of Christ Himself who was crucified for us.
The priest standing there in the place of Christ says these words but
their power and grace are from God. 'This is My Body,' he says, and
these words transform what lies before him."[53]

<p>Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, is in full agreement with the
Bishop of Constantinople when he writes in his commentary on the
Gospel of St. Matthew: "Christ said indicating (the bread and wine):
'This is My Body,' and "This is My Blood," in order that you might
not judge what you see to be a mere figure. The offerings, by the
hidden power of God Almighty, are changed into Christ's Body and
Blood, and by receiving these we come to share in the life-giving and
sanctifying efficacy of Christ."[54]

<p>Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, dealing with the Eucharistic change,
says: "Let us be assured that this is not what nature formed, but
what the blessing consecrated, and that greater efficacy resides in
the blessing than in nature, for by the blessing nature is changed."
To confirm the truth of this mystery, he recounts many of the
miracles described in the Scriptures, including Christ's birth of the
Virgin Mary, and then turning to the work of creation, concludes
thus: "Surely the word of Christ, which could make out of nothing
that which did not exist, can change things already in existence into
what they were not. For it is no less extraordinary to give things
new natures than to change their natures."[55]

<p>However, there is no need to assemble many testimonies. Rather
let us recall that firmness of faith with which the Church with one
accord opposed Berengarius, who, yielding to the difficulties of
human reasoning, was the first who denied the Eucharistic change.
More than once she threatened to condemn him unless he retracted.
Thus it was that our predecessor, St. Gregory VII, ordered him to
pronounce the following oath:

<p>"I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and
wine which are placed upon the altar are, by the mystery of the
sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer, substantially changed
into the true and life-giving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ Our
Lord, and that after the Consecration, there is present the true Body
of Christ which was born of the Virgin and, offered up for the
salvation of the world, hung on the Cross and now sits at the right
hand of the Father, and that there is present the true Blood of
Christ which flowed from His side. They are present not only by
means of a sign and of the efficacy of the Sacrament, but also in the
very reality and truth of their nature and substance."[56]

<p>These words fully accord with the doctrine of the mystery of the
Eucharistic change as set forth by the ecumenical councils. The
constant teaching of these councils -- of the Lateran, of Constance,
Florence and Trent -- whether stating the teaching of the Church or
condemning errors, affords us an admirable example of the
unchangingness of the Catholic Faith.

<p>After the Council of Trent, our predecessor, Pius VI, on the
occasion of the errors of the Synod of Pistoia, warned parish priests
when carrying out their office of teaching, not to neglect to speak
of transubstantiation, one of the articles of faith.[57] Similarly
our predecessor of happy memory, Pius XII, recalled the bounds which
those who undertake to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation
might not cross.[58] We ourself also, in fulfillment of our apostolic
office, have openly borne solemn witness to the faith of the Church
at the National Eucharistic Congress held recently at Pisa.[59]

<p>Moreover the Catholic Church has held on to this faith in the
presence in the Eucharist of the Body and Blood of Christ, not only
in her teaching but also in her practice, since she has at all times
given to this great Sacrament the worship which is known as Latria
and which may be given to God alone. As St. Augustine says: "It was
in His flesh that Christ walked among us and it is His flesh that He
has given us to eat for our salvation. No one, however, eats of this
without having first adored it . . . and not only do we not sin in
thus adoring it, but we would sin if we did not do so."[60]

<p align=center><b>LATREUTIC WORSHIP OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST</b></p>

<p>The Catholic Church has always offered and still offers the cult
of Latria to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, not only during Mass,
but also outside of it, reserving Consecrated Hosts with the utmost
care, exposing them to solemn veneration, and carrying them
processionally to the joy of great crowds of the faithful.

<p>In the ancient documents of the Church we have many testimonies
of this veneration. The pastors of the Church in fact, solicitously
exhorted the faithful to take the greatest care in keeping the
Eucharist which they took to their homes. "The Body of Christ is
meant to be eaten, not to be treated with irreverence," St.
Hippolytus warns the faithful[61]

<p>In fact the faithful thought themselves guilty, and rightly so,
as Origen recalls, if after they received the Body of the Lord in
order to preserve it with all care and reverence, a small fragment of
it fell off through negligence.[62]

<p>The same pastors severely reproved those who showed lack of
reverence if it happened. This is attested to by Novitianus whose
testimony in the matter is trustworthy. He judged as deserving
condemnation any one who came out of Sunday service carrying with him
as usual the Eucharist, the sacred Body of the Lord, "not going to
his house but running to places of amusement."[63]

<p>On the other hand St. Cyril of Alexandria rejects as folly the
opinion of those who maintained that if a part of the Eucharist was
left over for the following day it did not confer sanctification.
"For," he says, "neither Christ is altered nor His Holy Body changed,
but the force and power and vivifying grace always remain with
it."[64]

<p>Nor should we forget that in ancient times the faithful,
harassed by the violence of persecution or living in solitude out of
love for monastic life nourished themselves even daily, receiving
Holy Communion by their own hands when the priest or deacon was
absent.[65]

<p>We say this not in order that there may be some change in the
way of keeping the Eucharist and of receiving Holy Communion which
was later on prescribed by Church laws and which now remain in force,
but rather that we may rejoice over the faith of the Church which is
always one and the same.

<p>This faith also gave rise to the feast of Corpus Christi which
was first celebrated in the diocese of Liege specially through the
efforts of the servant of God, Blessed Juliana of Mount Cornelius,
and which our predecessor Urban IV extended to the Universal Church.
>From it have originated many practices of Eucharistic piety which
under the inspiration of divine grace have increased from day to day
and with which the Catholic Church is striving ever more to do homage
to Christ, to thank Him for so great a gift and to implore His mercy.

<p align=center><b>EXHORTATION TO PROMOTE THE CULT OF THE EUCHARIST</b></p>

<p>We therefore ask you, venerable brothers, among the people
entrusted to your care and vigilance, to preserve this faith in its
purity and integrity -- a faith which seeks only to remain perfectly
loyal to the word of Christ and of the Apostles and unambiguously
rejects all erroneous and mischievous opinions. Tirelessly promote
the cult of the Eucharist, the focus where all other forms of piety
must ultimately emerge.

<p>May the faithful, thanks to your efforts, come to realize and
experience ever more perfectly the truth of these words: "he who
desires life finds here a place to live in and the means to live by.
Let him approach, let him believe, let him be incorporated so that he
may receive life. Let him not refuse union with the members, let him
not be a corrupt member, deserving to be cut off, nor a disfigured
member to be ashamed of. Let him be a grateful, fitting and healthy
member. Let him cleave to the body, let him live by God and for God.
Let him now labor here on earth, that he may afterwards reign in
heaven."[66]

<p>It is to be desired that the faithful, every day and in great
numbers, actively participate in the Sacrifice of the Mass, receive
Holy Communion with a pure heart, and give thanks to Christ our Lord
for so great a gift. Let them remember these words: "The desire of
Jesus Christ and of the Church that all the faithful receive daily
Communion means above all that through the sacramental union with God
they may obtain the strength necessary for mastering their passions,
for purifying themselves of their daily venial faults and for
avoiding the grave sins to which human frailty is exposed."[67]

<p>In the course of the day the faithful should not omit to visit
the Blessed Sacrament, which according to the liturgical laws must be
kept in the churches with great reverence in a most honorable
location. Such visits are a proof of gratitude, an expression of
love, an acknowledgment of the Lord's presence.

<p>No on can fail to understand that the Divine Eucharist bestows
upon the Christian people an incomparable dignity. Not only while
the sacrifice is offered and the sacrament is received, but as long
as the Eucharist is kept in our churches and oratories, Christ is
truly the Emmanuel, that is, "God with us." Day and night He is in
our midst, he dwells with us, full of grace and truth.[68] He
restores morality, nourishes virtues, consoles the afflicted,
strengthens the weak. He proposes His own example to those who come
to Him that all may learn to be, like Himself, meek and humble of
heart and to seek not their own interests but those of God.

<p>Anyone who approaches this august Sacrament with special
devotion and endeavors to return generous love for Christ's own
infinite love, will experience and fully understand -- not without
spiritual joy and fruit -- how precious is the life hidden with Christ
in God[69] and how great is the value of converse with Christ, for
there is nothing more consoling on earth, nothing more efficacious
for advancing along the road of holiness.

<p>Further, you realize, venerable brothers, that the Eucharist is
reserved in the churches and oratories as in the spiritual center of
a religious community or of a parish, yes, of the universal Church
and of all of humanity, since beneath the appearance of the species,
Christ is contained, the invisible Head of the Church, the Redeemer
of the World, the Center of all hearts, "by whom all things are and
by whom we exist."[70]

<p>From this it follows that the worship paid to the Divine
Eucharist strongly impels the soul to cultivate a "social" love,[71]
by which the common good is given preference over the good of the
individual. Let us consider as our own the interests of the
community, of the parish, of the entire Church, extending our charity
to the whole world, because we know that everywhere there are members
of Christ.

<p>The Eucharistic Sacrament, venerable brothers, is the sign and
the cause of the unity of the Mystical Body, and it inspires an
active "ecclesial" spirit in those who venerate it with great fervor.
Therefore, never cease to persuade those committed to your care that
they should learn to make their own the cause of the Church, in
approaching the eucharistic mystery to pray to God without
interruption to offer themselves to God as a pleasing sacrifice for
the peace and unity of the Church, so that all the children of the
Church be united and think the same, that there be no divisions among
them, but rather unity of mind and purpose, as the Apostles
insists.[72] May all those not yet in perfect communion with the
Catholic Church, who though separated from her glory in the name of
Christian, share with us as soon as possible with the help of divine
grace that unity of faith and communion which Christ wanted to be the
distinctive mark of His disciples.

<p>This zeal in praying and consecrating one's self to God for the
unity of the Church should be practiced particularly by religious,
both men and women, inasmuch as they are in a special way devoted to
the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, according it homage and honor
on earth, in virtue of their vows.

<p>Nothing has ever been or is more important to the Church or more
consoling than the desire for the unity of all Christians, a desire
which we wish to express once again in the very words used by the
Council of Trent at the close of its decree on the Most Blessed
Eucharist: "In conclusion, the sacred synod with paternal love
admonishes, exhorts, prays and implores 'through the merciful
kindness of our God'[73] that each and every Christian come at last
to a perfect agreement regarding this sign of unity, this bond of
charity, this symbol of concord, and, mindful of such great dignity
and such exquisite love of Christ Our Lord who gave His beloved soul
as the price of our salvation and 'his flesh to eat'[74] believe and
adore these sacred mysteries of His Body and Blood with such firm and
unwavering faith, with such devotion, piety and veneration, that they
can receive frequently that super-substantial bread,[75] which will
be for them truly the life of the soul and unfailing strength of
mind, so that fortified by its vigor[76] they can depart from this
wretched pilgrimage on earth to reach their heavenly home where they
will then eat the same 'bread of angels'[77] no longer hidden by the
species which now they eat under the sacred appearances."[78]

<p>May the all-good Redeemer who shortly before His death prayed to
the Father that all who were to believe in Him would be one even as
He and the Father were one,[79] deign speedily to hear our most
ardent prayer and that of the entire Church, that we may all with one
voice and one faith, celebrate the Eucharistic Mystery and, by
participating in the Body of Christ, become one body,[80] linked by
those same bonds which He Himself desire for its perfection.

<p>And we turn with paternal affection also to those who belong to
the venerable Churches of the Orient, from which came so many most
illustrious Fathers whose testimony to the belief of the Eucharist we
have so gladly cited in our present letter. Our soul is filled with
intense joy as we consider your faith in the Eucharist, which is also
our faith, and as we listen to the liturgical prayers by which you
celebrate so great a mystery we rejoice to behold your eucharistic
devotion, and to read your theologians explaining or defending the
doctrine of this most august Sacrament.

<p>May the Most Blessed Virgin Mary from whom Christ Our Lord took
the flesh which under the species of bread and wine "is contained,
offered and consumed,"[81] may all the saints of God, specially those
who burned with a more ardent devotion to the Divine Eucharist,
intercede before the Father of mercies so that from this same faith
in and devotion toward the Eucharist may result and flourish a
perfect unity of communion among all Christians.

<p>Unforgettable are the words of the holy martyr Ignatius, in his
warning to the faithful of Philadelphia against the evils of division
and schism, the remedy for which lies in the Eucharist: "Strive
then," he said, "to make use of one form of thanksgiving for the
flesh of Our Lord Jesus Christ is one and one is the chalice in the
union of His Blood, one altar, one bishop."[82]

<p>Encouraged by the most consoling hope of the blessings which
will accrue to the whole Church and the entire world from an increase
in devotion to the Eucharist, with profound affection we impart to
you, venerable brothers, to the priests, Religious and all those who
collaborate with you and to all the faithful entrusted in your care,
the apostolic benediction as a pledge of heavenly graces.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, the third day of September, the
Feast of St. Pius X, in the year 1965, the third year of our
pontificate.
