<h1>Notification on Vassula Ryden</h1>  
<p><b>Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith<br>October 6, 1995</b>

<p>MANY BISHOPS, PRIESTS, RELIGIOUS AND LAY PEOPLE have sought an authoritative
judgement from this Congregation on the activity of Mrs. Vassula Ryden, a Greek
Orthodox residing in Switzerland, who in speech and in writing is spreading in
Catholic circles throughout the world messages attributed to alleged heavenly
revelations.

<p>A calm, attentive examination of the entire question, undertaken by this Congregation
in order to "test the spirits to see whether they are of God" (cf. 1 Jn 4:1), has brought
out -- in addition to positive aspects -- a number of basic elements that must be considered
negative in the light of Catholic doctrine.

<p>In addition to pointing out the suspect nature of the ways in which these alleged
revelations have occurred, it is necessary to underscore several doctrinal errors they
contain.

<p>Among other things, ambiguous language is used in speaking of the Persons of the
Holy Trinity, to the point of confusing the specific names and functions of the Divine
Persons. These alleged revelations predict an imminent period when the Antichrist will
prevail in the Church. In millenarian style, it is prophesied that God is going to make a
final glorious intervention which will initiate on earth, even before Christ's definitive
coming, an era of peace and universal prosperity. Furthermore, the proximate arrival is
foretold of a Church which would be a kind of pan-Christian community, contrary to
Catholic doctrine.

<p>The fact that the aforementioned errors no longer appear in Ryden's later writings is a
sign that the alleged "heavenly messages" are merely the result of private meditations.

<p>Moreover, by habitually sharing in the sacraments of the Catholic Church even though
she is Greek Orthodox, Mrs. Ryden is causing considerable surprise in various circles of
the Catholic Church. She appears to be putting herself above all ecclesiastical
jurisdiction and every canonical norm, and in effect, is creating an ecumenical disorder
that irritates many authorities, ministers and faithful of her own Church, as she puts
herself outside the ecclesiastical discipline of the latter.

<p>Given the negative effect of Vassula Ryden's activities, despite some positive aspects,
this Congregation requests the intervention of the Bishops so that their faithful may be
suitably informed and that no opportunity may be provided in their Dioceses for the
dissemination of her ideas. Lastly, the Congregation invites all the faithful not to regard
Mrs. Vassula Ryden's writings and speeches as supernatural and to preserve the purity
of the faith that the Lord has entrusted to the Church.
