<h1>On "The Many Faces of AIDS"</h1>  
<p><b>Letter to Archbishop Pio Laghi
<br>Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger
<br>May 29, 1988</b>

<p>THE LIVELY DISCUSSION, widened and sometimes distorted by the press
worldwide, which followed the publication of the NCCB Administrative
Board's well-known document, "The Many Faces of AIDS," and in which were
involved distinguished representatives of the episcopate, has generated
in many of the faithful, and not only in the United States, a good deal of
confusion regarding the authentic Catholic position on the moral
problems involved. The Holy See wishes, therefore, to express its deep concern
that the unity so necessary among the bishops in the teaching of
Christian moral doctrine be clearly and publicly demonstrated.

<p>In the first
place, and on a more general level, one must keep in mind the problem posed by
the worldwide reaction which accompanies certain documents issued by
various episcopal conferences. This requires a particular sense of
responsibility and prudence in the choice of themes to be treated and in
the manner in which these statements are published, not to mention a
careful composition of the texts themselves. At least in some cases,
when the subjects under discussion are of interest to the universal church,
it would seem advisable to consult in advance with the Holy See.

<p>Secondly, regarding the precise moral issue in question here, I want to
draw attention to the clarification which appeared in the March 10
edition of <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i>, in an unsigned article entitled "Prevention of
AIDS: Christian Ethical Aspect," and I quote,

<blockquote>To seek a solution to the
problem of infection by promoting the use of prophylactics would be to
embark on a way not only insufficiently reliable from the technical
point of view, but also and above all, unacceptable from the moral aspect.
Such a proposal for 'safe' or at least 'safer' sex -- as they say -- ignores
the real cause of the problem, namely, the permissiveness which, in the area
of sex as in that related to other abuses, corrodes the moral fiber of
the people.
</blockquote>

In the case here under discussion, it hardly seems pertinent to appeal
to the classical principle of tolerance of the lesser evil on the part of
those who exercise responsibility for the temporal good of society. In
fact, even when the issue has to do with educational programs promoted
by the civil government, one would not be dealing simply with a form of
passive toleration but rather with a kind of behavior which would result
in at least the facilitation of evil.

<p>The problem of educational programs in specifically Catholic schools
and institutions requires particular attention. These facilities are called
to provide their own contribution for the prevention of AIDS, in full
fidelity to the moral doctrine of the church, without at the same time
engaging in compromises which may even give the impression of trying to
condone practices which are immoral, for example, technical instructions
in the use of prophylactic devices.

<p>In a society which seems increasingly to downgrade the value of
chastity, conjugal fidelity and temperance, and to be preoccupied sometimes
almost
exclusively with physical health and temporal well-being, the church's
responsibility is to give that kind of witness which is proper to her,
namely an unequivocal witness of effective and unreserved solidarity
with those who are suffering and, at the same time, a witness of defense of
the dignity of human sexuality which can only be realized within the context
of moral law. It is likewise crucial to note, as the board statement
does, that the only medically safe means of preventing AIDS are those
very types of behavior which conform to God's law and to the truth about man
which the church has always taught and today is still called
courageously to teach.

<p>I am confident that these considerations, which are known to His
Holiness and have his fullest support, will be welcomed by the cardinal and
bishop members of the conference and I wish to express my sincerest hope for a
successful conclusion of this important meeting of the entire episcopate
of the United States."

<p>Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger
<br>Prefect, Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
