<h1>Optatissima Pax</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on Prescribing Prayers for Peace
<br>His Holiness Pope Pius XII
<br>Promulgated on December 18, 1947</b>

<p><i>To the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Greeting and Apostolic Blessing.

<p>PEACE, LONGED FOR SO HOPEFULLY, which should signify the tranquillity of
order[1] and serene liberty,[2] even after the cruel experience of a long
war, still hangs in uncertain balance, as everyone must note with sadness
and alarm. Moreover, people's hearts and minds are kept in a state of
anxious suspense, while in not a few nations--already laid waste by the
world-conflict and its sorry aftermath of ruin and distress--the social
classes are being incited to mutual hatred as their continuous rioting
and agitation plainly threaten to subvert the very foundations of civil
society.

<p>2. With this scene of disaster and misery before Us, Our heart is heavy
with the weight of bitter sorrow and We cannot but feel compelled, by
reason of the charge of universal fatherhood which God has laid upon Us,
not only to entreat the nations one and all to have done with rancor and
make peace once more as friends, but also to urge all Our children in
Christ to storm heaven with more fervent prayers, never forgetting that
all efforts are inadequate and unavailing if God's good pleasure is not
first obtained, according to the inspired words of the Psalmist: "unless
the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it."[3]

<p>3. The crisis is most serious indeed. Remedies must be found, and found
without further delay. On the one hand the economic system of many
nations, as a result of fabulous military expenditures and enormous
destruction wrought by the war, has been dislocated and weakened to such
an extent as to be powerless to meet the problems with which it is faced,
and to provide the materials for appropriate constructive enterprise,
where work might be available for the unemployed who now must live their
lives in forced and fruitless idleness. On the other hand there is no
lack of those who, sad to say, embitter and exploit the working man in
his distress, following a secret and astute plan, and thus abstruct the
heroic efforts which the forces of justice and order are making to
rebuild scattered fortunes.

<p>4. But everyone must come to realize that lost wealth will not be
recovered, or present
wealth secured, by discord, public tumult, fratricide. This result can be
achieved only by working together in harmony, by cooperation, by peaceful
labor.

<p>5. Those who deliberately and rashly plan to incite the masses to tumult,
sedition, or infringement of the liberty of others are certainly not
helping to relieve the poverty of the people but are rather increasing it
by fomenting mutual hatred and disturbing the established order; this can
even lead to complete chaos. Factional strife "has been and will be to
many nations a greater calamity than war itself, than famine or
disease."[4]

<p>6. At the same time it is the duty of all to realize that the world
crisis is so serious today and so menacing for the future that it is
imperative for all, especially the rich, to place the common welfare
above their private advantage and profits.

<p>7. But it must be clearly and constantly borne in mind that the first and
most urgent need is to reconcile the hearts of men, to bring them to
fraternal agreement and cooperation, so that they may set to work upon
plans and projects in keeping with the demands of Christian teaching and
needs of the present situation.

<p>8. Let all remember that the flood of evil and disaster that has
over-taken the world in past years was due chiefly to the fact that the
divine religion of Jesus Christ, that provider of mutual charity among
citizens, peoples and nations, did not govern, as it should, private,
domestic and public life. If things have gone wrong on account of the
desertion from Christ, public and private life must return to Him as soon
as possible: if error has clouded the minds of men, they must return to
that truth which, revealed from on high, indicates the right way to
heaven: if hatred has brought them fatal results, they must return to
Christian love which alone can heal their many wounds, and carry them
over the crisis so filled with danger.

<p>9. At the approach of the consoling feast of Christmas, which recalls the
Child Jesus in the cradle and the choir of Angels singing peace to men,
We think it opportune to exhort all Christians, especially those in the
flower of youth, to crowd around the holy crib and there to pray the
Divine Infant to be pleased to ward off the threats of impending
struggles and to quench the torches of revolt. May He illumine with light
from above minds which are less often moved by stubborn malice than
deceived by errors under the semblance of truth; may He repress and
soothe rancor in men's minds, compose discords and give new life and
vigor to Christian charity. May He teach those who are wealthy,
generosity to the poor, and may He console by His example and aid from on
high those who are in need and distress and lead them to desire above all
those heavenly gifts which are more precious and lasting .

<p>10. During the present difficulties, We place much trust in the prayers
of innocent children for whom the Divine Redeemer cherishes a special
love. Particularly during Christmas time, let them raise to Him their
limpid voices and tiny hands, tokens of interior innocence, in united
prayer, imploring peace, harmony and mutual charity. To their fervent
prayers, We desire them to add the works of Christian piety and those
gifts of Christian generosity which may placate the Divine Justice
offended by so many crimes, and, as their means allow, bring relief to
the needy.

<p>11. We are confident, Venerable Brethren, that your prompt and zealous
action will insure a hearty response to Our paternal exhortation, and
that all, especially the young, will answer with enthusiasm this appeal
which you will make your own.

<p>12. Relying on this hope, to each and all of you, Venerable Brethren, as
well as the flocks confided to your care, We impart with overflowing
heart the Apostolic Benediction, a testimony of Our fatherly affection
and a pledge of heavenly graces.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, the 18th day of December in the year 1947
and the ninth of Our Pontificate.
