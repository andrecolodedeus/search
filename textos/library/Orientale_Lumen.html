<h1>Orientale Lumen</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Letter on the Eastern Churches
<br>His Holiness Pope John Paul II
<br>Promulgated on May 2, 1995</b>

<p>Venerable Brothers, Dear Sons and Daughters of the Church,

<p>THE LIGHT OF THE EAST has illumined the universal Church, from the
moment when "a rising sun" appeared above us (Lk 1:78): Jesus Christ,
our Lord whom all Christians invoke as the Redeemer of man and the
hope of the world.

<p>That light inspired my predecessor Pope Leo XIII to write the
Apostolic Letter <i>Orientalium Dignitas</i> in which he sought to
safeguard the significance of the Eastern traditions for the whole
Church. [1]

<p>On the centenary of that event and of the initiatives the Pontiff
intended at that time as an aid to restoring unity with all the
Christians of the East, I wish to send to the Catholic Church a
similar appeal, which has been enriched by the knowledge and
interchange which has taken place over the past century.

<p>Since, in fact, we believe that the venerable and ancient tradition
of the Eastern Churches is an integral part of the heritage of
Christ's Church, the first need for Catholics is to be familiar with
that tradition, so as to be nourished by it and to encourage the
process of unity in the best way possible for each.

<p>Our Eastern Catholic brothers and sisters are very conscious of being
the living bearers of this tradition, together with our Orthodox
brothers and sisters. The members of the Catholic Church of the Latin
tradition must also be fully acquainted with this treasure and thus
feel, with the Pope, a passionate longing that the full manifestation
of the Church's catholicity be restored to the Church and to the
world, expressed not by a single tradition, and still less by one
community in opposition to the other; and that we too may all be
granted a full taste of the divinely revealed and undivided heritage
of the universal Church [2] which is preserved and grows in the life
of the Churches of the East as in those of the West.

<p>2. My gaze turns to the <i>Orientale Lumen</i> which shines from Jerusalem
(cf. Is 60:1; Rv 21:10), the city where the Word of God, made man for
our salvation, a Jew "descended from David according to the flesh"
(Rom 1:3, 2 Tm 2:8), died and rose again. In that holy city, when the
day of Pentecost had come and "they were all together in one place"
(Acts 2:1), the Paraclete was sent upon Mary and the disciples. From
there the Good News spread throughout the world because, filled with
the Holy Spirit, "they spoke the word of God with boldness" (Acts
4:31). From there, from the mother of all the Churches, [3] the Gospel
was preached to all nations, many of which boast of having had one of
the Apostles as their first witness to the Lord. [4] In that city the
most varied cultures and traditions were welcomed in the name of the
one God (cf. Acts 2:9-11). In turning to it with nostalgia and
gratitude, we find the strength and enthusiasm to intensify the quest
for harmony in that genuine plurality of forms which remains the
Church's ideal. [5]

<p>3. A Pope, son of a Slav people, is particularly moved by the call of
those peoples to whom the two saintly brothers Cyril and Methodius
went. They were a glorious example of apostles of unity who were able
to proclaim Christ in their search for communion between East and
West amid the difficulties which sometimes set the two worlds against
one another. Several times I have reflected on the example of their
activity, [6] also addressing those who are their children in faith
and culture.

<p>These considerations now need to be broadened so as to embrace all
the Eastern Churches, in the variety of their different traditions.
My thoughts turn to our brothers and sisters of the Eastern Churches,
in the wish that together we may seek the strength of an answer to
the questions man is asking today in every part of the world. I
intend to address their heritage of faith and life, aware that there
can be no second thoughts about pursuing the path of unity, which is
irreversible as the Lord's appeal for unity is irreversible. "Dearly
beloved, we have this common task: we must say together from East and
West: <i>Ne evacuetur Crux</i>! (cf. 1 Cor 1:17). The Cross of Christ must
not be emptied of its power because if the Cross of Christ is emptied
of its power, man no longer has roots, he no longer has prospects he
is destroyed! This is the cry of the end of the 20th century. It is
the cry of Rome, of Moscow, of Constantinople. It is the cry of all
Christendom: of the Americas, of Africa, of Asia, of everyone. It is
the cry of the new evangelization." [7]

<p>I am thinking of the Eastern Churches, as did many other Popes in the
past, aware that the mandate to preserve the Church's unity and to
seek Christian unity tirelessly wherever it was wounded was addressed
to them. A particularly close link already binds us. We have almost
everything in common; [8] and above all, we have in common the true
longing for unity.

<p>4. The cry of men and women today seeking meaning for their lives
reaches all the Churches of the East and of the West. In this cry, we
perceive the invocation of those who seek the Father whom they have
forgotten and lost (cf. Lk 15:18-20; Jn 14:8). The women and men of
today are asking us to show them Christ, who knows the Father and who
has revealed him (cf. Jn 8:55; 14:8-11). Letting the world ask us its
questions, listening with humility and tenderness, in full solidarity
with those who express them, we are called to show in word and deed
today the immense riches that our Churches preserve in the coffers of
their traditions. We learn from the Lord himself, who would stop
along the way to be with the people, who listened to them and was
moved to pity when he saw them "like sheep without a shepherd" (Mt
9:36; cf. Mk 6:34). From him we must learn the loving gaze with which
he reconciled men with the Father and with themselves, communicating
to them that power which alone is able to heal the whole person.

<p>This appeal calls on the Churches of the East and the West to
concentrate on the essential: "We cannot come before Christ, the Lord
of history, as divided as we have unfortunately been in the course of
the second millennium. These divisions must give way to
<i>rapprochement</i> and harmony; the wounds on the path of Christian
unity must be healed." [9]

<p>Going beyond our own frailties, we must turn to him, the one Teacher,
sharing in his death so as to purify ourselves from that jealous
attachment to feelings and memories, not of the great things God has
done for us, but of the human affairs of a past that still weighs
heavily on our hearts. May the Spirit clarify our gaze so that
together we may reach out to contemporary man who is waiting for the
good news. If we make a harmonious, illuminating, life-giving
response to the world's expectations and sufferings, we will truly
contribute to a more effective proclamation of the Gospel among the
people of our time.

<p><b>Knowing the Christian East: An experience of faith</b>

<p>5. "In the study of revealed truth East and West have used different
methods and approaches in understanding and confessing divine things.
It is hardly surprising, then, if sometimes one tradition has come
nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of
revelation than the other, or has expressed them better. In such
cases, these various theological formulations are often to be
considered complementary rather than conflicting." [10]

<p>Pondering over the questions, aspirations and experiences I have
mentioned, my thoughts turn to the Christian heritage of the East. I
do not intend to describe that heritage or to interpret it: I listen
to the Churches of the East, which I know are living interpreters of
the treasure of tradition they preserve. In contemplating it, before
my eyes appear elements of great significance for a fuller and more
thorough understanding of the Christian experience. These elements
are capable of giving a more complete Christian response to the
expectations of the men and women of today. Indeed, in comparison to
any other culture, the Christian East has a unique and privileged
role as the original setting where the Church was born.

<p>The Christian tradition of the East implies a way of accepting,
understanding and living faith in the Lord Jesus. In this sense it is
extremely close to the Christian tradition of the West, which is born
of and nourished by the same faith. Yet it is legitimately and
admirably distinguished from the latter, since Eastern Christians
have their own way of perceiving and understanding, and thus an
original way of living their relationship with the Saviour. Here,
with respect and trepidation, I want to approach the act of worship
which these Churches express, rather than to identify this or that
specific theological point which has emerged down the centuries in
the polemical debates between East and West.

<p>From the beginning, the Christian East has proved to contain a wealth
of forms capable of assuming the characteristic features of each
individual culture, with supreme respect for each particular
community. We can only thank God with deep emotion for the wonderful
variety with which he has allowed such a rich and composite mosaic of
different tesserae to be formed.

<p>6. Certain features of the spiritual and theological tradition,
common to the various Churches of the East mark their sensitivity to
the forms taken by the transmission of the Gospel in Western lands.
The Second Vatican Council summarized them as follows: "Everyone
knows with what love the Eastern Christians celebrate the sacred
liturgy, especially the Eucharistic mystery, source of the Church's
life and pledge of future glory. In this mystery the faithful, united
with their Bishops, have access to God the Father through the Son,
the Word made flesh who suffered and was glorified, in the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit. And so made 'sharers of the divine nature' (2 Pt
1:4) they enter into communion with the most holy Trinity." [11]

<p>These features describe the Eastern outlook of the Christian. His or
her goal is participation in the divine nature through communion with
the mystery of the Holy Trinity. In this view the Father's "monarchy"
is outlined as well as the concept of salvation according to the
divine plan, as it is presented by Eastern theology after Saint
Irenaeus of Lyons and which spread among the Cappadocian Fathers. [12]

<p>Participation in Trinitarian life takes place through the liturgy and
in a special way through the Eucharist, the mystery of communion with
the glorified body of Christ, the seed of innmortality. [13] In
divinization and particularly in the sacraments, Eastern theology
attributes a very special role to the Holy Spirit: through the power
of the Spirit who dwells in man deification already begins on earth;
the creature is transfigured and God's kingdom inaugurated.

<p>The teaching of the Cappadocian Fathers on divinization passed into
the tradition of all the Eastern Churches and is part of their common
heritage. This can be summarized in the thought already expressed by
Saint Irenaeus at the end of the second century: God passed into man
so that man might pass over to God. [14] This theology of divinization
remains one of the achievements particularly dear to Eastern
Christian thought. [15]

<p>On this path of divinization, those who have been made "most
Christ-like" by grace and by commitment to the way of goodness go
before us: the martyrs and the saints. [16] And the Virgin Mary
occupies an altogether special place among them. From her the shoot
of Jesse sprang (cf. Is 11:1). Her figure is not only the Mother who
waits for us, but the Most Pure who--the fulfillment of so many Old
Testament prefigurations--is an icon of the Church, the symbol and
anticipation of humanity transfigured by grace the model and the
unfailing hope for all those who direct their steps towards the
heavenly Jerusalem. [17]

<p>Although strongly emphasizing Trinitarian realism and its unfolding
in sacramental life, the East associates faith in the unity of the
divine nature with the fact that the divine essence is unknowable.
The Eastern Fathers always assert that it is impossible to know what
God is, one can only know that he is, since he revealed himself in
the history of salvation as Father Son and Holy Spirit. [18]

<p>This sense of the inexpressible divine reality is reflected in
liturgical celebration, where the sense of mystery is so strongly
felt by all the faithful of the Christian East.

<p>"Moreover in the East are to be found the riches of those spiritual
traditions which are given expression in monastic life especially.
From the glorious times of the holy Fathers that monastic
spirituality flourished in the East which later flowed over into the
Western world, and there provided a source from which Latin monastic
life took its rise and has often drawn fresh vigour ever since.
Therefore, it is earnestly recommended that Catholics avail
themselves more often of the spiritual riches of the Eastern Fathers
which lift up the whole man to the contemplation of the divine
mysteries." [19]

<p><b>Gospel, Churches and Culture</b>

<p>7. As I have pointed out at other times, one of the first great
values embodied particularly in the Christian East is the attention
given to peoples and their cultures so that the Word of God and his
praise may resound in every language. I reflected on this topic in
the Encyclical Letter <i>Slavorum Apostoli</i>, where I noted that Cyril
and Methodius "desired to become similar in every aspect to those to
whom they were bringing the Gospel, they wished to become a part of
those peoples and to share their lot in everything", [20] "it was a
question of a new method of catechesis." [21] In doing this, they
expressed an attitude widespread in the Christian East: "By
incarnating the Gospel in the native culture of the peoples which
they were evangelizing, Saints Cyril and Methodius were especially
meritorious for the formation and development of that same culture,
or rather of many cultures." [22] They combined respect and
consideration for individual cultures with a passion for the
universality of the Church which they tirelessly strove to achieve.
The attitude of the two brothers from Thessalonica is representative
in Christian antiquity of a style typical of many Churches:
revelation is proclaimed satisfactorily and becomes fully
understandable when Christ speaks the tongues of the various peoples,
and they can read Scripture and sing the liturgy in their own
language with their own expressions, as though repeating the marvels
of Pentecost.

<p>At a time when it is increasingly recognized that the right of every
people to express themselves according to their own heritage of
culture and thought is fundamental, the experience of the individual
Churches of the East is offered to us as an authoritative example of
successful inculturation.

<p>From this model we learn that if we wish to avoid the recurrence of
particularism as well as of exaggerated nationalism, we must realize
that the proclamation of the Gospel should be deeply rooted in what
is distinctive to each culture and open to convergence in a
universality which involves an exchange for the sake of mutual
enrichment.

<p><b>Between memory and expectation</b>

<p>8. Today we often feel ourselves prisoners of the present. It is as
though man had lost his perception of belonging to a history which
precedes and follows him. This effort to situate oneself between the
past and the future, with a grateful heart for the benefits received
and for those expected, is offered by the Eastern Churches in
particular, with a clear-cut sense of continuity which takes the name
of Tradition and of eschatological expectation.

<p><i>Tradition is the heritage of Christ's Church</i>. This is a living
memory of the Risen One met and witnessed to by the Apostles who
passed on his living memory to their successors in an uninterrupted
line, guaranteed by the apostolic succession through the laying on of
hands, down to the Bishops of today. This is articulated in the
historical and cultural patrimony of each Church, shaped by the
witness of the martyrs, fathers and saints, as well as by the living
faith of all Christians down the centuries to our own day. It is not
an unchanging repetition of formulas, but a heritage which preserves
its original, living kerygmatic core. It is Tradition that preserves
the Church from the danger of gathering only changing opinions, and
guarantees her certitude and continuity.

<p>When the uses and customs belonging to each Church are considered as
absolutely unchangeable there is a sure risk of Tradition losing that
feature of a living reality which grows and develops, and which the
Spirit guarantees precisely because it has something to say to the
people of every age. As Scripture is increasingly understood by those
who read it, [23] every other element of the Church's living heritage
is increasingly understood by believers and is enriched by new
contributions, in fidelity and in continuity. [24] Only a religious
assimilation, in the obedience of faith, of what the Church calls
"Tradition" will enable Tradition to be embodied in different
cultural and historical situations and conditions. [25] Tradition is
never pure nostalgia for things or forms past, nor regret for lost
privileges, but the living memory of the Bride, kept eternally
youthful by the Love that dwells within her.

<p>If Tradition puts us in continuity with the past, eschatological
expectation opens us to God's future. Each Church must struggle
against the temptation to make an absolute of what it does, and thus
to celebrate itself or abandon itself to sorrow. But time belongs to
God, and whatever takes place in time can never be identified with
the fullness of the Kingdom, which is always a free gift. The Lord
Jesus came to die for us and rose from the dead, while creation,
saved through hope, is still suffering its birth pangs (cf. Rom
8:22). The Lord himself will return to give the cosmos to the Father
(cf. 1 Cor 15:28). The Church invokes this return, and the monk and
the religious are its privileged witnesses.

<p>The East expresses in a living way the reality of tradition and
expectation. All its liturgy, in particular, is a commemoration of
salvation and an invocation of the Lord's return. And if Tradition
teaches the Churches fidelity to what gave birth to them,
eschatological expectation urges them to be what they have not yet
fully become, what the Lord wants them to become, and thus to seek
ever new ways of fidelity, overcoming pessimism because they are
striving for the hope of God who does not disappoint.

<p>We must show people the beauty of memory, the power that comes to us
from the Spirit and makes us witnesses because we are children of
witnesses; we must make them taste the wonderful things the Spirit
has wrought in history; we must show that it is precisely Tradition
which has preserved them, thus giving hope to those who, even without
seeing their efforts to do good crowned by success, know that someone
else will bring them to fulfillment; therefore man will feel less
alone, less enclosed in the narrow corner of his own individual
achievement.

<p><b>Monasticism as a model of baptismal life</b>

<p>9. I would now like to look at the vast panorama of Eastern
Christianity from a specific vantage point which affords a view of
many of its features: <i>monasticism.</i>

<p>In the East monasticism has retained great unity. It did not
experience the development of different kinds of apostolic life as in
the West. The various expressions of monastic life, from the strictly
coenobitic, as conceived by Pachomius or Basil, to the rigorously
eremitic, as with Anthony or Macanus of Egypt, correspond more to
different stages of the spiritual journey than to the choice between
different states of life. In any event, whatever form they take, they
are all based on monasticism.

<p>Moreover, in the East, monasticism was not seen merely as a separate
condition, proper to a precise category of Christians, but rather as
a reference point for all the baptized, according to the gifts
offered to each by the Lord; it was presented as a symbolic synthesis
of Christianity.

<p>When God's call is total, as it is in the monastic life, then the
person can reach the highest point that sensitivity, culture and
spirituality are able to express. This is even more true for the
Eastern Churches, for which monasticism was an essential experience
and still today is seen to flourish in them, once persecution is over
and hearts can be freely raised to heaven. The monastery is the
prophetic place where creation becomes praise of God and the precept
of concretely lived charity becomes the ideal of human coexistence;
it is where the human being seeks God without limitation or
impediment, becoming a reference point for all people, bearing them
in his heart and helping them to seek God.

<p>I would also like to mention the splendid witness of nuns in the
Christian East. This witness has offered an example of giving full
value in the Church to what is specifically feminine, even breaking
through the mentality of the time. During recent persecutions,
especially in Eastern European countries, when many male monasteries
were forcibly closed, female monasticism kept the torch of the
monastic life burning. The nun's charism, with its own specific
characteristics, is a visible sign of that motherhood of God to which
Sacred Scripture often refers.

<p>Therefore I will look to monasticism in order to identify those
values which I feel are very important today for expressing the
contribution of the Christian East to the journey of Christ's Church
towards the Kingdom. While these aspects are at times neither
exclusive to monasticism nor to the Eastern heritage they have
frequently acquired a particular connotation in themselves. Besides,
we are not seeking to make the most of exclusivity, but of the mutual
enrichment in what the one Spirit has inspired in the one Church of
Christ.

<p>Monasticism has always been the very soul of the Eastern Churches:
the first Christian monks were born in the East and the monastic life
was an integral part of the Eastern <i>lumen</i> passed on to the West by
the great Fathers of the undivided Church. [26]

<p>The strong common traits uniting the monastic experience of the East
and the West make it a wonderful bridge of fellowship, where unity as
it is lived shines even more brightly than may appear in the dialogue
between the Churches.

<p><b>Between Word and Eucharist</b>

<p>10. Monasticism shows in a special way that life is suspended between
two poles: the Word of God and the Eucharist. This means that even in
its eremitical forms, it is always a personal response to an
individual call and, at the same time, an ecclesial and community
event.

<p><i>The starting point for the monk is the Work of God,</i> a Word who
calls, who invites, who personally summons, as happened to the
Apostles. When a person is touched by the Word obedience is born,
that is, the listening which changes life. Every day the monk is
nourished by the bread of the Word. Deprived of it, he is as though
dead and has nothing left to communicate to his brothers and sisters
because the Word is Christ, to whom the monk is called to be
conformed.

<p>Even while he chants with his brothers the prayer that sanctifies
time, he continues his assimilation of the Word. The very rich
liturgical hymnody, of which all the Churches of the Christian East
can be justly proud, is but the continuation of the Word which is
read, understood, assimilated and finally sung; those hymns are
largely sublime paraphrases of the biblical text, filtered and
personalized through the individual's experience and that of the
community.

<p>Standing before the abyss of divine mercy, the monk can only proclaim
the awareness of his own radical poverty, which immediately becomes a
plea for help and a cry of rejoicing on account of an even more
generous salvation, since from the abyss of his own wretchedness such
salvation is unthinkable. [27] This is why the plea for forgiveness
and the glorification of God form a substantial part of liturgical
prayer. The Christian is immersed in wonder at this paradox the
latest of an infinite series all magnified with gratitude in the
language of the liturgy the Immense accepts limitation; a virgin
gives birth; through death, he who is life conquers death forever; in
the heights of heaven, a human body is seated at the right hand of
the Father.

<p>The Eucharist is the culmination of this prayer experience, the other
pole indissolubly bound to the Word, as the place where the Word
becomes Flesh and Blood, a heavenly experience where this becomes an
event.

<p>In the Eucharist, the Church's inner nature is revealed, a community
of those summoned to the synaxis to celebrate the gift of the One who
is offering and offered: participating in the Holy Mysteries, they
become "kinsmen" [28] of Christ, anticipating the experience of
divinization in the now inseparable bond linking divinity and
humanity in Christ.

<p>But the Eucharist is also what anticipates the relationship of men
and things to the heavenly Jerusalem. In this way it reveals its
eschatological nature completely: as a living sign of this
expectation, the monk continues and brings to fulfillment in the
liturgy the invocation of the Church, the Bride who implores the
Bridegroom's return in a maranatha constantly repeated, not only in
words, but with the whole of his life.

<p><b>A liturgy for the whole man and for the whole cosmos</b>

<p>11. In the liturgical experience, Christ the Lord is the light which
illumines the way and reveals the transparency of the cosmos,
precisely as in Scripture. The events of the past find in Christ
their meaning and fullness, and creation is revealed for what it is:
a complex whole which finds its perfection, its purpose in the
liturgy alone. This is why the liturgy is heaven on earth, and in it
the Word who became flesh imbues matter with a saving potential which
is fully manifest in the sacraments: there, creation communicates to
each individual the power conferred on it by Christ. Thus the Lord,
immersed in the Jordan, transmits to the waters a power which enables
them to become the bath of baptismal rebirth. [29]

<p>Within this framework, liturgical prayer in the East shows a great
aptitude for involving the human person in his or her totality: the
mystery is sung in the loftiness of its content, but also in the
warmth of the sentiments it awakens in the heart of redeemed
humanity. In the sacred act, even bodiliness is summoned to praise,
and beauty, which in the East is one of the best loved names
expressing the divine harmony and the model of humanity
transfigured, [30] appears everywhere: in the shape of the church, in
the sounds, in the cc ours, in the lights, in the scents. The lengthy
duration of the celebrations, the repeated invocations everything
expresses gradual identification with the mystery celebrated with
one's whole person. Thus the prayer of the Church already becomes
participation in the heavenly liturgy, an anticipation of the final
beatitude.

<p>This total involvement of the person in his rational and emotional
aspects, in "ecstasy" and in immanence, is of great interest and a
wonderful way to understand the meaning of created realities: these
are neither an absolute nor a den of sin and iniquity. In the
liturgy, things reveal their own nature as a gift offered by the
Creator to humanity: "God saw everything that he had made, and
behold, it was very good" (Gen 1:31). Though all this is marked by
the tragedy of sin, which weighs down matter and obscures its
clarity, the latter is redeemed in the Incarnation and becomes fully
"theophoric", that is, capable of putting us in touch with the
Father. This property is most apparent in the holy mysteries, the
sacraments of the Church.

<p>Christianity does not reject matter. Rather, bodiliness is considered
in all its value in the liturgical act whereby the human body is
disclosed in its inner nature as a temple of the Spirit and is united
with the Lord Jesus, who himself took a body for the world's
salvation. This does not mean however, an absolute exaltation of all
that is physical, for we know well the chaos which sin introduced
into the harmony of the human being. The liturgy reveals that the
body through the mystery of the Cross, is in the process of
transfiguration, pneumatization: on Mount Tabor Christ showed his
body radiant, as the Father wants it to be again.

<p>Cosmic reality also is summoned to give thanks because the whole
universe is called to recapitulation in Christ the Lord. This concept
expresses a balanced and marvellous teaching on the dignity, respect
and purpose of creation and of the human body in particular. With the
rejection of all dualism and every cult of pleasure as an end in
itself, the body becomes a place made luminous by grace and thus
fully human.

<p>To those who seek a truly meaningful relationship with themselves and
with the cosmos, so often disfigured by selfishness and greed, the
liturgy reveals the way to the harmony of the new man, and invites
him to respect the Eucharistic potential of the created world. That
world is destined to be assumed in the Eucharist of the Lord, in his
Passover, present in the sacrifice of the altar.

<p><b>A clear look at self-discovery</b>

<p>12. The monk turns his gaze to Christ, God and man. In the disfigured
face of Christ, the man of sorrow, he sees the prophetic announcement
of the transfigured face of the Risen Christ. To the contemplative
eye, Christ reveals himself as he did to the women of Jerusalem, who
had gone up to contemplate the mysterious spectacle on Calvary.
Trained in this school, the monk becomes accustomed to contemplating
Christ in the hidden recesses of creation and in the history of
mankind, which is then understood from the standpoint of progressive
identification with the whole Christ.

<p>This gaze progressively conformed to Christ thus learns detachment
from externals, from the tumult of the senses, from all that keeps
man from that freedom which allows him to be grasped by the Spirit.
Walking this path, he is reconciled with Christ in a constant process
of conversion: in the awareness of his own sin and of his distance
from the Lord which becomes heartfelt remorse, a symbol of his own
baptism in the salutary water of tears; in silence and inner quiet
which is sought and given, where he learns to make his heart beat in
harmony with the rhythm of the Spirit, eliminating all duplicity and
ambiguity. This process of becoming ever more moderate and sparing
more transparent to himself can cause him to fall into pride and
intransigence if he comes to believe that these are the fruits of his
own ascetic efforts. Spiritual discernment in continuous purification
then makes him humble and meek, aware that he can perceive only some
aspects of that truth which fills him, because it is the gift of the
Spouse, who alone is fulfillment and happiness.

<p>To the person who is seeking the meaning of life the East offers this
school which teaches one to know oneself and to be free and loved by
that Jesus who says: "Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest" (Mt 11:28). He tells those who seek inner
healing to go on searching: if their intention is upright and their
way is honest, in the end the Father's face will let itself be
recognized engraved as it is in the depths of the human heart.

<p><b>A father in the Spirit</b>

<p>13. A monk's way is not generally marked by personal effort alone. He
turns to a spiritual father to whom he abandons himself with filial
trust, in the certainty that God's tender and demanding fatherhood is
manifested in him. This figure gives Eastern monasticism an
extraordinary flexibility: through the spiritual father's
intervention the way of each monk is in fact strongly personalized in
the times, rhythms and ways of seeking God. Precisely because the
spiritual father is the harmonizing link, monasticism is permitted
the greatest variety of coenobitic and eremitical expressions.
Monasticism in the East has thus been able to fulfil the expectations
of each Church in the various periods of its history. [31]

<p>In this quest, the East in particular teaches that there are brothers
and sisters to whom the Spirit has granted the gift of spiritual
guidance. They are precious points of reference, for they see things
with the loving gaze with which God looks at us. It is not a question
of renouncing one's own freedom, in order to be looked after by
others. It is benefiting from the knowledge of the heart, which is a
true charism, in order to be helped, gently and firmly, to find the
way of truth. Our world desperately needs such spiritual guides. It
has frequently rejected them, for they seemed to lack credibility or
their example appeared out of date and scarcely attractive to current
sensitivities. Nevertheless, it is having a hard time finding new
ones, and so suffers in fear and uncertainty, without models or
reference points. He who is a father in the spirit, if he really is
such--and the people of God have always shown their ability to
recognize him--will not make others equal to himself, but will help
them find the way to the Kingdom.

<p>Of course, the wonderful gift of male and female monastic life, which
safeguards the gift of guidance in the Spirit and calls for
appropriate recognition, has also been given to the West. In this
context and wherever grace has inspired these precious means of
interior growth, may those in charge foster this gift and use it to
good advantage, and may all avail themselves of it. Thus they will
experience the great comfort and support of fatherhood in the Spirit
on their journey of faith. [32]

<p><b>Communion and service</b>

<p>14. Precisely in gradual detachment from those worldly things which
stand in the way of communion with his Lord, the monk finds the world
a place where the beauty of the Creator and the love of the Redeemer
are reflected. In his prayers the monk utters an <i>epiklesis</i> of the
Spirit on the world and is certain that he will be heard, for this is
a sharing in Christ's own prayer. Thus he feels rising within himself
a deep love for humanity, that love which Eastern prayer so often
celebrates as an attribute of God, the friend of men who did not
hesitate to offer his Son so that the world might be saved. In this
attitude the monk is sometimes enabled to contemplate that world
already transfigured by the deifying action of Christ, who died and
rose again.

<p>Whatever path the Spirit has in store for him, the monk is always
essentially the man of communion. Since antiquity this name has also
indicated the monastic style of coenobitic life. Monasticism shows us
how there is no true vocation that is not born of the Church and for
the Church. This is attested by the experience of so many monks who,
within their cells pray with an extraordinary passion, not only for
the human person but for every creature, in a ceaseless cry that all
may be converted to the saving stream of Christ's love. This path of
inner liberation in openness to the Other makes the monk a man of
charity. In the school of Paul the Apostle, who showed that love is
the fulfilling of the law (cf. Rom 13:10), Eastern monastic communion
has always been careful to guarantee the superiority of love over
every law.

<p>This communion is revealed first and foremost in service to one's
brothers in monastic life, but also to the Church community, in forms
which vary in time and place, ranging from social assistance to
itinerant preaching. The Eastern Churches have lived this endeavour
with great generosity, starting with evangelization, the highest
service that the Christian can offer his brother, followed by many
other forms of spiritual and material service. Indeed it can be said
that monasticism in antiquity--and at various times in subsequent
ages too--has been the privileged means for the evangelization of
peoples.

<p><b>A person in relationship</b>

<p>15. The monk's life is evidence of the unity that exists in the East
between spirituality and theology: the Christian, and the monk in
particular, more than seeking abstract truths, knows that his Lord
alone is Truth and Life, but also knows that he is the Way (cf. Jn
14:6) to reach both; knowledge and participation are thus a single
reality: from the person to the God who is three Persons through the
Incarnation of the Word of God.

<p>The East helps us to express the Christian meaning of the human
person with a wealth of elements. It is centred on the Incarnation,
from which creation itself draws light. In Christ, true God and true
man, the fullness of the human vocation is revealed. In order for man
to become God, the Word took on humanity. Man, who constantly
experiences the bitter taste of his limitations and sin, does not
then abandon himself to recrimination or to anguish, because he knows
that within himself the power of divinity is at work. Humanity was
assumed by Christ without separation from his divine nature and
without confusion, [33] and man is not left alone to attempt, in a
thousand often frustrated ways, an impossible ascent to heaven. There
is a tabernacle of glory, which is the most holy person of Jesus the
Lord, where the divine and the human meet in an embrace that can
never be separated. The Word became flesh, like us in everything
except sin. He pours divinity into the sick heart of humanity, and
imbuing it with the Father's Spirit enables it to become God through
grace.

<p>But if this has revealed the Son to us, then it is given us to
approach the mystery of the Father, principle of communion in love.
The Most Holy Trinity appears to us then as a community of love: to
know such a God means to feel the urgent need for him to speak to the
world, to communicate himself; and the history of salvation is
nothing but the history of God's love for the creature he has loved
and chosen, wanting it to be "according to the icon of the Icon"--as
the insight of the Eastern Fathers expresses it [34]-- that is moulded
in the image of the Image, which is the Son, brought to perfect
communion by the sanctifier, the Spirit of love. Even when man sins,
this God seeks him and loves him, so that the relationship may not be
broken off and love may continue to flow. And God loves man in the
mystery of the Son, who let himself be put to death on the Cross by a
world that did not recognize him, but has been raised up again by the
Father as an eternal guarantee that no one can destroy love, for
anyone who shares in it is touched by God's glory: it is this man
transformed by love whom the disciples contemplated on Tabor, the man
whom we are all called to be.

<p><b>An adoring silence</b>

<p>16. Nevertheless this mystery is continuously veiled enveloped in
silence, [35] lest an idol be created in place of God. Only in a
progressive purification of the knowledge of communion, will man and
God meet and recognize in an eternal embrace their unending
connaturality of love.

<p>Thus is born what is called the <i>apophatism</i> of the Christian East:
the more man grows in the knowledge of God, the more he perceives him
as an inaccessible mystery, whose essence cannot be grasped. This
should not be confused with an obscure mysticism in which man loses
himself in enigmatic, impersonal realities. On the contrary, the
Christians of the East turn to God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
living persons tenderly present, to whom they utter a solemn and
humble, majestic and simple liturgical doxology. But they perceive
that one draws close to this presence above all by letting oneself be
taught an adoring silence, for at the culmination of the knowledge
and experience of God is his absolute transcendence. This is reached
through the prayerful assimilation of Scripture and the liturgy more
than by systematic meditation

<p>In the humble acceptance of the creature's limits before the infinite
transcendence of a God who never ceases to reveal himself as
God-Love, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the joy of the Holy
Spirit, I see expressed the attitude of prayer and the theological
method which the East prefers and continues to offer all believers in
Christ.

<p>We must confess that we all have need of this silence, filled with
the presence of him who is adored: in theology, so as to exploit
fully its own sapiential and spiritual soul; in prayer, so that we
may never forget that seeing God means coming down the mountain with
a face so radiant that we are obliged to cover it with a veil (cf. Ex
34:33), and that our gatherings may make room for God's presence and
avoid self-celebration; in preaching, so as not to delude ourselves
that it is enough to heap word upon word to attract people to the
experience of God, in commitment, so that we will refuse to be locked
in a struggle without love and forgiveness. This is what man needs
today; he is often unable to be silent for fear of meeting himself,
of feeling the emptiness that asks itself about meaning; man who
deafens himself with noise. All, believers and non- believers alike,
need to learn a silence that allows the Other to speak when and how
he wishes, and allows us to understand his words.

<p><b>II From knowledge to encounter</b>

<p>17. Thirty years have passed since the Bishops of the Catholic
Church, meeting in Council in the presence of many brothers from
other Churches and Ecclesial Communities, listened to the voice of
the Spirit as he shed light on deep truths about the nature of the
Church, showing that all believers in Christ were far closer than
they could imagine, all journeying towards the one Lord, all
sustained and supported by his grace. An ever more pressing
invitation to unity emerged at that point.

<p>Since then, much ground has been covered in reciprocal knowledge.
This has increased our respect and has frequently enabled us to pray
to the one Lord together and to pray for one another, on a path of
love that is already a pilgrimage of unity.

<p>After the important steps taken by Pope Paul VI, I have wished the
path of mutual knowledge in charity to be continued. I can testify to
the deep joy that the fraternal meeting with so many heads and
representatives of Churches and Ecclesial Communities has given me in
recent years. Together we have shared our concerns and expectations,
together we have called for union between our Churches and peace for
the world. Together we have felt more responsible for the common
good, not only as individuals, but in the name of the Christians
whose Pastors the Lord has made us. Sometimes urgent appeals from
other Churches, threatened or stricken with violence and abuse have
reached this See of Rome. It has sought to open its heart to them
all. As soon as he could, the Bishop of Rome has raised his voice for
them, so that people of goodwill might hear the cry of those
suffering brothers and sisters of ours.

<p>"Among the sins which require a greater commitment to repentance and
conversion should certainly be counted those which have been
detrimental to the unity willed by God for his People. In the course
of the thousand years now drawing to a dose, even more than in the
first millennium ecclesial communion has been painfully wounded, a
fact for which, often enough, men of both sides were to blame'. [36]
Such wounds openly contradict the will of Christ and are a cause of
scandal to the world. These sins of the past unfortunately still
burden us and remain ever present temptations. It is necessary to
make amends for them and earnestly to beseech Christ's
forgiveness." [37]

<p>The sin of our separation is very serious: I feel the need to
increase our common openness to the Spirit who calls us to
conversion, to accept and recognize others with fraternal respect, to
make fresh, courageous gestures, able to dispel any temptation to
turn back. We feel the need to go beyond the degree of communion we
have reached.

<p>18. Every day, I have a growing desire to go over the history of the
Churches, in order to write at last a history of our unity and thus
return to the time when, after the Death and Resurrection of the Lord
Jesus, the Gospel spread to the most varied cultures and a most
fruitful exchange began which still today is evidenced in the
liturgies of the Churches. Despite difficulties and differences, the
letters of the Apostles (cf. 2 Cor 9: 11-14) and of the Fathers [38]
show very close, fraternal links between the Churches in a full
communion of faith, with respect for their specific features and
identity. The common experience of martyrdom and meditation on the
acts of the martyrs of every Church, sharing in the doctrine of so
many holy teachers of the faith, in deep exchange and sharing
strengthen this wonderful feeling of unity. [39] The development of
different experiences of ecclesial life did not prevent Christians,
through mutual relations, from continuing to feel certain that they
were at home in any Church, because praise of the one Father, through
Christ in the Holy Spirit, rose from them all, in a marvellous
variety of languages and melodies; all were gathered together to
celebrate the Eucharist, the heart and model for the community
regarding not only spirituality and the moral life, but also the
Church's very structure, in the variety of ministries and services
under the leadership of the Bishop, successor of the Apostles. [40]
The first Councils are an eloquent witness to this enduring unity in
diversity. [41]

<p>Even when certain dogmatic misunderstandings became reinforced--often
magnified by the influence of political and cultural factors--leading
to sad consequences in relations between the Churches, the effort to
call for and to promote the unity of the Church remained alive. When
the ecumenical dialogue first began, the Holy Spirit enabled us to be
strengthened in our common faith, a perfect continuation of the
apostolic kerygma, and for this we thank God with all our heart. [42]
Although in the first centuries of the Christian era conflicts were
already slowly starting to emerge within the body of the Church, we
cannot forget that unity between Rome and Constantinople endured for
the whole of the first rnillennium, despite difficulties. We have
increasingly learned that it was not so much an historical episode or
a mere question of pre-eminence that tore the fabric of unity, as it
was a progressive estrangement, so that the other's diversity was no
longer perceived as a common treasure but as incompatibility. Even
when the second millennium experienced a hardening of the polemics
and the separation, with mutual ignorance and prejudice increasing
all the more, nonetheless constructive meetings between Church
leaders desirous of intensifying relations and fostering exchanges
did not cease, nor did the holy efforts of men and women who,
recognizing the setting of one group against the other as a grave
sin, and being in love with unity and charity, attempted in many ways
to promote the search for communion by prayer, study and reflection,
and by open and cordial interaction. [43] All this praiseworthy work
was to converge in the reflections of the Second Vatican Council and
to be symbolized in the abrogation of the reciprocal excommunications
of 1054 by Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I. [44]

<p>19. The way of charity is experiencing new moments of difficulty
following the recent events which have involved Central and Eastern
Europe. Christian brothers and sisters who together had suffered
persecution are regarding one another with suspicion and fear just
when prospects and hopes of greater freedom are appearing: is this
not a new, serious risk of sin which we must all make every effort to
overcome, if we want the peoples who are seeking the God of love to
be able to find him more easily, instead of being scandalized anew by
our wounds and conflicts? When, on Good Friday 1994, His Holiness
Bartholomew I, Patriarch of Constantinople, offered the Church of
Rome his meditations on the Way of the Cross, I recalled this
communion in the recent experience of martyrdom: ."..We are united in
these martyrs from Rome, from the 'Hill of Crosses', the Solovets
Islands and so many other extermination camps. We are united against
the background of these martyrs, we cannot fail to be united." [45]

<p>Thus it is urgently necessary to become aware of this most serious
responsibility: today we can co-operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or
we can become the upholders of new divisions. May the Lord open our
hearts, convert our minds and inspire in us concrete, courageous
steps, capable if necessary of breaking through cliches, easy
resignation or stalemate. If those who want to be first are called to
become the servants of all, then the primacy of love will be seen to
grow from the courage of this charity. I pray the Lord to inspire,
first of all in myself and in the Bishops of the Catholic Church,
concrete actions as a witness to this inner certitude. The deepest
nature of the Church demands it. Every time we celebrate the
Eucharist, the sacrament of communion, we find in the Body and Blood
we share the sacrament and the call to our unity. [46] How can we be
fully credible if we stand divided before the Eucharist, if we cannot
live our sharing in the same Lord whom we are called to proclaim to
the world? In view of our reciprocal exclusion from the Eucharist, we
feel our poverty and the need to make every effort so that the day
may come when we will partake together of the same bread and the same
cup. [47] Then the Eucharist will once again be fully perceived as a
prophecy of the Kingdom, and these words from a very ancient
Eucharistic Prayer will resound with full truth: "Just as this broken
bread, once scattered on the hills and gathered up, became one, so
may your Church be gathered from the ends of the earth into your
kingdom." [48]

<p><b>Experiences of unity</b>

<p>20. Particularly significant anniversaries encourage us to turn our
thoughts with affection and reverence to the Eastern Churches. First
of all, as has been said, the centenary of the Apostolic Letter
<i>Orientalium dignitas</i>. Since that time a journey began which has led
among other things, in 1917, to the creation of the Congregation for
the Oriental Churches [49] and the foundation of the Pontifical
Oriental Institute [50] by Pope Benedict XV. Subsequently, on 5 June
1960 John XXIII founded the Secretariat for Promoting Christian
Unity. [51] In recent times, on 18 October 1990, I promulgated the
Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, [52] in order to safeguard and
to promote the specific features of the Eastern heritage.

<p>These are signs of an attitude that the Church of Rome has always
felt was an integral part of the mandate entrusted by Jesus Christ to
the Apostle Peter: to confirm his brothers in faith and unity (cf. Lk
22:32). Attempts in the past had their limits, deriving from the
mentality of the times and the very understanding of the truths about
the Church. But here I would like to reassert that this commitment is
rooted in the conviction that Peter (cf. Mt 19:17-19) intends to
place himself at the service of a Church united in charity. "Peter's
task is to search constantly for ways that will help preserve unity.
Therefore he must not create obstacles but must open up paths. Nor is
this in any way at odds with the duty entrusted to him by Christ:
'strengthen your brothers in the faith' (cf. Lk 22:32). It is
significant that Christ said these words precisely at the moment when
Peter was about to deny him. It was as if the Master himself wanted
to tell Peter: 'Remember that you are weak, that you, too, need
endless conversion. You are able to strengthen others only insofar as
you are aware of your own weakness. I entrust to you as your
responsibility the truth, the great truth of God, meant for man's
salvation, but this truth cannot be preached or put into practice
except by loving'. <i>Veritatem facere in caritate</i> (To live the truth
in love, cf. Eph 4:15); this is what is always necessary." [53] Today
we know that unity can be achieved through the love of God only if
the Churches want it together, in full respect for the traditions of
each and for necessary autonomy. We know that this can take place
only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly
called to manifest the one Church of Christ, born from one Baptism
and from one Eucharist, and which want to be sisters. [54] As I had
occasion to say: "the Church of Christ is one. If divisions exist
that is one thing; they must be overcome, but the Church is one, the
Church of Christ between East and West can only be one, one and
united." [55]

<p>Of course, in today's outlook it appears that true union is possible
only in total respect for the other's dignity without claiming that
the whole array of uses and customs in the Latin Church is more
complete or better suited to showing the fullness of correct
doctrine; and again, that this union must be preceded by an awareness
of communion that permeates the whole Church and is not limited to an
agreement among leaders. Today we are conscious--and this has
frequently been reasserted--that unity will be achieved how and when
the Lord desires, and that it will require the contribution of love's
sensitivity and creativity, perhaps even going beyond the forms
already tried in history. [56]

<p>21. The Eastern Churches which entered into full communion with Rome
wished to be an expression of this concern, according to the degree
of maturity of the ecclesial awareness of the time. [57] In entering
into catholic communion, they did not at all intend to deny their
fidelity to their own tradition, to which they have borne witness
down the centuries with heroism and often by shedding their blood.
And if sometimes, in their relations with the Orthodox Churches,
misunderstandings and open opposition have arisen, we all know that
we must ceaselessly implore divine mercy and a new heart capable of
reconciliation over and above any wrong suffered or inflicted.

<p>It has been stressed several times that the full union of the
Catholic Eastern Churches with the Church of Rome which has already
been achieved must not imply a diminished awareness of their own
authenticity and originality. [58] Wherever this occurred, the Second
Vatican Council has urged them to rediscover their full identity,
because they have "the right and the duty to govern themselves
according to their own special disciplines. For these are guaranteed
by ancient tradition, and seem to be better suited to the customs of
their faithful and to the good of their souls." [59] These Churches
carry a tragic wound, for they are still kept from full communion
with the Eastern Orthodox Churches despite sharing in the heritage of
their fathers. A constant, shared conversion is indispensable for
them to advance resolutely and energetically towards mutual
understanding. And conversion is also required of the Latin Church,
that she may respect and fully appreciate the dignity of Eastern
Christians and accept gratefully the spiritual treasures of which the
Eastern Catholic Churches are the bearers, to the benefit of the
entire catholic communion; [60] that she may show concretely, far more
than in the past, how much she esteems and admires the Christian East
and how essential she considers its contribution to the full
realization of the Church's universality.

<p><b>Meeting one another, getting to know one another, working together</b>

<p>22. I have a keen desire that the words which Saint Paul addressed
from the East to the faithful of the Church of Rome may resound today
on the lips of Christians of the West with regard to their brothers
and sisters of the Eastern Churches: "First, I thank my God through
Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all
the world" (Rom 1:8). The Apostle of the Gentiles then immediately
and enthusiastically stated his intention: "For I long to see you,
that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that
is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both
yours and mine" (Rom 1:11-12). Here, the dynamic of our meeting is
wonderfully portrayed: knowledge of the treasures of others'
faith--which I have just tried to describe-- spontaneously produces
the incentive for a new and more intimate meeting between brothers
and sisters, which will be a true and sincere mutual exchange. It is
an incentive which the Spirit constantly inspires in the Church and
which becomes more insistent precisely in the moments of greatest
difficulty.

<p>23. I am also well aware that at this time certain tensions between
the Church of Rome and some of the Eastern Churches are making the
path of mutual esteem more difficult with regard to future communion.
Several times this See of Rome has made a point of issuing directives
favouring the common progress of all the Churches at so important a
time for the life of the world, especially in Eastern Europe, where
dramatic events of recent history have often prevented the Eastern
Churches from properly fulfilling the mandate of evangelization which
they nevertheless felt keenly. [61] Situations of greater freedom are
offering them fresh opportunities today, although the means available
to them are limited because of difficult circumstances in the
countries where they are active. I would like forcefully to affirm
that the communities of the West are ready to encourage in every
way--and many are already working along these lines--<i>the
intensification of this ministry of "diakonia"</i>, making available to
such Churches the experience acquired in the years when charity was
more freely exercised. Woe to us if the abundance of some were to
produce the humiliation of others or a sterile and scandalous
rivalry. On their part, Western communities will make it their duty
above all to share, where possible, service projects with their
brothers and sisters in the Eastern Churches or to assist in bringing
to a successful conclusion ail that the latter are doing to help
their people. In any case, in territories where both are present, the
Western Communities will never show an attitude which could appear
disrespectful of the exhausting efforts which the Eastern Churches
are making, efforts which are all the more to their credit given the
precariousness of the resources available to them.

<p>To extend gestures of common charity to one another and jointly to
those in need will appear as an act with immediate impact. To avoid
this or even to witness to the contrary, will make all those who
observe us think that every commitment to a rapprochement in charity
between the Churches is merely an abstract statement, without
conviction or concreteness.

<p>I feel that the Lord's call to work in every way to ensure that all
believers in Christ will witness together to their own faith is
fundamental, especially in the territories where the children of the
Catholic Church-- Latin and Eastern--and children of the Orthodox
Churches live together in large numbers. After their common martyrdom
suffered for Christ under the oppression of atheist regimes, the time
has come to suffer, if necessary, in order never to fail in the
witness of charity among Christians, for even if we gave our body to
be burned but had not charity, it would serve no purpose (cf. 1 Cor
13:3). We must pray intensely that the Lord will soften our minds and
hearts and grant us patience and meekness.

<p>24. I believe that one important way to grow in mutual understanding
and unity consists precisely in improving our knowledge of one
another. The children of the Catholic Church already know the ways
indicated by the Holy See for achieving this: to know the liturgy of
the Eastern Churches; [62] to deepen their knowledge of the spiritual
traditions of the Fathers and doctors of the Christian East, [63] to
follow the example of the Eastern Churches for the inculturation of
the Gospel message; to combat tensions between Latins and Orientals
and to encourage dialogue between Catholics and the Orthodox; to
train in specialized institutions theologians, liturgists, historians
and canonists for the Christian East who in turn can spread knowledge
of the Eastern; Churches; to offer appropriate teaching on these
subjects in seminaries and theological faculties, especially to
future priests. [64] These remain very sound recommendations on which
I intend to insist with particular force.

<p>25. In addition to knowledge, I feel that meeting one another
regularly is very important. In this regard, I hope that monasteries
will make a particular effort, precisely because of the unique role
played by monastic life within the Churches and because of the many
unifying aspects of the monastic experience, and therefore of
spiritual awareness, in the East and in the West. Another form of
meeting consists in welcoming Orthodox professors and students to the
Pontifical Universities and other Catholic academic institutions. We
will continue to do all we can to extend this welcome on a wider
scale. May God also bless the founding and development of places
designed precisely to offer hospitality to our brothers of the East,
including such places in this city of Rome where the living, shared
memory of the leaders of the Apostles and of so many martyrs is
preserved.

<p>It is important that meetings and exchanges should involve Church
communities in the broadest forms and ways. We know for example how
positive interparish activities such as "twinning" can be for mutual
cultural and spiritual enrichment, and also for the exercise of
charity.

<p>I judge very positively the initiatives of joint pilgrimages to
places where holiness is particularly expressed in remembering men
and women who in every age have enriched the Church with the
sacrifice of their lives. In this direction it would also be a highly
significant act to arrive at a common recognition of the holiness of
those Christians who, in recent decades, particularly in the
countries of Eastern Europe, have shed their blood for the one faith
in Christ.

<p>26. A particular thought goes to the lands of the diaspora where many
faithful of the Eastern Churches who have left their countries of
origin are living in a mainly Latin environment. These places, where
peaceful contact is easier within a pluralist society, could be an
ideal environment for improving and intensifying co-operation between
the Churches in training future priests and in pastoral and
charitable projects, also for the benefit of the Orientals' countries
of origin.

<p>I particularly urge the Latin Ordinaries in these countries to study
attentively grasp thoroughly and apply faithfully the principles
issued by this Holy See concerning ecumenical co-operation [65] and
the pastoral care of the faithful of the Eastern Catholic Churches,
especially when they lack their own hierarchy.

<p>I invite the Eastern Catholic Bishops and clergy to collaborate
closely with the Latin Ordinaries for an effective apostolate which
is not fragmented, especially when their jurisdiction covers immense
territories where the absence of co-operation means, in effect
isolation. The Eastern Catholic Bishops will not neglect any means of
encouraging an atmosphere of brotherhood, sincere mutual esteem and
co-operation with their brothers in the Churches with which we are
not yet united in full communion, especially with those who belong to
the same ecclesial tradition.

<p>Where in the West there are no Eastern priests to look after the
faithful of the Eastern Catholic Churches, Latin Ordinaries and their
co-workers should see that those faithful grow in the awareness and
knowledge of their own tradition, and they should be invited to
co-operate actively in the growth of the Christian community by
making their own particular contribution.

<p>27. With regard to monasticism, in consideration of its importance in
Eastern Christianity, we would like it to flourish once more in the
Eastern Catholic Churches, and that support be given to all those who
feel called to work for its revitalization. [66] In fact, in the East
an intrinsic link exists between liturgical prayer, spiritual
tradition and monastic life. For this reason precisely, a
well-trained and motivated renewal of monastic life could mean true
ecclesial fruitfulness for them as well. Nor should it be thought
that this would diminish the effectiveness of the pastoral minis try
which in fact will be strengthened by such a vigorous spirituality,
and thus will find once more its ideal place. This hope also concerns
the territories of the Eastern diaspora, where the presence of
Eastern monasteries would give greater stability to the Eastern
Churches in those countries, and would make a valuable contribution
to the religious life of Western Christians.

<p><b>Journeying together towards the "Orientale Lumen"</b>

<p>28. In concluding this Letter, my thoughts turn to my beloved
brothers and sisters the Patriarchs Bishops, Priests and Deacons, the
Monks and Nuns the men and women of the Eastern Churches.

<p>On the threshold of the third millennium we all hear in our Sees the
cry of those oppressed by the burden of grave threats, but who,
perhaps even without realizing it, long to know what God in his love
intended. These people feel that a ray of light, if it is welcomed is
capable of dispelling the shadows which cover the horizon of the
Father's tenderness.

<p>Mary, "Mother of the star that never sets" [67] "dawn of the mystical
day", [68] "rising of the sun of glory", [69] shows us the <i>Orientale
Lumen</i>.

<p>Every day in the East the sun of hope rises again the light that
restores life to the human race. It is from the East, according to a
lovely image, that our Saviour will come again (cf. Mt 24:27).

<p>For us, the men and women of the East are a symbol of the Lord who
comes again. We cannot forget them, not only because we love them as
brothers and sisters redeemed by the same Lord, but also because a
holy nostalgia for the centuries lived in the full communion of faith
and charity urges us and reproaches us for our sins and our mutual
misunderstandings: we have deprived the world of a joint witness that
could, perhaps, have avoided so many tragedies and even changed the
course of history.

<p>We are painfully aware that we cannot yet share in the same
Eucharist. Now that the millennium is drawing to a close and our gaze
turns to the rising Sun, with gratitude we find these men and women
before our eyes and in our heart.

<p>The echo of the Gospel--the words that do not disappoint--continues
to resound with force, weakened only by our separation: Christ cries
out, but man finds it hard to hear his voice, because we fail to
speak with one accord. We listen together to the cry of those who
want to hear God's entire Word. The words of the West need the words
of the East, so that God's word may ever more clearly reveal its
unfathomable riches. Our words will meet for ever in the heavenly
Jerusalem, but we ask and wish that this meeting be anticipated in
the holy Church which is still on her way towards the fullness of the
Kingdom.

<p>May God shorten the time and distance. may Christ, the <i>Orientale
Lumen</i>, soon, very soon, grant us to discover that in fact, despite
so many centuries of distance, we were very close, because together,
perhaps without knowing it, we were walking towards the one Lord, and
thus towards one another.

<p>May the people of the third millennium be able to enjoy this
discovery, finally achieved by a word that is harmonious and thus
fully credible, proclaimed by brothers and sisters who love one
another and thank one another for the riches which they exchange.
Thus shall we offer ourselves to God with the pure hands of
reconciliation, and the people of the world will have one more
well-founded reason to believe and to hope.

<p>With these wishes I impart my Blessing to all.

<p>From the Vatican, on 2 May, the liturgical memorial of Saint
Athanasius, Bishop and Doctor of the Church, in the year 1995, the
seventeenth of my Pontificate.
