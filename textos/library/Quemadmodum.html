<h1>Quemadmodum</h1>  
<p><b>A Plea for the Care of the World's Destitute Children
<br>His Holiness Pope Pius XII
<br>Promulgated on January 6, 1946</b>

<p><i>To the Venerable Brethren: The Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Ordinaries Having Peace and Communion With the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>WHILE THE TERRIBLE WAR RAGED We used all Our powers of persuasion and
appeal to bring to a speedy end a conflict which had lasted all too long
and to secure an agreement guaranteeing justice, equity and right. The
same way now that fighting has ceased, but peace has not yet been
restored, in virtue of Our apostolic office, We are leaving nothing
undone to provide timely relief for so many ills and all possible comfort
for the accumulated miseries that weigh on not a few nations. But of the
almost countless ills born of the dire struggle none so hurts or so
wounds Our paternal heart as that which involves a host of innocent
children, millions of whom it is estimated are in many countries without
the necessities of life and are suffering from cold, hunger and disease.
Often, too, in their utter dereliction they feel the want not only of
food, clothes and shelter but also of the affection which their tender
years so need.

<p>2. As you know, Venerable Brethren, We have done all that We could to
solve this problem. And We gladly take this occasion to express Our
sincerest gratitude to those through whose liberality We have been able
to alleviate somewhat the need of these infants and children. We know,
too, that many have individually or as members of societies and
organizations undertaken to help or are already actively at work. To
these, worthy of all praise as they are, We pay due tribute and pray God
to bless their activities, their plans for the future, their achievements.

<p>3. But since help of this kind is entirely inadequate to the immense
task, We have deemed it Our duty to turn to you and paternally urge you
to take to heart the extremely grave plight of these needy children,
leaving nothing undone that may contribute to ease their lot and bring
relief.

<p>4. We ordain, therefore, that in each of your dioceses you assign a day
on which public prayers will be offered to appease God's anger and on
which through your priests you will admonish the faithful of this urgent
need and exhort them to support by their prayers, good works and
offerings every movement that is directing its forces fully and
effectively for the succor of needy and abandoned children.

<p>5. This is a problem, of course, which touches all citizens, whatever be
their views, if
only their hearts respond to the appeals of nature and religion. But it
belongs, in a special sense, to Christians who should see stamped on
these poor destitute little brothers the image of the Divine Child and
who are bound to heed those words: "Amen I say to you, as long as you did
it for one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it for me" (Matt.
25, 40).

<p>6. Let all remember and reflect that these children will be pillars of
the next generation and that it is essential that they grow up healthy in
mind and body if we are to avoid a race infected with sickness and vice.
Nobody should hesitate, then, to contribute time and money to a cause so
opportune and essential. Those who are themselves less wealthy should
give what they can with open hand and willing heart. Those who live in
luxury should reflect and remember that the indigence, hunger and
nakedness of these children will constitute a grave and severe indictment
of them before God, the Father of mercies, if they harden their hearts
and do not contribute generously. All, finally, should be convinced that
their liberality will not be loss but gain, for we can safely say that
one who gives from his means to the poor is lending to God Who, in His
own time, will repay his generosity with abundant interest.

<p>7. We firmly trust that, as in Apostolic times, when the Christian
population of Jerusalem was subjected to poverty and persecution, the
rest of the faithful throughout the world contributed their prayers and
material aid. (Cf. I Cor. 16,1) so now, too, all will be inspired and
animated by the same charity and will help as much as they can. This they
should do, as We have said, especially by fervent prayer to our most
merciful Redeemer. For, as you know, fervent prayer carries with it a
mystic power that penetrates Heaven and calls down supernatural light and
Divine impulses to illumine men's minds and incline their wills to good,
to persuade and move them to charity.

<p>8. Let us recall that in every age the Church has exercised the most
diligent care of the young and has rightly deemed this as an official
mission assigned in a very special way to her charity. And as she did
this and continues to do it, she undoubtedly was following in the
footsteps and obeying the injunctions of her Divine Founder, Who, gently
gathering the children around Him, said to the Apostles who rebuked their
mothers: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for
of such is the kingdom of God" (Mark 10, 14). For Christ, as Our
predecessor of immortal memory, Leo the Great, very well says, "loves
childhood which He had first assumed in mind and body. Christ loves
childhood, the school of humility, the norm of innocence, the model of
meekness. Christ loves childhood towards which He directs morality, to
which He leads back the old age of men. Those whom He calls to His
eternal kingdom above He inspires to follow His example" (Serm. XXXVII C.
3, ML 54, 258 C).

<p>9. In the light of such words and sentiments, Venerable Brethren, you see
with what love, diligence and care the Church looks after infants and
children following the lead of her Founder. While she exercises all
possible care to see that they be provided with food, shelter and
clothing for their bodies, she does not ignore or neglect their souls
which--born, so to speak, from the breath of God--seem to portray the
radiant beauty of Heaven. Her first care and endeavor is, then, to
preserve their innocence from stain and provide for their eternal
salvation.

<p>10. Accordingly, there are numberless institutions and organizations to
educate the young, form them to solid virtue, and satisfy their needs in
education as they grow in mind and body. In this important field, as you
know, many Religious Orders and congregations of men and women are
laboring with admirable zeal and effect, and their prudent, alert,
devoted activity is making a magnificent contribution to the progress of
Church and State. This is being done not only in civilized countries,
with large and excellent results, but also among uncultured peoples or
those which the light of Christian truth has not yet reached, where
missionary endeavor and, especially, the Pontifical Society of the Holy
Childhood, rescues so many children and infants from the slavery of the
devil and of wicked men, procuring for them the freedom of the children
of God, and trains them to be members of civilized society.

<p>11. But at this tragic moment of history, when--alas--material and
spiritual ruins are piled high, these providential charitable
enterprises, which, perhaps, seemed capable of dealing with normal needs
of this kind are certainly inadequate. For, Venerable Brethren, We almost
seem to see with Our own eyes the vast hosts of children weakened or at
death's door through starvation. They hold out their little hands asking
for bread "and there is no one to break it unto them" (Lam. 4, 4).
Without home, without clothing, they shiver in the winter cold and die.
And there are no fathers or mothers to warm and clothe them. Ailing, or
even in the last stages of consumption, they are without the necessary
medicines and medical care. We see them, too, passing before Our
sorrowful gaze, wandering through the noisy city street, reduced to
unemployment and moral corruption, or drifting as vagrants uncertainly
about the cities, the towns, the countryside, while no one--alas--
provides safe refuge for them against want, vice and crime.

<p>12. How, then, can We desist, Venerable Brethren, when We love those
children of Ours so intensely in the heart of Jesus Christ (Philip 1, 8);
how can We desist from appealing again and again to you all individually
and collectively and to all throughout the world who, like you, are
inspired with a sense of mercy and piety, so that the full force of
Christian charity--and it is a mighty force--may be pooled by willing and
generous souls in order to mitigate and relieve their piteous condition.

<p>13. Let us use all the means that modern progress offers or recommends.
Let new methods be devised which may, through the cooperation of all
provide an effective remedy for present ills and for those which are
feared in the future. Thus, may it speedily come about that with God's
help and inspiration the snares of vice, which hold so many derelict
children as an easy prey, may give way to the attraction of a virtuous
life; that their blank idleness and gloomy sloth may give way to honest
and cheerful employment; that for their hunger, starvation and nakedness
they may have adequate relief from the Divine charity of Jesus Christ,
which should be most alive, eager and strong among His followers at a
time like this.

<p>14. Such a change will contribute most effectively not only to the
increase of the Catholic Religion and of Christian virtue but also to the
good of the human family at large and of civil society. For, as all know,
there would not be such a mass of delinquents in the common jails if
greater and more suitable measures were taken to prevent especially
juvenile delinquency. And if everywhere there grew up a healthy, honest
and industrious youth, it would be easier to find citizens remarkable for
their probity, fortitude and other mental and physical qualities.

<p>15. This was Our purpose, Venerable Brethren, in writing to you this
Encyclical about so grave a question, committing to you the task of
communicating Our paternal exhortation in the way you consider most
suitable to your flocks. And We firmly trust that this, Our exhortation
and appeal, will meet with a ready answer from all and with generous
contributions and collaboration.

<p>16. Inspired by this hope, as a pledge of heavenly graces and a sign of
Our special benevolence with all affection in the Lord, We impart the
Apostolic Benediction to you all, Venerable Brethren, to the flocks
committed to your care, and especially to those who have already, in any
way, served this cause and to those who will serve it in the future.

<p>Given at St. Peter's, Rome, on the 6th day of January, Feast of the
Epiphany of Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the year 1946, the seventh of Our
Pontificate.
