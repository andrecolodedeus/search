<h1>Quo Primum</h1>  
<p><b>His Holiness Pope St. Pius V
<br>Bull Promulgated on July 14, 1570</b>

<p>Pius Bishop Servant of the Servants of God For a Perpetual Memorial of the Matter.

<p>Upon Our elevation to the Apostolic throne, We gladly turned Our mind
and energies, and directed all Our thoughts, to the matter of
preserving incorrupt the public worship of the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and We have
striven, with
<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help,
by every means in Our power to achieve that purpose.

<p>Whereas amongst other decrees of the
<a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">holy Council of Trent</a>, We were
charged with revision and re-issue of the sacred books, to wit, the
Catechism, the Missal and the Breviary; and whereas We have with God's
consent published a Catechism for the instruction of the faithful and
thoroughly revised the Breviary for the due performance of the
<a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>,
We next, in order that the Missal and Breviary might be in
perfect harmony, as is right and proper (considering that it is
altogether fitting that there should be in the Church only one
appropriate manner of Psalmody and one sole rite of celebrating
<a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>),
deemed it necessary to give Our immediate attention to what still
remained to be done, namely the re-editing of the Missal with the
least possible delay.

<p>We resolved accordingly to delegate this task to a select committee of
scholars; and they, having at every stage of their work and with the
utmost care collated the ancient codices in Our Vatican Library and
reliable (original or amended) codices from elsewhere, and having also
consulted the writing of ancient and approved authors who have
bequeathed to us records relating to the said sacred rites, thus
restored the Missal itself to the pristine form and rite of the holy
Fathers. When this production had been subjected to close scrutiny and
further amended We, after mature consideration, ordered that the final
result be forthwith printed and published in Rome, so that all may
enjoy the fruit of this labor; that priests may know what prayers to
use, and what rites and ceremonies they are to observe henceforward in
the celebration of Masses.

<p>Now therefore, in order that all everywhere may adopt and observe what
has been delivered to them by the Holy Roman Church, Mother and
Mistress of the other churches, it shall be unlawful henceforth and
forever throughout the Christian world to sing or to read Masses
according to any formula other than that of this Missal published by
Us; this ordinance to apply to all churches and chapels, with or
without
<a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">care of souls</a>,
patriarchal, collegiate, and parochial, be they
secular or belonging to any religious Order, whether of men (including
the
<a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military Orders</a>)
or of women, in which conventual Masses are or
ought to be sung aloud in choir or read privately according to the
rites and customs of the Roman Church; to apply, moreover, even if the
said churches have been in any way exempted, whether by indult of the
Apostolic See, by custom, by privilege, or even by oath or Apostolic
confirmation, or have their rights and faculties guaranteed to them in
any other way whatsoever, saving only those in which the practice of
saying Mass differently was granted over 200 years ago simultaneously
with the Apostolic See's institution and confirmation of the church,
and those in which there has prevailed a similar custom followed
continuously for a period of not less than 200 years; in which cases
We in no wise rescind their prerogatives or customs aforesaid.
Nevertheless, if this Missal which We have seen fit to publish be more
agreeable to these last, We hereby permit them to celebrate Mass
according to its rite, subject to the consent of their
<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>
or prelate, and of their whole Chapter, all else to the contrary
notwithstanding. All other churches aforesaid are hereby denied the
use of other missals, which are to be wholly and entirely rejected;
and by this present Constitution, which shall have the force of law in
perpetuity, We order and enjoin under pain of Our displeasure that
nothing be added to Our newly published Missal, nothing omitted
therefrom, and nothing whatsoever altered therein.

<p>We specifically command each and every patriarch, administrator and
all other persons of whatsoever ecclesiastical dignity, be they even
Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church or possessed of any other rank or
preeminence, and We order them by virtue of holy obedience to sing or
to read the Mass according to the rite and manner and norm herein laid
down by Us, and henceforward to discontinue and utterly discard all
other rubrics and rites of other missals, howsoever ancient, which
they have been accustomed to follow, and not to presume in celebrating
Mass to introduce any ceremonies or recite any prayers other than
those contained in this Missal.

<p>Furthermore, by these presents and by virtue of Our Apostolic
authority We give and grant in perpetuity that for the singing or
reading of Mass in any church whatsoever, this Missal may be followed
absolutely, without any scruple of conscience or fear of incurring any
penalty, judgment or censure, and may be freely and lawfully used. Nor
shall bishops, administrators, canons, chaplains, and other secular
priests, or religious of whatsoever Order or by whatsoever title
designated, be obliged to celebrate Mass otherwise than enjoined by
Us. We likewise order and declare that no one whosoever shall be
forced or coerced into altering this Missal and that this present
Constitution can never be revoked or modified, but shall for ever
remain valid and have the force of law, notwithstanding previous
constitutions or edicts of provincial or synodal councils, and
notwithstanding the usage of the churches aforesaid, established by
very long and even immemorial prescription, saving only usage of more
than 200 years.

<p>Consequently it is Our will, and by the same authority We decree, that
one month after publication of this Our constitution and Missal,
priests of the Roman Curia shall be obliged to sing or to read the
Mass in accordance therewith; others south of the Alps, after three
months; those who live beyond the Alps, after six months or as soon as
the Missal becomes available for purchase.

<p>Furthermore, in order that the said Missal may be preserved incorrupt
and kept free from defects and errors, the penalty for non-observance
in the case of all printers resident in territory directly or
indirectly subject to Ourselves and the Holy Roman Church shall be
forfeiture of their books and a fine of 100 gold ducats payable by
that very fact to the Apostolic Treasury. In the case of those
resident in other parts of the world, it shall be automatical
excommunication and other penalties at Our discretion; and by Our
Apostolic authority and the tenor of these presents, We also decree
that they must not dare or presume either to print or to publish or to
sell, or in any way to take delivery of such books without Our
approval and consent, or without express permission of the Apostolic
Commissary in the said parts appointed by Us for that purpose. Each of
the said printers must receive from the aforementioned Commissary a
standard Missal to serve as an exemplar and agree faithfully
therewith, varying in no wise from the first impression printed in Rome.

<p>But, since it would be difficult for this present Constitution to be
transmitted to all parts of the world and to come to the notice of all
concerned simultaneously, We direct that it be, as usual, posted and
published at the doors of the Basilica of the Prince of Apostles, at
those of the Apostolic Chancery, and at the end of the Campo dei
Fiori; moreover, We direct that printed copies of the same, signed by
a notary public and authenticated with the seal of an ecclesiastical
dignitary, shall possess the same unqualified and indubitable validity
everywhere and in every country that would attend the display there of
Our present text. Accordingly, no one whosoever is permitted to
infringe or rashly contravene this notice of Our permission, statute,
ordinance, command, direction, grant, indult, declaration, will,
decree and prohibition. Should any person venture to do so, let him
understand that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the
blessed Apostles <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>
and Paul.

<p>Given at St. Peter's, Rome, in the year of Our Lord's Incarnation one
thousand five hundred and seventy, on the fourteenth day of July in
the fifth year of Our Pontificate.

<p>Caesar Glorierus
