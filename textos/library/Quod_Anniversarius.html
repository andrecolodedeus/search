<h1>Quod Anniversarius</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on His Sacerdotal Jubilee
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>Promulgated on April 1, 1888</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Whole World in Favor and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>WE RETURN THANKS as is meet, to the sovereign goodness of God, Whose will
and providential wish governs the whole of men's lives, that the fiftieth
anniversary of Our priesthood has shown upon the Church. Moreover, the
wonderful unanimity of hearts displayed in the tokens of respect, the
liberal gifts, the public manifestations of readiness, is such as He alone
could have inspired, on Whom entirely depends the spirits, the wills, and
the hearts of men, and who rules and directs events for the glory of the
Christian religion.

<p>2. It is indeed a wonderful and memorable event, whereby the enemies of the
Church, in spite of themselves, whether they desire it or not, see with
their own eyes that the Church maintains her divine life, and the virtue
with which she is endowed from heaven; this indeed makes them feel that the
impious strive in vain when they rage and plan foolish attacks against the
Lord and against His Christ.

<p>3. In order that the memory of this heavenly benefit may be continued, and
that its utility may be spread as far and wide as possible, We have laid
open the treasures of heavenly graces to all the flock committed to Our
care. We have not been wanting in imploring the succors of divine mercy in
favor of those who are outside the ark of salvation whereby We hope to
obtain that all nations and all peoples, united in the faith by the bond of
charity may soon form one flock under one shepherd. This is what We have
asked of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Our supplications on the occasion of the
late solemn canonizations.

<p>4. For lifting up Our eyes towards the Church triumphant We have solemnly
decreed and accorded on the one hand the supreme honor of the Saints; on
the other the title of Blessed, to those Christian heroes, the examination
of whose sublime virtues and miracles have been happily concluded according
to due rights of law, so that the heavenly Jerusalem may be joined in a
communion of the same joy with those who still pursue on earth the
pilgrimage which is to lead them to God.

<p>5. But by the help of God, in order that We may crown this joy, We desire
to fulfill, as far as lays in Our power, Our apostolic duty of charity by
extending the plenitude of Our infinite spiritual treasures to those
beloved children of the Church who, having died the death of the just, have
quitted this world of strife with the sign of faith, and are branches of
the mystical vine, though they cannot enter into everlasting rest until
they have paid the uttermost farthing which they owe to the avenging
justice of God.

<p>6. We are moved to this both by the pious desires of Catholics to whom We
know that Our resolution will be especially grateful, and by the fearful
tortures which the souls of the departed suffer, but We are also animated
by the custom of the Church, which, amidst the most joyous solemnities of
the year, fails not to make a holy and salutary commemoration of the dead
that they may be delivered from their sins.

<p>7. Therefore, since it is certain by the doctrine of the Catholic Church,
that the souls detained in purgatory are benefited by the prayers of the
faithful, and especially by the august Sacrifice of the Altar, We think we
can give them no more useful and desirable pledge of Our love than by
everywhere increasing the offering of the pure oblation of the Most Holy
Sacrifice of Our Divine Mediator, for the extinction of their pain. We
therefore decree, with all the necessary dispensations and indulgences, the
last Sunday of next September as a day of ample expiation on which will be
celebrated by Ourselves, and equally by each of Our brethren the
Patriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops, and also by other prelates exercising
jurisdiction in a diocese, each in his own church, whether patriarchal,
metropolitan, or cathedral, a special Mass for the Dead with the greatest
solemnity possible, and according to the rite ordered in the Missal for the
Commemoration of all Souls.

<p>8. We desire also that this should take place in the same manner in all
parish and collegiate churches, both of the secular and regular clergy, and by
all priests generally, provided that they do not omit the proper office of the
Mass for the day where it is obligatory.

<p>9. As to the faithful, We strenuously exhort them after Sacramental
confession devoutly to partake of the Bread of Angels for the benefit of
the souls in purgatory. We grant by Our Apostolic authority a plenary
indulgence to be gained by such of the faithful, applicable to the dead,
and the favor of a privileged altar to all those who, as has been said
before, say Mass.

<p>10. Thus those pious souls who expiate the remainder of their sins amidst
such tortures will receive a special and opportune consolation, thanks to
the life giving Victim which the Universal Church united to her visible
head, and animated with a like spirit of charity, will offer to God that He
may admit them to the dwelling of His consolation, to light and eternal
peace.

<p>11. In the meanwhile, Venerable Brethren, We affectionately grant you in
the Lord as a pledge of celestial gifts, the Apostolic Benediction, to you
and to all the clergy and people committed to your charge.

<p>Given at St. Peter's, at Rome, at the solemnity of Easter, in the year
1888, the eleventh of our Pontificate.
