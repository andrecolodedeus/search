<h1>Redemptoris Nostri Cruciatus</h1>  
<b>His Holiness Pope Pius XII</b>
<br><b>Encyclical on the Holy Places in Palestine</b>
<br><b>April 15, 1949</b>

<p><i>To the Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Ordinaries m Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>THE PASSION OF OUR REDEEMER, rendered present, as it were to us during
these days of Holy Week, makes the minds of Christians turn with deepest
reverence to that land which Divine Providence willed to be the cherished
home-country of the Word Incarnate, and in which Christ Jesus lived His
earthly life, shed His blood and died.

<p>2. Yet at the present time, as We recall the memory of those Holy Places
with more ardent devotion, Our heart is full to overflowing with keenest
anxiety because of the difficulty and uncertainty of the situation which
there prevails.

<p>3. During this past year, We have urged you insistently, Venerable
Brethren, in successive letters, that all should join in public prayer to
implore the cessation of hostilities which have brought destruction and
death in that land, and settlement of the dispute on principles of
justice, which would fully safeguard the freedom of Catholics and at the
same time provide guarantees for the safety of those most Holy Places.

<p>4. And now that hostilities have ended, or at least have been suspended
after the recent truce, We offer Our most sincere and heartfelt thanks to
God and voice Our emphatic approval of the labor of those whose noble
efforts have contributed towards the re-establishment of peace.

<p>5. But although the actual fighting is over, tranquillity or order in
Palestine is still very far from having been restored. For We are still
receiving complaints from those who have every right to deplore the
profanation of sacred buildings, images, charitable institutions, as well
as the destruction of peaceful homes of religious communities. Piteous
appeals still reach Us from numerous refugees, of every age and
condition, who have been forced by the disastrous war to emigrate and
even live in exile in concentration camps, the prey to destitution,
contagious disease and perils of every sort.

<p>6. We are not unmindful of the considerable aid contributed by public and
private agencies for relief of these suffering thousands; and We
Ourselves, continuing the work of charity, organized from the beginning
of Our Pontificate, have left nothing undone, within Our means, to meet
the more urgent needs of this same unhappy multitude.

<p>7. But the condition of these exiles is so critical and unstable that it
cannot longer be permitted to continue. While, therefore, We encourage
all generous and noble souls to put forth their best effort to aid these
homeless people in their sorrow and destitution, We make an earnest
appeal to those responsible that justice may be rendered to all who have
been driven far from their homes by the turmoil of war and whose most
ardent desire now is to lead peaceful lives once more.

<p>8. During these holy days this is Our fondest hope, and likewise that of
all Christian peoples: that peace may finally shed its light over the
land where He, Who is called by the Sacred Prophets, "the Prince of
Peace" (Is. 9: 6) and by the Apostle of the Gentiles Peace Itself (Eph.
2: 14), lived His life and shed His blood.

<p>9. We have never ceased to pray repeatedly for this enduring and genuine
peace. And to the end that it might be brought to fruition and permanence
at the earliest possible moment, We have already insisted in Our
Encyclical letter In Multiplicibus, that the time has come when Jerusalem
and its vicinity, where the previous memorials of the Life and Death of
the Divine Redeemer are preserved, should be accorded and legally
guaranteed an "international" status, which in the present circumstances
seems to offer the best and most satisfactory protection for these sacred
monuments.

<p>10. We cannot help repeating here the same declaration, encouraged by the
thought that it may also serve as an inspiration to Our children. Let
them, wherever they are living, use every legitimate means to persuade
the rulers of nations, and those whose duty it is to settle this
important question, to accord to Jerusalem and its surroundings a
juridical status whose stability under the present circumstances can only
be adequately assured by a united effort of nations that love peace and
respect the right of others.

<p>11. Besides, it is of the utmost importance that due immunity and
protection be guaranteed to all the Holy Places of Palestine not only in
Jerusalem but also in the other cities and villages as well.

<p>12. Not a few of these places have suffered serious loss and damage owing
to the upheaval and devastation of the war. Since they are religious
memorials of such moment--objects of veneration to the whole world and an
incentive and support to Christian piety--these places should also be
suitably protected by definite statute guaranteed by an "international"
agreement.

<p>13. We are well aware of the intense desire of Our children, following
the ancient tradition, to go on pilgrimage once more to these places from
which they were barred by the general disturbed conditions. The Year of
Atonement which is at hand increases all the more these desires; it is
only natural that during this period the faithful should be more eager
than ever to visit that land which was the scene of our Divine
Redemption. God grant that these longings be satisfied as soon as
possible.

<p>14. To bring about this happy result, it will be necessary, or course, to
make such arrangements as will allow pilgrims to approach freely those
sacred edifices; enabling each to profess his devotion openly and without
hindrance, and to remain there free from fear and danger. It must also be
considered objectionable that pilgrims should see these places profaned
by sinful and worldly entertainments, which are assuredly an offense to
the Divine Redeemer and to the Christian conscience.

<p>15. Moreover, We very much desire that the many Catholic institutions
which have been erected in Palestine to help the poor, to educate youth
and give hospitality to visitors, may be enabled, as is fitting, to carry
on unimpeded the work they did so laudably in the past.

<p>16. Nor can We omit to point out that all rights to the Holy Places,
which Catholics during many centuries have acquired and time and again
defended valiantly, and which Our predecessors have solemnly and
effectively vindicated, should be preserved inviolate. These, Venerable
Brethren, are the considerations We wished to put before you.

<p>17. Encourage the faithful committed to your charge to be ever more
concerned about the conditions in Palestine and have them make their
lawful requests known, positively and unequivocally, to the rulers of
nations. But let them especially implore unceasingly the help of Him, Who
is the Ruler of Men and Nations. May God look down with mercy on the
whole world, but particularly on that land which was bedewed with the
Blood of the Incarnate Word, so that the charity of Jesus Christ, which
alone can bring tranquillity and peace, may conquer all hatred and strife.

<p>18. Meantime, may the Apostolic Blessing, which We lovingly impart to
you, Venerable Brethren, and to all your flock, be a pledge of heavenly
gifts and a token of our affection.

<p>Given at Rome, St. Peter's the fifteenth day of the month of April, Good
Friday, in the year 1949, the eleventh of Our Pontificate.
