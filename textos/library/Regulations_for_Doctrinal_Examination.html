<h1>Regulations for Doctrinal Examination</h1>  
<p><b>Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith<br>June 29, 1997</b>

<p><i>Article 1.</i>
The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has the function
of promoting and safeguarding doctrine on faith and morals
throughout the Catholic world. In accomplishing this purpose, it
renders a service to the truth, by protecting the right of the People of
God to receive the Gospel message in its purity and entirety.
Therefore, in order that faith and morals not be harmed by errors
however disseminated, it also has the duty of examining writings and
opinions which appear contrary to correct faith or dangerous.

<p><i>Article 2.</i>
This fundamental pastoral responsibility concerns all pastors
of the Church, who have the duty and the right to exercise vigilance,
whether individually or gathered in particular Councils or Episcopal
Conferences, in order that the faith and morals of the members of the
faithful entrusted to their care not suffer harm. To this end, they can
also be served by Doctrinal Commissions, institutionalized
consultative bodies which assist Episcopal Conferences and individual
Bishops in their solicitude for the doctrine of the faith. The principle
remains, however, that the Holy See can always intervene and, as a
rule, does so when the influence of a publication exceeds the
boundaries of an individual Episcopal Conference, or when the
danger to the faith is particularly grave. In such cases, the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith uses the following
procedures:

<p align=center><b>I. Preliminary Examination</b></p>

<p><i>Article 3.</i>
 The indicated writings or teachings, in whatever way they are
disseminated, are given attention by the competent Office, which
submits them to the examination of the Congresso [the weekly
meeting of the Superiors and Officials of the Congregation]. After a
preliminary evaluation of the gravity of the question, the Congresso
decides whether or not to undertake a study by the Office.

<p align=center><b>II. Office Study</b></p>

<p><i>Article 4.</i>
 Once the authenticity of the writings has been verified, it is
carefully examined with the collaboration of one or more Consultors
or other experts in the particular area.

<p><i>Article 5.</i>
 The outcome of this examination is then presented to the
Congresso, which decides whether this is sufficient for an
intervention with the local authorities, or whether the examination
needs to proceed further by one of two established procedures:
ordinary examination or examination in cases of urgency.

<p><i>Article 6.</i>
 Should the Congresso judge that the study undertaken was
sufficient, it can entrust the case directly to the author's Ordinary
and, through him, bring the doctrinal problems presented in the text
to the author's attention. In such a case, the Ordinary is invited to
deepen the study of the question and ask the author to provide the
needed clarifications for submission to the judgment of the Congregation.

<p align=center><b>III. Ordinary Procedure for Examination</b></p>

<p><i>Article 8.</i>
 An ordinary examination is used when a writing appears to
contain grave doctrinal error, the identification of which requires
attentive discernment, and the possible negative influence on the
faithful does not seem to involve particular urgency. The
examination is structured in two phases: an internal phase of
preliminary investigation undertaken within the Congregation and an
external phase involving the presentation of objections to the author
and subsequent dialogue.

<p><i>Article 9.</i>
 The Congresso designates two or more experts who examine
the text in question, give their opinions, and evaluate whether it is in
conformity with the doctrine of the Church.

<p><i>Article 10.</i>
 The same Congresso appoints a <i>relator pro auctore</i>, who has
the task of illustrating, in a spirit of truth, the positive aspects of the
teaching and the merits of the author, of cooperating in the authentic
interpretation of his thought within the overall theological context,
and of expressing a judgment regarding the influence of the author's
opinions. For this purpose, the <i>relator pro auctore</i> has the right to
examine all the acts relative to the case.

<p><i>Article 11.</i>
 The Office Report, which contains all the information
relevant to the examination of the case (including the antecedent
elements), the opinions of the experts and the presentation of the
<i>relator pro auctore</i>, is distributed to those who will take part in the
Consultation.

<p><i>Article 12.</i>
 The experts who had submitted opinions on the text can also
be invited to participate in the Consultation-- in addition to the
Consultors themselves, the <i>relator pro auctore</i> and the author's
Ordinary (who cannot be substituted by another and is bound to
secrecy). The discussion begins with an exposition by the <i>relator pro
auctore</i>, who makes a comprehensive presentation of the case. After
him, the author's Ordinary, the experts, and the Consultors each
express their own opinion, orally and in writing, on the content of the
text under examination. The <i>relator pro auctore</i> and the experts may
respond to the observations and offer clarifications.

<p><i>Article 13.</i>
 When the discussion has finished, the Consultors alone
remain in the room for the general vote on the outcome of the
examination, aimed at determining whether doctrinal errors or
dangerous opinions have been found in the text, and specifically
identifying these in light of the different categories of truth-
propositions found in the Professio fidei.

<p><i>Article 14.</i>
 The entire file, including the minutes of the discussion, the
general vote and the opinions of the Consultors, is submitted to the
examination of the Ordinary Session of the Congregation, which
decides whether to present objections to the author, and if so, on
which points.

<p><i>Article 15.</i>
 The decisions of Ordinary Sessions are submitted to the
consideration of the Supreme Pontiff.

<p><i>Article 16.</i>
 If, in the prior phase, it was decided to proceed to a
presentation of objections, the author's Ordinary or other concerned
Ordinaries, as well as the competent Dicasteries of the Holy See, are
informed.

<p><i>Article 17.</i>
 The list of erroneous or dangerous propositions at issue,
together with an explanatory argumentation and the documentation
(reticito nomine) necessary for the defense, are communicated
through the Ordinary to the author and his advisor, whom the author
has the right to nominate, with the approval of his Ordinary, to assist
him. The author must present a written response within three
canonical months. It is appropriate that, together with the author's
response, the Ordinary also forwards his own opinion to the
Congregation.

<p><i>Article 18.</i>
 The possibility is also foreseen of a personal meeting
between the author, assisted by his adviser (who takes an active part
in the discussion) and delegates of the Congregation. In this
eventuality, the Congregation's delegates, who are appointed by the
Congresso, are to keep minutes of the meeting, the text of which is to
be signed by them, by the author and by his advisor.

<p><i>Article 19.</i>
 Should the author not send the written response, as is
always requested, the Ordinary Session of the Congregation takes the
appropriate decisions.

<p><i>Article 20.</i>
 The Congresso examines the written response of the author
as well as the minutes of any meeting that has taken place. If this
examination reveals truly new doctrinal elements requiring further
evaluation, it is then decided whether the question should again be
presented to the Consultation, which may be expanded to include
additional experts, among these the author's advisor, appointed in
accordance with article 17. Otherwise, the written response of the
author and the minutes of any meeting are submitted directly to the
judgment of the Ordinary Session.

<p><i>Article 21.</i>
 If the Ordinary Session decides that the question has been
resolved positively and that the response is sufficient, the process
does not go further. Should this not be the case, adequate measures
are then taken, also for the good of the faithful. Moreover, the
Ordinary Session decides whether and in what way the results of the
examination are to be made public.

<p><i>Article 22.</i>
 The decisions of the Ordinary Session are submitted for the
approval of the Supreme Pontiff and then communicated to the
author's Ordinary, to the Episcopal Conference and to concerned
Dicasteries.

<p align=center><b>IV. Examination in Cases of Urgency</b></p>

<p><i>Article 23.</i>
 An urgent examination is employed when the writing is
clearly and certainly erroneous and, at the same time, its
dissemination could cause or already has caused grave harm to the
faithful. In this case, the Ordinary or the concerned Ordinaries are
immediately informed together with the competent Dicasteries of the
Holy See.

<p><i>Article 24.</i>
 The Congresso appoints a commission which is especially
entrusted with promptly determining the erroneous or dangerous
propositions.

<p><i>Article 25.</i>
 The propositions identified by the Commission, together with
the relative documentation, are submitted to the Ordinary Session,
which will give priority to the examination of the question.

<p><i>Article 26.</i>
 If the Ordinary Session judges that the above-mentioned
propositions are in fact erroneous and dangerous, after the approval
of the Holy Father, they are transmitted to the author, through his
Ordinary, with the request that they be corrected within two
canonical months.

<p><i>Article 27.</i>
 If the Ordinary, having heard the author, believes it is
necessary to ask him also for a written explanation, this text must be
forwarded to the Congregation together with the opinion of the
Ordinary. Such an explanation is then presented to the Ordinary
Session for the appropriate decisions.

<p align=center><b>V. Disciplinary Measures</b></p>

<p><i>Article 28.</i>
 If the author has not corrected the indicated errors in a
satisfactory way and with adequate publicity, and the Ordinary
Session has concluded that he has committed the offense of heresy,
apostasy, or schism, the Congregation proceeds to declare the <i>latae
sententiae</i> penalties incurred; against such a declaration no recourse
is admitted.

<p><i>Article 29.</i>
 If the Ordinary Session ascertains the existence of doctrinal
errors which do not involve <i>latae sententiae</i> penalties, the
Congregation proceeds, according to the norm of law, whether
universal or proper to the Congregation.

<p>The Sovereign Pontiff John Paul II, at the Audience granted to the
undersigned Prefect on May 30, 1997, confirmed these Regulations,
adopted in the Ordinary Session of this Congregation, approving at
the same time <i>in forma specifica</i> articles 28-29, <i>contrariis
quibuslibet non ostantibus</i>, and ordered their publication.

<p>Rome, from the Offices of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the
Faith, June 29, 1997, the Solemnity of the Blessed Apostles Peter and
Paul.

<p>+ Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger
<br><i>Prefect</i>

<p>+ Tarcisio Bertone
<br><i>Archbishop Emeritus of Vercelli</i>
<br><i>Secretary</i>
