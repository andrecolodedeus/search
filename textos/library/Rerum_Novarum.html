<h1>Rerum Novarum</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical Letter on the Condition of the Working Classes
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>May 15, 1891</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops and other Ordinaries of Places Having Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren: Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>ONCE THE PASSION for revolutionary change was aroused -- a
passion long disturbing governments -- it was bound to follow
sooner or later that eagerness for change would pass from the
political sphere over into the related field of economics. In
fact, new developments in industry, new techniques striking out
on new paths, changed relations of employer and employee,
abounding wealth among a very small number and destitution among
the masses, increased self-reliance on the part of workers as
well as a closer bond of union with one another, and, in addition
to all this, a decline in morals have caused conflict to break
forth.

<p>2. The momentous nature of the questions involved in this
conflict is evident from the fact that it keeps men's minds in
anxious expectation, occupying the talents of the learned, the
discussions of the wise and experienced, the assemblies of the
people, the judgment of lawmakers, and the deliberations of
rulers, so that now no topic more strongly holds men's interests.

<p>3. Therefore, Venerable Brethren, with the cause of the Church
and the common welfare before Us, We have thought it advisable,
following Our custom on other occasions when We issued to you the
Encyclicals "On Political Power", "On Human Liberty", "On the
Christian Constitution of States", and others of similar nature,
which seemed opportune to refute erroneous opinions, that We
ought to do the same now, and for the same reasons, "On the
Condition of Workers." We have on occasion touched more than
once upon this subject. In this Encyclical, however,
consciousness of Our Apostolic office admonishes Us to treat the
entire question thoroughly, in order that the principles may
stand out in clear light, and the conflict may thereby be brought
to an end as required by truth and equity.

<p>4. The problem is difficult to resolve and is not free from
dangers. It is hard indeed to fix the boundaries of the rights
and duties within which the rich and the proletariat -- those who
furnish material things and those who furnish work -- ought to be
restricted in relation to each other. The controversy is truly
dangerous, for in various places it is being twisted by turbulent
and crafty men to pervert judgment as to truth and seditiously to
incite the masses.

<p>5. In any event, We see clearly, and all are agreed that the
poor must be speedily and fittingly cared for, since the great
majority of them live undeservedly in miserable and wretched
conditions.

<p>6. After the old trade guilds had been destroyed in the last
century, and no protection was substituted in their place, and
when public institutions and legislation had cast off traditional
religious teaching, it gradually came about that the present age
handed over the workers, each alone and defenseless, to the
inhumanity of employers and the unbridled greed of competitors.
A devouring usury, although often condemned by the Church, but
practiced nevertheless under another form by avaricious and
grasping men, has increased the evil; and in addition the whole
process of production as well as trade in every kind of goods has
been brought almost entirely under the power of a few, so that a
very few rich and exceedingly rich men have laid a yoke almost of
slavery on the unnumbered masses of non-owning workers.

<p>7. To cure this evil, the Socialists, exciting the envy of the
poor toward the rich, contend that it is necessary to do away
with private possession of goods and in its place to make the
goods of individuals common to all, and that the men who preside
over a municipality or who direct the entire State should act as
administrators of these goods. They hold that, by such a
transfer of private goods from private individuals to the
community, they can cure the present evil through dividing wealth
and benefits equally among the citizens.

<p>8. But their program is so unsuited for terminating the conflict
that it actually injures the workers themselves. Moreover, it is
highly unjust, because it violates the rights of lawful owners,
perverts the function of the State, and throws governments into
utter confusion.

<p>9. Clearly the essential reason why those who engage in any
gainful occupation undertake labor, and at the same time the end
to which workers immediately look, is to procure property for
themselves and to retain it by individual right as theirs and as
their very own. When the worker places his energy and his labor
at the disposal of another, he does so for the purpose of getting
the means necessary for livelihood. He seeks in return for the
work done, accordingly, a true and full right not only to demand
his wage but to dispose of it as he sees fit. Therefore, if he
saves something by restricting expenditures and invests his
savings in a piece of land in order to keep the fruit of his
thrift more safe, a holding of this kind is certainly nothing
else than his wage under a different form; and on this account
land which the worker thus buys is necessarily under his full
control as much as the wage which he earned by his labor. But,
as is obvious, it is clearly in this that the ownership of
movable and immovable goods consists. Therefore, inasmuch as the
Socialists seek to transfer the goods of private persons to the
community at large, they make the lot of all wage earners worse,
because in abolishing the freedom to dispose of wages they take
away from them by this very act the hope and the opportunity of
increasing their property and of securing advantages for
themselves.

<p>10. But, what is of more vital concern, they propose a remedy
openly in conflict with justice, inasmuch as nature confers on
man the right to possess things privately as his own.

<p>11. In this respect also there is the widest difference between
man and other living beings. For brute beasts are not self-ruling, but are ruled and governed by a two-fold innate instinct,
which not only keeps their faculty of action alert and develops
their powers properly but also impels and determines their
individual movements. By one instinct they are induced to
protect themselves and their lives; by the other, to preserve
their species. In truth, they attain both ends readily by using
what is before them and within immediate range; and they cannot,
of course, go further because they are moved to action by the
senses alone and by the separate things perceived by the senses.
 Man's nature is quite different. In man there is likewise
the entire and full perfection of animal nature, and consequently
on this ground there is given to man, certainly no less than to
every kind of living being, to enjoy the benefits of corporeal
goods. Yet animal nature, however perfectly possessed, is far
from embracing human nature, but rather is much lower than human
nature, having been created to serve and obey it. What stands
out and excels in us, what makes man man and distinguishes him
generically from the brute, is the mind and reason. And owing to
the fact that this animal alone has reason, it is necessary that
man have goods not only to be used, which is common to all living
things, but also to be possessed by stable and perpetual right;
and this applies not merely to those goods which are consumed by
use, but to those also which endure after being used.

<p>12. This is even more clearly evident, if the essential nature of
human beings is examined more closely. Since man by his reason
understands innumerable things, linking and combining the future
with the present, and since he is master of his own actions,
therefore, under the eternal law, and under the power of God most
wisely ruling all things, he rules himself by the foresight of
his own counsel. Wherefore it is in his power to choose the
things which he considers best adapted to benefit him not only in
the present but also in the future. Whence it follows that
dominion not only over the fruits of the earth, but also over the
earth itself, ought to rest in man, since he sees that things
necessary for the future are furnished him out of the produce of
the earth. The needs of every man are subject, as it were, to
constant recurrences, so that, satisfied today, they make new
demands tomorrow. Therefore, nature necessarily gave man
something stable and perpetually lasting on which he can count
for continuous support. But nothing can give continuous support
of this kind save the earth with its great abundance.

<p>13. There is no reason to interpose provision by the State, for
man is older than the State. Wherefore he had to possess by
nature his own right to protect his life and body before any
polity had been formed.

<p>14. The fact that God gave the whole human race the earth to use
and enjoy cannot indeed in any manner serve as an objection
against private possessions. For God is said to have given the
earth to mankind in common, not because He intended
indiscriminate ownership of it by all, but because He assigned no
part to anyone in ownership, leaving the limits of private
possessions to be fixed by the industry of men and the
institutions of peoples. Yet, however the earth may be
apportioned among private owners, it does not cease to serve the
common interest of all, inasmuch as no living being is sustained
except by what the fields bring forth. Those who lack resources
supply labor, so that it can be truly affirmed that the entire
scheme of securing a livelihood consists in the labor which a
person expends either on his own land or in some working
occupation, the compensation for which is drawn ultimately from
no other source than from the varied products of the earth and is
exchanged for them.

<p>15. For this reason it also follows that private possessions are
clearly in accord with nature. The earth indeed produces in
great abundance the things to preserve and, especially, to
perfect life, but of itself it could not produce them without
human cultivation and care. Moreover, since man expends his
mental energy and his bodily strength in procuring the goods of
nature, by this very act he appropriates that part of physical
nature to himself which he has cultivated. On it he leaves
impressed, as it were, a kind of image of his person, so that it
must be altogether just that he should possess that part as his
very own and that no one in any way should be permitted to
violate his right.

<p>16. The force of these arguments is so evident that it seems
amazing that certain revivers of obsolete theories dissent from
them. These men grant the individual the use of the soil and the
varied fruits of the farm, but absolutely deny him the right to
hold as owner either the ground on which he has built or the farm
he has cultivated. When they deny this right they fail to see
that a man will be defrauded of the things his labor has
produced. The land, surely, that has been worked by the hand and
the art of the tiller greatly changes in aspect. The wilderness
is made fruitful; the barren field, fertile. But those things
through which the soil has been improved so inhere in the soil
and are so thoroughly intermingled with it, that they are for the
most part quite inseparable from it. And, after all, would
justice permit anyone to own and enjoy that upon which another
has toiled? As effects follow the cause producing them, so it is
just that the fruit of labor belongs precisely to those who have
performed the labor.

<p>17. Rightly therefore, the human race as a whole, moved in no
wise by the dissenting opinions of a few, and observing nature
carefully, has found in the law of nature itself the basis of the
distribution of goods, and, by the practice of all ages, has
consecrated private possession as something best adapted to man's
nature and to peaceful and tranquil living together. Now civil
laws, which, when just, derive their power from the natural law
itself, confirm and, even by the use of force, protect this right
of which we speak. -- And this same right has been sanctioned by
the authority of the divine law, which forbids us most strictly
even to desire what belongs to another. "Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his
maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his." [1]

<p>18. Rights of this kind which reside in individuals are seen to
have much greater validity when viewed as fitted into and
connected with the obligations of human beings in family life.

<p>19. There is no question that in choosing a state of life it is
within the power and discretion of individuals to prefer the one
or the other state, either to follow the counsel of Jesus Christ
regarding virginity or to bind oneself in marriage. No law of
man can abolish the natural and primeval right of marriage, or in
any way set aside the chief purpose of matrimony established in
the beginning by the authority of God: "Increase and multiply."
[2] Behold, therefore, the family, or rather the society of the
household, a very small society indeed, but a true one, and older
than any polity! For that reason it must have certain rights and
duties of its own independent of the State. Thus, right of
ownership, which we have shown to be bestowed on individual
persons by nature, must be assigned to man in his capacity as
head of a family. Nay rather, this right is all the stronger,
since the human person in family life embraces much more.

<p>20. It is a most sacred law of nature that the father of a family
see that his offspring are provided with all the necessities of
life, and nature even prompts him to desire to provide and to
furnish his children, who, in fact reflect and in a sense
continue his person, with the means of decently protecting
themselves against harsh fortune in the uncertainties of life.
He can do this surely in no other way than by owning fruitful
goods to transmit by inheritance to his children. As already
noted, the family like the State is by the same token a society
in the strictest sense of the term, and is governed by its own
proper authority, namely, by that of the father. Wherefore,
assuming, of course, that those limits be observed which are
fixed by its immediate purpose, the family assuredly possesses
rights, at least equal with those of civil society, in respect to
choosing and employing the things necessary for its protection
and its just liberty. We say "at least equal" because, inasmuch
as domestic living together is prior both in thought and in fact
to uniting into a polity, it follows that its rights and duties
are also prior and more in conformity with nature. But if
citizens, if families, after becoming participants in common life
and society, were to experience injury in a commonwealth instead
of help, impairment of their rights instead of protection,
society would be something to be repudiated rather than to be
sought for.

<p>21. To desire, therefore, that the civil power should enter
arbitrarily into the privacy of homes is a great and pernicious
error. If a family perchance is in such extreme difficulty and
is so completely without plans that it is entirely unable to help
itself, it is right that the distress by remedied by public aid,
for each individual family is a part of the community.
Similarly, if anywhere there is a grave violation of mutual
rights within the family walls, public authority shall restore to
each his right; for this is not usurping the rights of citizens,
but protecting and confirming them with just and due care. Those
in charge of public affairs, however, must stop here; nature
does not permit them to go beyond these limits. Paternal
authority is such that it can be neither abolished nor absorbed
by the State, because it has the same origin in common with that
of man's own life. "Children are a part of their father," and,
as it were, a kind of extension of the father's person; and,
strictly speaking, not through themselves, but through the medium
of the family society in which they are begotten, they enter into
the participate in civil society. And for the very reason that
children "are by nature part of their father . . . before they have
the use of free will, they are kept under the care of their
parents." [3] Inasmuch as the Socialists, therefore, disregard
care by parents and in its place introduce care by the State,
they act <i>against natural justice</i> and dissolve the structure of
the home.

<p>22. And apart from the injustice involved, it is only too evident
what turmoil and disorder would obtain among all classes; and
what a harsh and odious enslavement of citizens would result!
The door would be open to mutual envy, detraction, and
dissension. If incentives to ingenuity and skill in individual
persons were to be abolished, the very fountains of wealth would
necessarily dry up; and the equality conjured up by the
Socialist imagination would, in reality, be nothing but uniform
wretchedness and meanness for one and all, without distinction.

<p>23. From all these conversations, it is perceived that the
fundamental principle of Socialism which would make all
possessions public property is to be utterly rejected because it
injures the very ones whom it seeks to help, contravenes the
natural rights of individual persons, and throws the functions of
the State and public peace into confusion. Let it be regarded,
therefore, as established that in seeking help for the masses
this principle before all is to be considered as basic, namely,
that private ownership must be preserved inviolate. With this
understood, we shall explain whence the desired remedy is to be
sought.

<p>24. We approach the subject with confidence and surely by Our
right, for the question under consideration is certainly one for
which no satisfactory solution will be found unless religion and
the Church have been called upon to aid. Moreover, since the
safeguarding of religion and of all things within the
jurisdiction of the Church is primarily Our stewardship, silence
on Our part might be regarded as failure in Our duty.

<p>25. Assuredly, a question as formidable as this requires the
attention and effort of others as well, namely, the heads of the
State, employers and the rich, and finally, those in whose behalf
efforts are being made, the workers themselves. Yet without
hesitation We affirm that if the Church is disregarded, human
striving will be in vain. Manifestly, it is the Church which
draws from the Gospel the teachings through which the struggle
can be composed entirely, or, after its bitterness is removed,
can certainly become more tempered. It is the Church, again,
that strives not only to instruct the mind but to regulate by her
precepts the life and morals of individuals, that ameliorates the
condition of the workers through her numerous and beneficent
institutions, and that wishes and aims to have the thought and
energy of all classes of society united to this end, that the
interests of the workers be protected as fully as possible. And
to accomplish this purpose she holds that the laws and the
authority of the State, within reasonable limits, ought to be
employed.

<p>26. Therefore, let it be laid down in the first place that a
condition of human existence must be borne with, namely, that in
civil society the lowest cannot be made equal to the highest.
Socialists, of course, agitate the contrary, but all struggling
against nature is vain. There are truly very great and very many
natural differences among men. Neither the talents, nor the
skill, nor the health, nor the capacities of all are the same,
and unequal fortune follows of itself upon necessary inequality
in respect to these endowments. And clearly this condition of
things is adapted to benefit both individuals and the community;
for to carry on its affairs community life requires varied
aptitudes and diverse services, and to perform these diverse
services men are impelled most by differences in individual
property holdings.

<p>27. So far as bodily labor is concerned, man even before the Fall
was not destined to be wholly idle; but certainly what his will
at that time would have freely embraced to his soul's delight,
necessity afterwards forced him to accept, with a feeling of
irksomeness, for the expiation of his guilt. "Cursed be the
earth in thy work: in thy labor thou shalt eat of it all the days
of thy life." [4] Likewise there is to be no end on earth of
other hardships, for the evil consequences of sin are hard,
trying, and bitter to bear, and will necessarily accompany men
even to the end of life. Therefore, to suffer and endure is
human, and although men may strive in all possible ways, they
will never be able by any power or art wholly to banish such
tribulations from human life. If any claim they can do this, if
they promise the poor in their misery a life free from all sorrow
and vexation and filled with repose and perpetual pleasures, they
actually impose upon these people and perpetuate a fraud which
will ultimately lead to evils greater than the present. The best
course is to view human affairs as they are and, as We have
stated, at the same time to seek appropriate relief for these
troubles elsewhere.

<p>28. It is a capital evil with respect to the question We are
discussing to take for granted that the one class of society is
of itself hostile to the other, as if nature had set rich and
poor against each other to fight fiercely in implacable war.
This is so abhorrent to reason and truth that the exact opposite
is true; for just as in the human body the different members
harmonize with one another, whence arises that disposition of
parts and proportion in the human figure rightly called symmetry,
so likewise nature has commanded in the case of the State that
the two classes mentioned should agree harmoniously and should
properly form equally balanced counterparts to each other. Each
needs the other completely: neither capital can do without
labor, nor labor without capital. Concord begets beauty and
order in things. Conversely, from perpetual strife there must
arise disorder accompanied by bestial cruelty. But for putting
an end to conflict and for cutting away its very roots, there is
wondrous and multiple power in Christian institutions.

<p>29. And first and foremost, the entire body of religious teaching
and practice, of which the Church is interpreter and guardian,
can preeminently bring together and unite the rich and the poor
by recalling the two classes of society to their mutual duties,
and in particular to those duties which derive from justice.

<p>30. Among these duties the following concern the poor and the
workers: To perform entirely and conscientiously whatever work
has been voluntarily and equitably agreed upon; not in any way
to injure the property or to harm the person of employers; in
protecting their own interests, to refrain from violence and
never to engage in rioting; not to associate with vicious men
who craftily hold out exaggerated hopes and make huge promises, a
course usually ending in vain regrets and in the destruction of
wealth.

<p>31. The following duties, on the other hand, concern rich men and
employers: Workers are not to be treated as slaves; justice
demands that the dignity of human personality be respected in
them, ennobled as it has been through what we call the Christian
character. If we hearken to natural reason and to Christian
philosophy, gainful occupations are not a mark of shame to man,
but rather of respect, as they provide him with an honorable
means of supporting life. It is shameful and inhuman, however,
to use men as things for gain and to put no more value on them
than what they are worth in muscle and energy. Likewise it is
enjoined that the religious interests and the spiritual well-being of the workers receive proper consideration. Wherefore, it
is the duty of employers to see that the worker is free for
adequate periods to attend to his religious obligations; not to
expose anyone to corrupting influences or the enticements of sin,
and in no way to alienate him from care for his family and the
practice of thrift. Likewise, more work is not to be imposed
than strength can endure, nor that kind of work which is unsuited
to a worker's age or sex.

<p>32. Among the most important duties of employers the principal
one is to give every worker what is justly due him. Assuredly,
to establish a rule of pay in accord with justice, many factors
must be taken into account. But, in general, the rich and
employers must remember that no laws, either human or divine,
permit them for their own profit to oppress the needy and the
wretched or to seek gain from another's want. To defraud anyone
of the wage due him is a great crime that calls down avenging
wrath from Heaven, "Behold, the wages of the laborers . . . which
have been kept back by you unjustly, cry out: and their cry has
entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts." [5] Finally, the
rich must religiously avoid harming in any way the savings of the
workers either by coercion, or by fraud, or by the arts of usury;
and the more for this reason, that the workers are not
sufficiently protected against injustices and violence, and their
property, being so meager, ought to be regarded as all the
more sacred. Could not the observance alone of the foregoing
laws remove the bitterness and the causes of the conflict?

<p>33. But the Church, with Jesus Christ as her teacher and leader,
seeks greater things than this; namely, by commanding something
more perfect, she aims at joining the two social classes to each
other in closest neighborliness and friendship. We cannot
understand and evaluate mortal things rightly unless the mind
reflects upon the other life, the life which is immortal. If
this other life indeed were taken away, the form and true notion
of the right would immediately perish; nay, this entire world
would become an enigma insoluble to man. Therefore, what we
learn from nature itself as our teacher is also a Christian dogma
and on it the whole system and structure of religion rests, as it
were, on its main foundation; namely, that, when we have left
this life, only then shall we truly begin to live. God has not
created man for the fragile and transitory things of this world,
but for Heaven and eternity, and He has ordained this earth as a
place of exile, not as our permanent home. Whether you abound
in, or whether you lack, riches, and all the other things which
are called good, is of no importance in relation to eternal
happiness. But how you use them, that is truly of utmost
importance. Jesus Christ by His "plentiful redemption" has by no
means taken away the various tribulations with which mortal life
is interwoven, but has so clearly transformed them into
incentives in virtue and sources of merit that no mortal can
attain eternal reward unless he follows the bloodstained
footsteps of Jesus Christ. "If we endure, we shall also reign
with Him." [6] By the labors and suffering which He voluntarily
accepted, He has wondrously lightened the burden of suffering and
labor, and not only by His example but also by His grace and by
holding before us the hope of eternal reward. He has made
endurance of sorrows easier: "for our present light affliction,
which is for the moment, prepares us for an eternal weight of
glory that is beyond all measure." [7]

<p>34. Therefore, the well-to-do are admonished that wealth does not
give surcease of sorrow, and that wealth is of no avail unto the
happiness of eternal life but is rather a hindrance; [8] that
the threats [9] pronounced by Jesus Christ, so unusual coming
from Him, ought to cause the rich to fear; and that on one day
the strictest account for the use of wealth must be rendered to
God as Judge.

<p>35. On the use of wealth we have the excellent and extremely
weighty teaching, which, although found in a rudimentary stage in
pagan philosophy, the Church has handed down in a completely
developed form and causes to be observed not only in theory but
in everyday life. The foundation of this teaching rests on this,
that the just ownership of money is distinct from the just use of
money.

<p>36. To own goods privately, as We saw above, is a right natural
to man, and to exercise this right, especially in life in
society, is not only lawful, but clearly necessary. "It is
lawful for man to own his own things. It is even necessary for
human life." [10] But if the question be asked: How ought man
to use his possessions? the Church replies without hesitation:
"As to this point, man ought not regard external goods as his
own, but as common so that, in fact, a person should readily
share them when he sees others in need. Wherefore the Apostle
says: 'Charge the rich of this world . . . to give readily, to share
with others'." [11] No one, certainly, is obliged to assist
others out of what is required for his own necessary use or for
that of his family, or even to give to others what he himself
needs to maintain his station in life becomingly and decently:
"No one is obliged to live unbecomingly." [12] But when the
demands of necessity and propriety have been met, it is a duty to
give to the poor out of that which remains. "Give that which
remains as alms." [13] These are duties not of justice, except
in cases of extreme need, but of Christian charity, which
obviously cannot be enforced by legal action. But the laws and
judgments of men yield precedence to the law and judgment of
Christ the Lord, Who in many ways urges the practice of almsgiving:
"It is more blessed to give than to receive," [14] and
Who will judge a kindness done or denied to the poor as done or
denied to Himself, "As long as you did it for one of these, the
least of My brethren, you did it for Me." [15] The substance of
all this is the following: whoever has received from the bounty
of God a greater share of goods, whether corporeal and external,
or of the soul, has received them for this purpose, namely, that
he employ them for his own perfection and, likewise, as a servant
of Divine Providence, for the benefit of others. "Therefore, he
that hath talent, let him constantly see to it that he be not
silent; he that hath an abundance of goods, let him be on the
watch that he grow not slothful in the generosity of mercy; he
that hath a trade whereby he supports himself, let him be
especially eager to share with his neighbor the use and benefit
thereof." [16]

<p>37. Those who lack fortune's goods are taught by the Church that,
before God as judge, poverty is no disgrace, and that no one
should be ashamed because he makes his living by toil. And Jesus
Christ has confirmed this by fact and by deed, Who for the
salvation of men, "being rich, became poor;" [17] and although He
was the Son of God and God Himself, yet He willed to seem and to
be thought the son of a carpenter; nay, He even did not disdain
to spend a great part of his life at the work of a carpenter.
"Is not this the carpenter, the Son of Mary?" [18] Those who
contemplate this Divine example will more easily understand these
truths: True dignity and excellence in men resides in moral
living, that is, in virtue; virtue is the common inheritance of
man, attainable equally by the humblest and the mightiest, by the
rich and the poor; and the reward of eternal happiness will
follow upon virtue and merit alone, regardless of the person in
whom they may be found. Nay, rather the favor of God Himself
seems to incline more toward the unfortunate as a class; for
Jesus Christ calls the poor [19] blessed, and He invites most
lovingly all who are in labor or sorrow [20] to come to Him for
solace, embracing with special love the lowly and those harassed
by injustice. At the realization of these things the proud
spirit of the rich is easily brought down, and the downcast heart
of the afflicted is lifted up; the former are moved toward
kindness, the latter toward reasonableness in their demands.
Thus the distance between the classes which pride seeks is
seduced, and it will easily be brought to pass that the two
classes, with hands clasped in friendship, will be united in
heart.

<p>38. Yet, if they obey Christian teachings, not merely friendship
but brotherly love also will bind them to each other. They will
feel and understand that all men indeed have been created by God,
their common Father; that all strive for the same object of
good, which is God Himself, Who alone can communicate to both men
and angels perfect and absolute happiness; that all equally have
been redeemed by the grace of Jesus Christ and restored to the
dignity of the sons of God, so that they are clearly united by
the bonds of brotherhood not only with one another but also with
Christ the Lord, "the first-born among many brethren," [21] and
further, that the goods of nature and the gifts of divine grace
belong in common and without distinction to all human kind, and
that no one, unless he is unworthy, will be deprived of the
inheritance of Heaven. "But if we are sons, we are also heirs:
heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ." [22]

<p>39. Such is the economy of duties and rights according to
Christian philosophy. Would it not seem that all conflict would
soon cease wherever this economy were to prevail in civil
society?

<p>40. Finally, the Church does not consider it enough to point out
the way of finding the cure, but she administers the remedy
herself. For she occupies herself fully in training and forming
men according to discipline and doctrine; and through the agency
of bishops and clergy, she causes the health-giving streams of
this doctrine to be diffused as widely as possible. Furthermore,
she strives to enter into men's minds and to bend their wills so
that they may suffer themselves to be ruled and governed by the
discipline of divine precepts. And in this field, which is of
first and greatest importance because in it the whole substance
and matter of benefits consists, the Church indeed has a power
that is especially unique. For the instruments which she uses to
move souls were given her for this very purpose by Jesus Christ,
and they have an efficacy implanted in them by God. Such
instruments alone can properly penetrate the inner recesses of
the heart and lead man to obedience to duty, to govern the
activities of his self-seeking mind, to love God and his
neighbors with a special and sovereign love, and to overcome
courageously all things that impede the path of virtue.

<p>41. In this connection it is sufficient briefly to recall to mind
examples from history. We shall mention events and facts that
admit of no doubt, namely, that human society in its civil
aspects was renewed fundamentally by Christian institutions;
that, by virtue of this renewal, mankind was raised to a higher
level, nay, was called back from death to life, and enriched with
such a degree of perfection as has never existed before and was
not destined to be greater in any succeeding age; and that,
finally, the same Jesus Christ is the beginning and end of these
benefits; for as all things have proceeded from Him, so they
must be referred back to Him. When, with the acceptance of the
light of the Gospel, the world had learned the great mystery of
the Incarnation of the Word and the redemption of man, the life
of Jesus Christ, God and man, spread through the nations and
imbued them wholly with His doctrine, with His precepts, and with
His laws. Wherefore, if human society is to be healed, only a
return to Christian life and institutions will heal it. In the
case of decaying societies it is most correctly prescribed that,
if they wish to be regenerated, they must be recalled to their
origins. For the perfection of all associations is this, namely,
to work for and to attain the purpose for which they were formed,
so that all social actions should be inspired by the same
principle which brought the society itself into being.
Wherefore, turning away from the original purpose is corruption,
while going back to this discovery is recovery. And just as we
affirm this as unquestionably true of the entire body of the
commonwealth, in like manner we affirm it of that order of
citizens who sustain life by labor and who constitute the vast
majority of society.

<p>42. But it must not be supposed that the Church so concentrates
her energies on caring for souls as to overlook things which
pertain to mortal and earthly life. As regards the non-owning
workers specifically, she desires and strives that they rise from
their most wretched state and enjoy better conditions. And to
achieve this result she makes no small contribution by the very
fact that she calls men to and trains them in virtue. For when
Christian morals are completely observed, they yield of
themselves a certain measure of prosperity to material existence,
because they win the favor of God, the source and fountain of all
goods; because they restrain the twin plagues of life --
excessive desire for wealth and thirst [23] for pleasure -- which
too often make man wretched amidst the very abundance of riches;
and because finally, Christian morals make men content with a
moderate livelihood and make them supplement income by thrift,
removing them far from the vices which swallow up both modest
sums and huge fortunes, and dissipate splendid inheritances.

<p>43. But, in addition, the Church provides directly for the well-being of the non-owning workers by instituting and promoting
activities which she knows to be suitable to relieve their
distress. Nay, even in the field of works of mercy, she has
always so excelled that she is highly praised by her very
enemies. The force of mutual charity among the first Christians
was such that the wealthier ones very often divested themselves
of their riches to aid others; wherefore, "Nor was there anyone
among them in want." [24] To the deacons, an order founded
expressly for this purpose, the Apostles assigned the duty of
dispensing alms daily; and the Apostle Paul, although burdened
with the care of all the churches, did not hesitate to spend
himself on toilsome journeys in order to bring alms personally to
the poorer Christians. Moneys of this kind, contributed
voluntarily by the Christians in every assembly, Tertullian calls
"piety's deposit fund," because they were expended to "support
and bury poor people, to supply the wants of orphan boys and
girls without means of support, of aged household servants, and
of such, too, as had suffered shipwreck." [25]

<p>44. Thence, gradually there came into existence that patrimony
which the Church has guarded with religious care as the property
of the poor. Nay, even disregarding the feeling of shame
associated with begging, she provided aid for the wretched poor.
For, as the common parent of rich and poor, with charity
everywhere stimulated to the highest degree, she founded
religious societies and numerous other useful bodies, so that,
with the aid which these furnished, there was scarcely any form
of human misery that went uncared for.

<p>45. And yet many today go so far as to condemn the Church as the
ancient pagans once did, for such outstanding charity, and would
substitute in lieu thereof a system of benevolence established by
the laws of the State. But no human devices can ever be found to
supplant Christian charity, which gives itself entirely for the
benefit of others. This virtue belongs to the Church alone, for,
unless it is derived from the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, it is
in no wise a virtue; and whosoever departs from the Church
wanders far from Christ.

<p>46. But there can be no question that, to attain Our purpose,
those helps also which are within the power of men are necessary.
Absolutely all who are concerned with the matter must, according
to their capacity, bend their efforts to this same end and work
for it. And this activity has a certain likeness to Divine
Providence governing the world; for generally we see effects
flow from the concert of all the elements upon which as causes
these effects depend.

<p>47. But it is now in order to inquire what portion of the remedy
should be expected from the State. By State here We understand
not the form of government which this or that people has, but
rather that form which right reason in accordance with nature
requires and the teachings of Divine wisdom approve, matters that
We have explained specifically in our Encyclical "On the
Christian Constitution of States."

<p>48. Therefore those governing the State ought primarily to devote
themselves to the service of individual groups and of the whole
commonwealth, and through the entire scheme of laws and
institutions to cause both public and individual well-being to
develop spontaneously out of the very structure and
administration of the State. For this is the duty of wise
statesmanship and the essential office of those in charge of the
State. Now, States are made prosperous especially by wholesome
morality, properly ordered family life, protection of religion
and justice, moderate imposition and equitable distribution of
public burdens, progressive development of industry and trade,
thriving agriculture, and by all other things of this nature,
which the more actively they are promoted, the better and happier
the life of the citizens is destined to be. Therefore, by virtue
of these things, it is within the competence of the rulers of the
State that, as they benefit other groups, they also improve in
particular the condition of the workers. Furthermore, they do
this with full right and without laying themselves open to any
charge of unwarranted interference. For the State is bound by
the very law of its office to serve the common interest. And the
richer the benefits which come from this general providence on
the part of the State, the less necessary it will be to
experiment with other measures for the well-being of workers.

<p>49. This ought to be considered, as it touches the question more
deeply, namely, that the State has one basic purpose for
existence, which embraces in common the highest and the lowest of
its members. Non-owning workers are unquestionably citizens by
nature in virtue of the same right as the rich, that is, true and
vital parts whence, through the medium of families, the body of
the State is constituted; and it hardly need be added that they
are by far the greatest number in every urban area. Since it
would be quite absurd to look out for one portion of the
citizens and to neglect another, it follows that public authority
ought to exercise due care in safeguarding the well-being and
the interests of non-owning workers. Unless this is done,
justice, which commands that everyone be given his own, will be
violated. Wherefore St. Thomas says wisely: "Even as part and
whole are in a certain way the same, so too that which pertains
to the whole pertains in a certain way to the part also." [26]
Consequently, among the numerous and weighty duties of rulers who
would serve their people well, this is first and foremost,
namely, that they protect equitably each and every class of
citizens, maintaining inviolate that justice especially which is
called <i>distributive</i>.

<p>50. Although all citizens, without exception, are obliged to
contribute something to the sum-total common goods, some share of
which naturally goes back to each individual, yet all can by no
means contribute the same amount and in equal degree. Whatever
the vicissitudes that occur in the forms of government, there
will always be those differences in the condition of citizens
without which society could neither exist nor be conceived. It
is altogether necessary that there be some who dedicate
themselves to the service of the State, who make laws, who
dispense justice, and finally, by whose counsel and authority
civil and military affairs are administered. These men, as is
clear, play the chief role in the Sate, and among every people
are to be regarded as occupying first place, because they work
for the common good most directly and preeminently. On the
other hand, those engaged in some calling benefit the State, but
not in the same way as the men just mentioned, nor by performing
the same duties; yet they, too, in a high degree, although less
directly, serve the common weal. Assuredly, since social good
must be of such a character that men through its acquisition are
made better, it must necessarily be founded on virtue.

<p>51. Nevertheless, an abundance of corporeal and external goods is
likewise a characteristic of a well-constituted State, "the use
of which goods is necessary for the practice of virtue." [27]
To produce these goods the labor of the workers, whether they
expend their skill and strength on farms or in factories, is most
efficacious and necessary. Nay, in this respect, their energy
and effectiveness are so important that it is incontestable that
the wealth of nations originates from no other source than from
the labor of workers. Equity therefore commands that public
authority show proper concern for the worker so that from what he
contributes to the common good he may receive what will enable
him, housed, clothed, and secure, to live his life without
hardship. Whence, it follows that all those measures ought to be
favored which seem in any way capable of benefiting the condition
of workers. Such solicitude is so far from injuring anyone, that
it is destined rather to benefit all, because it is of absolute
interest to the State that those citizens should not be miserable
in every respect from whom such necessary goods proceed.

<p>52. It is not right, as We have said, for either the citizen or
the family to be absorbed by the State; it is proper that the
individual and the family should be permitted to retain their
freedom of action, so far as this is possible without
jeopardizing the common good and without injuring anyone.
Nevertheless, those who govern must see to it that they protect
the community, because nature has entrusted its safeguarding to
the sovereign power in the State to such an extent that the
protection of the public welfare is not only the supreme law, but
is the entire cause and reason for sovereignty; and the
constituent parts, because philosophy and Christian faith agree
that the administration of the State has from nature as its
purpose, not the benefit of those to whom it has been entrusted,
but the benefit of those who have been entrusted to it. And
since the power of governing comes from God and is a
participation, as it were, in His supreme sovereignty, it ought
to be administered according to the example of the Divine power,
which looks with paternal care to the welfare of individual
creatures as well as to that of all creation. If, therefore, any
injury has been done to or threatens either the common good or
the interests of individual groups, which injury cannot in any
other way be repaired or prevented, it is necessary for public
authority to intervene.

<p>53. It is vitally important to public as well as to private
welfare that there be peace and good order; likewise, that the
whole regime of family life be directed according to the
ordinances of God and the principles of nature, that religion be
observed and cultivated, that sound morals flourish in private
and public life, that justice be kept sacred and that no one be
wronged with impunity by another, and that strong citizens grow
up, capable of supporting, and, if necessary, of protecting the
State. Wherefore, if at any time disorder should threaten
because of strikes or concerted stoppages of work, if the natural
bonds of family life should be relaxed among the poor, if
religion among the workers should be outraged by failure to
provide sufficient opportunity for performing religious duties,
if in factories danger should assail the integrity of morals
through the mixing of the sexes or other pernicious incitements
to sin, or if the employer class should oppress the working class
with unjust burdens or should degrade them with conditions
inimical to human personality or to human dignity, if health
should be injured by immoderate work and such as is not suited to
sex or age -- in all these cases, the power and authority of the
law, but of course within certain limits, manifestly ought to be
employed. And these limits are determined by the same reason
which demands the aid of the law, that is, the law ought not to
undertake more, nor it go farther, than the remedy of evils or
the removal of danger requires.

<p>54. Rights indeed, by whomsoever possessed, must be religiously
protected; and public authority, in warding off injuries and
punishing wrongs, ought to see to it that individuals may have
and hold what belongs to them. In protecting the rights of
private individuals, however, special consideration must be given
to the weak and the poor. For the nation, as it were, of the
rich, is guarded by its own defenses and is in less need of
governmental protection, whereas the suffering multitude, without
the means to protect itself, relies especially on the protection
of the State. Wherefore, since wage workers are numbered among
the great mass of the needy, the State must include them under
its special care and foresight.

<p>55. But it will be well to touch here expressly on certain
matters of special importance. The capital point is this, that
private property ought to be safeguarded by the sovereign power
of the State and through the bulwark of its laws. And
especially, in view of such a great flaming up of passion at the
present time, the masses ought to be kept within the bounds of
their moral obligations. For while justice does not oppose our
striving for better things, on the other hand, it does forbid
anyone to take from another what is his and, in the name of a
certain absurd equality, to seize forcibly the property of
others; nor does the interest of the common good itself permit
this. Certainly, the great majority of working people prefer to
secure better conditions by honest toil, without doing wrong to
anyone. Nevertheless, not a few individuals are found who,
imbued with evil ideas and eager for revolution, use every means
to stir up disorder and incite to violence. The authority of the
State, therefore, should intervene and, by putting restraint upon
such disturbers, protect the morals of workers from their
corrupting arts and lawful owners from the danger of spoliation.

<p>56. Labor which is too long and too hard and the belief that pay
is inadequate not infrequently give workers cause to strike and
become voluntarily idle. This evil, which is frequent and
serious, ought to be remedied by public authority, because such
interruption of work inflicts damage not only upon employers and
upon the workers themselves, but also injures trade and commerce
and the general interests of the State; and, since it is usually
not far removed from violence and rioting, it very frequently
jeopardizes public peace. In this matter it is more effective
and salutary that the authority of the law anticipate and
completely prevent the evil from breaking out by removing early
the causes from which it would seem that conflict between
employers and workers is bound to arise.

<p>57. And in like manner, in the case of the worker, there are many
things which the power of the State should protect; and, first
of all, the goods of his soul. For however good and desirable
mortal life be, yet it is not the ultimate goal for which we are
born, but a road only and a means for perfecting, through
knowledge of truth and love of good, the life of the soul. The
soul bears the express image and likeness of God, and there
resides in it that sovereignty through the medium of which man
has been bidden to rule all created nature below him and to make
all lands and all seas serve his interests. "Fill the earth and
subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of
the earth." [28] In this respect all men are equal, and there
is no difference between rich and poor, between masters and
servants, between rulers and subjects: "For there is the same
Lord of all." [29] No one may with impunity outrage the dignity
of man, which God Himself treats with great reverence, nor impede
his course to that level of perfection which accords with eternal
life in heaven. Nay, more, in this connection a man cannot even
by his own free choice allow himself to be treated in a way
inconsistent with his nature, and suffer his soul to be enslaved;
for there is no question here of rights belonging to man, but of
duties owed to God, which are to be religiously observed.

<p>58. Hence follows necessary cessation from toil and work on
Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. Let no one, however,
understand this in the sense of greater indulgence of idle
leisure, and much less in the sense of that kind of cessation
from work, such as many desire, which encourages vice and
promotes wasteful spending of money, but solely in the sense of a
repose from labor made sacred by religion. Rest combined with
religion calls man away from toil and the business of daily life
to admonish him to ponder on heavenly goods and to pay his just
and due homage to the Eternal Deity. This is especially the
nature, and this the cause, of the rest to be taken on Sundays
and Holy Days of Obligation, and God has sanctioned the same in
the Old Testament by a special law: "Remember thou keep holy the
Sabbath Day," [30] and He Himself taught it by His own action;
namely the mystical rest taken immediately after He had created
man: "He hath rested on the seventh day from all His work which
He had done." [31]

<p>59. Now as concerns the protection of corporeal and physical
goods, the oppressed workers, above all, ought to be liberated
from the savagery of greedy men, who inordinately use human
beings as things for gain. Assuredly, neither justice nor
humanity can countenance the exaction of so much work that the
spirit is dulled from excessive toil and that along with it the
body sinks crushed from exhaustion. The working energy of a man,
like his entire nature, is circumscribed by definite limits
beyond which it cannot go. It is developed indeed by exercise
and use, but only on condition that a man cease from work at
regular intervals and rest. With respect to daily work,
therefore, care ought to be taken not to extend it beyond the
hours that human strength warrants. The length of rest intervals
ought to be decided on the basis of the varying nature of the
work, of the circumstances of time and place, and of the physical
condition of the workers themselves. Since the labor of those
who quarry stone from the earth, or who mine iron, copper, or
other underground materials, is much more severe and harmful
to health, the working period for such men ought to be
correspondingly shortened. The seasons of the year also must be
taken into account; for often a given kind of work is easy to
endure in one season but cannot be endured at all in another, or
not without the greatest difficulty.

<p>60. Finally, it is not right to demand of a woman or a child what
a strong adult man is capable of doing or would be willing to do.
Nay, as regards children, special care ought to be taken that the
factory does not get hold of them before age has sufficiently
matured their physical, intellectual, and moral powers. For
budding strength in childhood, like greening verdure in spring,
is crushed by premature harsh treatment; and under such
circumstances all education of the child must needs be foregone.
Certain occupations, likewise, are less fitted for women, who are
intended by nature for work of the home -- work indeed which
especially protects modesty in women and accords by nature with
the education of children and the well-being of the family. Let
it be the rule everywhere that workers be given as much leisure
as will compensate for the energy consumed by toil, for rest from
work is necessary to restore strength consumed by use. In every
obligation which is mutually contracted between employers and
workers, this condition, either written or tacit, is always
present, that both kinds of rest be provided for; nor would it
be equitable to make an agreement otherwise, because no one has
the right to demand of, or to make an agreement with anyone to
neglect those duties which bind a man to God or to himself.

<p>61. We shall now touch upon a matter of very great importance,
and one which must be correctly understood in order to avoid
falling into error on one side or the other. We are told that
free consent fixes the amount of a wage; that therefore the
employer, after paying the wage agreed to would seem to have
discharged his obligation and not to owe anything more; that
only then would injustice be done if either the employer should
refuse to pay the whole amount of the wage, or the worker should
refuse to perform all the work to which he had committed himself;
and that in those cases, but in no others, is it proper for the
public authority to safeguard the rights of each party.

<p>62. An impartial judge would not assent readily or without
reservation to this reasoning, because it is not complete in all
respects; one factor to be considered, and one of the greatest
importance, is missing. To work is to expend one's energy for
the purpose of securing the things necessary for the various
needs of life and especially for its preservation. "In the sweat
of thy face shalt thou eat bread." [32] Accordingly, in man
sweat labor has two marks, as it were, implanted by nature, so
that it is truly <i>personal</i>, because work energy inheres in the
person and belongs completely to him by whom it is expended, and
for whose use it is destined by nature; and secondly, that it is
<i>necessary</i>, because man has need of the fruit of his labors to
preserve his life, and nature itself, which must be most strictly
obeyed, commands him to preserve it. If labor should be
considered only under the aspect that it is personal, there is no
doubt that it would be entirely in the worker's power to set the
amount of the agreed wage at too low a figure. For inasmuch as
he performs work by his own free will, he can also by his own
free will be satisfied with either a paltry wage for his work or
even with none at all. But this matter must be judged far
differently, if with the factor of <i>personality</i> we combine the
factor of <i>necessity</i>, from which indeed the former is separable
in thought but not in reality. In fact, to preserve one's life
is a duty common to all individuals, and to neglect this duty is
a crime. Hence arises necessarily the right of securing things
to sustain life, and only a wage earned by his labor gives a poor
man the means to acquire these things.

<p>63. Let it be granted then that worker and employer may enter
freely into agreements and, in particular, concerning the amount
of the wage; yet there is always underlying such agreements an
element of natural justice, and one greater and more ancient than
the free consent of contracting parties, namely, that the wage
shall not be less than enough to support a worker who is thrifty
and upright. If, compelled by necessity or moved by fear of a
worse evil, a worker accepts a harder condition, which although
against his will he must accept because an employer or contractor
imposes it, he certainly submits to force, against which justice
cries out in protest.

<p>64. But in these and similar questions, such as the number of
hours of work in each kind of occupation and the health
safeguards to be provided, particularly in factories, it will be
better, in order to avoid unwarranted governmental intervention,
especially since circumstances of business, season, and place are
so varied, that decision be reserved to the organizations of
which We are about to speak below, or else to pursue another
course whereby the interests of the workers may be adequately
safeguarded -- the State, if the occasion demands, to furnish
help and protection.

<p>65. If a worker receives a wage sufficiently large to enable him
to provide comfortably for himself, his wife and his children, he
will, if prudent, gladly strive to practice thrift; and the
result will be, as nature itself seems to counsel, that after
expenditures are deducted there will remain something over and
above through which he can come into the possession of a little
wealth. We have seen, in fact, that the whole question under
consideration cannot be settled effectually unless it is assumed
and established as a principle, that the right of private
property must be regarded as sacred. Wherefore, the law ought to
favor this right and, so far as it can, see that the largest
possible number among the masses of the population prefer to own
property.

<p>66. If this is done, excellent benefits will follow, foremost
among which will surely be a more equitable division of goods.
For the violence of public disorder has divided cities into two
classes of citizens, with an immense gulf lying between them. ON
the one side is a faction exceedingly powerful because
exceedingly rich. Since it alone has under its control every
kind of work and business, it diverts to its own advantage and
interest all production sources of wealth and exerts no little
power in the administration itself [sic] of the State. On the
other side are the needy and helpless masses, with minds inflamed
and always ready for disorder. But if the productive activity of
the multitude can be stimulated by the hope of acquiring some
property in land, it will gradually come to pass that, with the
difference between extreme wealth and extreme penury removed, one
class will become neighbor to the other. Moreover, there will
surely be a greater abundance of the things which the earth
produces. For when men know they are working on what belongs to
them, they work with far greater eagerness and diligence. Nay,
in a word, they learn to love the land cultivated by their own
hands, whence they look not only for food but for some measure of
abundance for themselves and their dependents. All can see how
much this willing eagerness contributes to an abundance of
produce and the wealth of a nation. Hence, in the third place,
will flow the benefit that men can easily be kept from leaving
the country in which they have been born and bred; for they
would not exchange their native country for a foreign land if
their native country furnished them sufficient means of living.

<p>67. But these advantages can be attained only if private wealth
is not drained away by crushing taxes of every kind. For since
the right of possessing goods privately has been conferred not by
man's law, but by nature, public authority cannot abolish it, but
can only control its exercise and bring it into conformity with
the commonweal. Public authority therefore would act unjustly
and inhumanly, if in the name of taxes it should appropriate from
the property of private individuals more than is equitable.

<p>68. Finally, employers and workers themselves can accomplish much
in this matter, manifestly through those institutions by the help
of which the poor are opportunely assisted and the two classes of
society are brought closer to each other. Under this category
come associations for giving mutual aid; various agencies
established by the foresight of private persons to care for the
worker and likewise for his dependent wife and children in the
event that an accident, sickness, or death befalls him; and
foundations to care for boys and girls, for adolescents, and for
the aged.

<p>69. But associations of workers occupy first place, and they
include within their circle clearly all the rest. The beneficent
achievements of the guilds of artisans among our ancestors have
long been well known. Truly, they yielded noteworthy advantages
not only to artisans, but, as many monuments bear witness,
brought glory and progress to the arts themselves. In our
present age of greater culture, with its new customs and ways of
living, and with the increased number of things required by daily
life, it is most clearly necessary that workers' associations be
adapted to meet the present need. It is gratifying that
societies of this kind composed either of workers alone or of
workers and employers together are being formed everywhere, and
it is truly to be desired that they grow in number and in active
vigor. Although We have spoken of them more than once, it seems
well to show in this place that they are highly opportune and are
formed by their own right, and, likewise to show how they should
be organized and what they should do.

<p>70. Inadequacy of his own strength, learned from experience,
impels and urges a man to enlist the help of others. Such is the
teaching of Holy Scripture: "It is better therefore that two
should be together than one; for they have the advantage of
their society. If one fall he shall be supported by the other;
woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth he hath none to
lift him up." [33] And this also: "A brother that is helped by
his brother, is like a strong city." [34] Just as man is drawn
by this natural propensity into civil union and association, so
he also seeks with his fellow citizens to form other societies,
admittedly small and not perfect, but societies none the less.

<p>71. Between these latter and the large society of the State,
there is, because of their different immediate purposes, a very
great distinction. The end of civil society concerns absolutely
all members of this society, since the end of civil society is
centered in the common good, in which latter, one and all in due
proportion have a right to participate. Wherefore, this society
is called <i>public</i>, because through it "all men share with one
another in establishing a commonwealth." [35] On the other
hand, societies which are formed, so to speak, within its bosom
are considered <i>private</i> and are such because their immediate
object is private advantage, appertaining to those alone who are
thus associated together. "Now a private society is one which is
formed to carry out some business, as when two or three enter
into association for the purpose of engaging together in trade."
[36]

<p>72. Although private societies exist within the State and are, as
it were, so many parts of it, still it is not within the
authority of the State universally and <i>per se</i> to forbid them to
exist as such. For man is permitted by a right of nature to form
private societies; the State, on the other hand, has been
instituted to protect and not to destroy natural right, and if it
should forbid its citizens to enter into associations, it would
clearly do something contradictory to itself because both the
State itself and private associations are begotten of one and the
same principle, namely, that men are by nature inclined to
associate. Occasionally, there are times when it is proper for
the laws to oppose associations of this kind, that is, if they
professedly seek after any objective which is clearly at variance
with good morals, with justice, or with the welfare of the State.
Indeed, in these cases the public power shall justly prevent such
associations from forming and shall also justly dissolve those
already formed. Nevertheless, it must use the greatest
precaution lest it appear to infringe on the rights of its
citizens, and lest, under the pretext of public benefit it enact
any measure that sound reason would not support. For laws are to
be obeyed only insofar as they conform with right reason and thus
with the eternal law of God. [37]

<p>73. Here come to Our mind for consideration the various
confraternities, societies, and religious orders which the
authority of the Church and the piety of Christians have brought
into being; and history down to our own times speaks of the
wonderful benefit they have been to the human race. Since
societies of this character, even if judged in the light of
reason alone, have been formed for an honest purpose, it is clear
that they have been formed in accordance with natural right. But
in whatever respect they concern religion, they are properly
subject to the Church alone. Therefore those in charge of the
State cannot in justice abrogate to themselves any right over
them or assume their administration to themselves. Rather it is
the office of the State to respect, to conserve, and as occasion
may require, to protect them from injustice. Yet we have seen
something entirely different being done, especially at the
present time. In many places the State has violated associations
of this kind, and in fact with manifold injury, since it has put
them in the bonds of the civil law, has divested them of their
lawful right to be considered legal persons, and has robbed them
of their property. In this property the Church possessed her
rights, and individual association members possessed theirs, as
did also the persons who donated this property for a designated
purpose as well as those for whose benefit and relief it had been
donated. Consequently, We cannot refrain from deploring such
vicious and unjust acts of robbery, and so much the more because
We see the road being closed to Catholic associations, which are
law-abiding and in every respect useful, at the very time when it
is being decreed that most assuredly men are permitted by law to
form associations, and at the very time when this freedom is
being lavishly granted in actual fact to men urging courses of
conduct pernicious at once to religion and to the State.

<p>74. Certainly, the number of associations of almost every
possible kind, especially of associations of workers, is now far
greater than ever before. This is not the place to inquire
whence many of them originate, what object they have, or how they
proceed. But the opinion is, and it is one confirmed by a good
deal of evidence, that they are largely under the control of
secret leaders and that these leaders apply principles which are
in harmony neither with Christianity nor with the welfare of
States, and that, after having possession of all available work,
they contrive that those who refuse to join with them will be
forced by want to pay the penalty. Under these circumstances,
workers who are Christians must choose one of two things; either
to join associations in which it is greatly to be feared that
there is danger to religion, or to form their own associations
and unite their forces in such a way that they may be able
manfully to free themselves from such unjust and intolerable
opposition. Can they who refuse to place man's highest good in
imminent jeopardy hesitate to affirm that the second course is by
all means to be followed?

<p>75. Many of our Faith are indeed to be highly commended, who,
having rightly perceived what the times require of them, are
experimenting and striving to discover how by honest means they
can raise the non-owning working class to higher living levels.
They have championed their cause and are endeavoring to increase
the prosperity of both families and individuals, and at the same
time to regulate justly the mutual obligations which rest upon
workers and employers and to foster and strengthen in both
consciousness of duty and observance of the precepts of the
Gospel -- precepts, in truth, which hold man back from excess and
prevent him from overstepping the bounds of moderation and, in
the midst of the widest divergences among persons and things,
maintain harmony in the State. For this reason, we see eminent
men meeting together frequently to exchange ideas, to combine
their forces, and to deliberate on the most expedient programs of
action. Others are endeavoring to unite the various kinds of
workers in suitable associations, are assisting them with advice
and money, and making plans to prevent a lack of honest and
profitable work. The bishops are giving encouragement and
bestowing support; and under their authority and auspices many
from the ranks of the clergy, both regular and diocesan, are
showing zealous care for all that pertains to the spiritual
improvement of the members of these associations. Finally, there
are not wanting Catholics of great wealth, yet voluntary sharers,
as it were, in the lot of the wage workers, who by their own
generous contributions are striving to found and extend
associations through which the worker is readily enabled to
obtain from his toil not only immediate benefits, but also
assurance of honorable retirement in the future. How much good
such manifold and enthusiastic activity has contributed to the
benefit of all this is too well known to make discussion
necessary. From all this, We have taken auguries of good hope
for the future, provided that societies of this kind continually
grow and that they are founded with wise organization. Let the
State protect these lawfully associated bodies of citizens; let
it not, however, interfere with their private concerns and order
of life; for vital activity is set in motion by an inner
principle, and it is very easily destroyed, as We know, by
intrusion from without.

<p>76. Unquestionably, wise direction and organization are essential
to these associations in order that in their activities there be
unity of purpose and concord of wills. Furthermore, if citizens
have the free right to associate, as in fact they do, they must
also have the right freely to adopt the organization and rules
which they judge most appropriate to achieve their purpose. We
do not feel that the precise character in all details which the
aforementioned direction and organization of associations ought
to have can be determined by fast and fixed rules, since this is
a matter to be decided rather in the light of the temperament of
each people, of experiment and practice, of the nature and
character of the work, of the extent of trade and commerce, and
of other circumstances of a material and temporal kind, all of
which must be carefully considered. In summary, let this be laid
down as a general and constant law: Workers' associations ought
to be so constituted and so governed as to furnish the most
suitable and most convenient means to attain the object proposed,
which consists in this, that the individual members of the
association secure, so far as possible, an increase in the goods
of body, of soul, and of prosperity.

<p>77. It is clear, however, that moral and religious perfection
ought to be regarded as their principal goal, and that their
social organization as such ought above all to be directed
completely by this goal. For otherwise, they would degenerate in
nature and would be little better than those associations in
which no account is ordinarily taken of religion. Besides, what
would it profit a worker to secure through an association an
abundance of goods, if his soul through lack of its proper food
should run the risk of perishing? "What doth it profit a man, if
he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss of his own soul?"
[38] Christ Our Lord teaches that this in fact must be
considered the mark whereby a Christian is distinguished from a
pagan: "After all these things the Gentiles seek -- seek ye
first the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things
shall be given you besides." [39] Therefore, having taken their
principles from God, let those associations provide ample
opportunity for religious instruction so that individual members
may understand their duties to God, that they may well know what
to believe, what to hope for, and what to do for eternal
salvation, and that with special care they may be fortified
against erroneous opinions and various forms of corruption. Let
the worker be exhorted to the worship of God and the pursuit of
piety, especially to religious observance of Sundays and Holy
Days. Let him learn to reverence and love the Church, the common
Mother of all, and likewise to observe her precepts and to
frequent her Sacraments, which are the divine means for purifying
the soul from the status of sin and for attaining sanctity.

<p>78. When the regulation of associations are founded upon
religion, the way is easy toward establishing the mutual
relations of the members so that peaceful living together and
prosperity will result. Offices in the associations are to be
distributed properly in accordance with the common interest, and
in such a way, moreover, that wide difference in these offices
may not create discord. It is of special importance that
obligations be apportioned wisely and be clearly defined, to the
end that no one is done an injustice. Let the funds be disbursed
equitably in such a way that the amount of benefit to be paid out
to members is fixed beforehand in accordance with individual
needs, and let the rights and duties of employers be properly
adjusted to the rights and duties of workers. If any one in
these two groups feels that he has been injured in any way,
nothing is more to be desired than that prudent and upright men
of the same body be available, and that the association
regulations themselves prescribe that the dispute be settled
according to the decision of these men.

<p>79. It must also be specially provided that the worker at no time
be without sufficient work, and that the moneys paid into the
treasury of the association furnish the means of assisting
individual members in need, not only during sudden and unforeseen
changes in industry, but also whenever anyone is stricken by
sickness, by old age, or by misfortune.

<p>80. Through these regulations, provided they are readily
accepted, the interests and welfare of the poor will be
adequately cared for. Associations of Catholics, moreover, will
undoubtedly be of great importance in promoting prosperity in the
State. Through past events we can, without temerity, foresee the
future. Age presses hard upon age, but there are wondrous
similarities in history, governed as it is by the Providence of
God. Who guides and directs the continuity and the chain of
events in accordance with that purpose which He set before
Himself in creating the human race. In the early ages, when the
Church was in her youth, We know that the reproach was hurled at
the Christians that the great majority of them lived by
precarious alms or by toil. Yet, although destitute of wealth
and power, they succeeded in winning the good will of the rich
and the protection of the mighty. All could see that they were
energetic, industrious, peace-loving, and exemplarily devoted to
the practice of justice and especially of charity. In the
presence of life and conduct such as this, all prejudice
vanished, the taunting voices of the malevolent were silenced,
and the falsehoods of inveterate superstition yielded little by
little to Christian truth.

<p>81. The condition of workers is a subject of bitter controversy
at the present time; and whether this controversy is resolved in
accordance with reason or otherwise, it is in either event of
utmost importance to the State. But Christian workers will
readily resolve it in accordance with reason if, united in
associations and under wise leaders, they enter upon the path
which their fathers and their ancestors followed to their own
best welfare as well as to that of the State. For, no matter how
strong the power of prejudice and passion in man, yet, unless
perversity of will has deadened the sense of the right and just,
the good will of citizens is certain to be more freely inclined
toward those whom they learn to know as industrious and
temperate, and who clearly place justice before profit and
conscientious observance of duty before all else. Under those
circumstances there will follow also this great advantage, that
no little hope and opportunity for developing a sound attitude
will be afforded those workers who live in complete disdain of
the Christian Faith or in a manner foreign to its profession.
These men, indeed, for the most part, know that they have been
deceived by illusory hopes and by false appearances. They are
conscious of being most inhumanly treated by greedy employers,
that almost no greater value is placed on them than the amount of
gain they yield by their toil, and that in the associations,
moreover, in whose meshes they are caught, there exist in place
of charity and love, internal dissensions which are the
inseparable companions of aggravating and irreligious poverty.
Broken in spirit, and worn out in body, how gladly many would
free themselves from a servitude so degrading! Yet they dare not
because either human shame or the fear of want prevents them. It
is remarkable how much associations of Catholics can contribute
to the welfare of all such men if they invite those wavering in
uncertainty to their bosom in order to remedy their difficulties,
and if they receive the penitents into their trust and
protection.

<p>82. These, Venerable Brethren, are the persons, and this is the
procedure to be employed in dealing with this most difficult
question. Everyone according to his position ought to gird
himself for the task, and indeed as speedily as possible, lest,
by delaying the remedy, the evil, which is already of vast
dimensions, become incurable. Let those in charge of States make
use of the provision afforded by laws and institutions; let the
rich and employers be mindful of their duties; let the workers,
whose cause is at stake, press their claims with reason. And
since religion alone, as We said in the beginning, can remove the
evil, root and branch, let all reflect upon this: First and
foremost Christian morals must be reestablished, without which
even the weapons of prudence, which are considered especially
effective, will be of no avail, to secure well-being.

<p>83. So far as the Church is concerned, at no time and in no
manner will she permit her efforts to be wanting, and she will
contribute all the more help in proportion as she has more
freedom of action. Let this be understood in particular by those
whose duty it is to promote the public welfare. Let the members
of the Sacred Ministry exert all their strength of mind and all
their diligence, and Venerable Brethren, under the guidance of
your authority and example, let them not cease to impress upon
men of all ranks the principles of Christian living as found in
the Gospel; by all means in their power let them strive for the
well-being of people; and especially let them aim both to
preserve in themselves and to arouse in others, in the highest
equally as well as in the lowest, the mistress and queen of the
virtues, Charity. Certainly, the well-being which is so longed
for is chiefly to be expected from an abundant outpouring of
charity; of Christian charity, we mean, which is in epitome the
law of the Gospel, and which, always ready to sacrifice itself
for the benefit of others, is man's surest antidote against the
insolence of the world and immoderate love of self; the divine
office and features of this virtue being described by the Apostle
Paul in these words: "Charity is patient, is kind . . . is not self-seeking . . . bears with all things . . . endures all things." [40]

<p>84. As a pledge of Divine favor and as a token of Our affection,
most lovingly in the Lord We bestow on each of you, Venerable
Brethren, on your clergy and on your people, the Apostolic
Blessing.
