<h1>Rosarium Virginis Mari&aelig;</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Letter <i>Rosarium Virginis Mari&aelig;</i> of the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II to the Bishops, Clergy and Faithful on the the Most Holy Rosary</b>

<p><i>See also:</i> Our "How to Recite the Rosary" sheet in <a href="../images/rosary.pdf">PDF format</a>, and the <a href="../faq/scriptlum.htm">Luminous Mysteries for the Scriptural Rosary</a>.

<p align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, which gradually took form in the second
millennium under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> loved by
countless <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a> and encouraged by the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Magisterium</a>. Simple yet profound, it
still remains, at the dawn of this third millennium, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of great
significance, destined to bring forth a harvest of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. It blends easily
into the spiritual journey of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, which, after two thousand
years, has lost none of the freshness of its beginnings and feels drawn by the
<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> to "set out into the deep" (<i>duc in altum!</i>) in order
once more to proclaim, and even cry out, before the world that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is
Lord and Saviour, "the way, and the truth and the life" (<i>Jn </i>14:6),
"the goal of human history and the point on which the desires of history and
civilization turn".<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric
<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the <i>depth of the Gospel
message in its entirety</i>, of which it can be said to be a compendium.<sup>2 </sup>It is an echo of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, her perennial <a href="../cathen/09534a.htm"><i>Magnificat</i></a> for the work of the redemptive
<a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> which began in her virginal womb. With the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, the Christian
people <i>sits at the school of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a></i> and is led to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> the beauty on
the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and to experience the depths of his love. Through the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> receive abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as though from the very hands of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of the Redeemer</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>The Popes and the Rosary</b></i></p>
<p>2. Numerous predecessors of mine attributed great importance to this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.
Worthy of special note in this regard is <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> who on 1 September 1883
promulgated the Encyclical
<a href="../library/index.html#docs/le13so.htm"><i>Supremi Apostolatus Officio</i></a>,<sup>3 </sup>a document of great worth, the first of his many statements about this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,
in which he proposed the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> as an effective spiritual weapon against the
evils afflicting society. Among the more recent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Popes</a> who, from the time of the
Second Vatican Council, have distinguished themselves in promoting the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> I
would mention Blessed John XXIII<sup>4 </sup>and above all Pope Paul VI, who in his Apostolic Exhortation <i>Marialis Cultus</i>
emphasized, in the spirit of the Second Vatican Council, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary's</a>
evangelical character and its Christocentric inspiration. I myself have often encouraged the frequent recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. From my
youthful years this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has held an important place in my spiritual life. I
was powerfully reminded of this during my recent visit to Poland, and in
particular at the Shrine of Kalwaria. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> has accompanied me in moments
of joy and in moments of difficulty. To it I have entrusted any number of
concerns; in it I have always found comfort. Twenty-four years ago, on 29
October 1978, scarcely two weeks after my <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">election</a> to the See of Peter, I
frankly admitted: "The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is my favourite <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. A marvellous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>!
Marvellous in its simplicity and its depth. [...]. It can be said that the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is, in some sense, a prayer-commentary on the final chapter of the
Vatican II Constitution <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, a chapter which discusses the
wondrous presence of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> in the mystery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
Against the background of the words<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Ave Maria</a> </i>the principal events of the
<a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Jesus Christ</a> pass before the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. They take shape in the
complete series of the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries, and they put us
in living communion with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> through – we might say – the <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart of his Mother</a>.
At the same time our heart can embrace in the decades of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> all the
events that make up the lives of individuals, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, nations, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and
all mankind. Our personal concerns and those of our neighbour, especially those
who are closest to us, who are dearest to us. Thus the simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> marks the rhythm of human life".<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>With these words, dear brothers and sisters, I set <i>the first year of my
Pontificate</i> within the daily rhythm of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. Today, <i>as I begin the
twenty-fifth year of my service as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Successor of Peter</a></i>, I wish to do the
same. How many graces have I received in these years from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>
through the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>: <i>Magnificat anima mea Dominum! </i>I wish to lift up my
thanks to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> in the words of his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Most Holy Mother</a>, under whose protection
I have placed my Petrine ministry: <i>Totus Tuus</i>!</p>
<p><i><b>October 2002 – October 2003: The Year of the Rosary</b></i></p>
<p>3. Therefore, in continuity with my reflection in the Apostolic Letter <i>Novo
Millennio Ineunte</i>, in which, after the experience of the Jubilee, I invited
the people of God to "start afresh from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>",<sup>6 </sup>I have felt drawn to offer a reflection on the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, as a kind of Marian
complement to that Letter and an exhortation to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
in union with, and at the school of, his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Most Holy Mother</a>. To recite the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
is nothing other than to <i><a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a></i>. As a
way of highlighting this invitation, prompted by the forthcoming 120th
anniversary of the aforementioned <a href="../library/index.html#docs/le13so.htm">Encyclical of Leo XIII</a>, I desire that during the course of this year the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> should be
especially emphasized and promoted in the various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities. I
therefore proclaim the year from October 2002 to October 2003 <i>the Year of the
Rosary</i>.</p>
<p>I leave this pastoral proposal to the initiative of each ecclesial community. It
is not my intention to encumber but rather to complete and consolidate pastoral
programmes of the Particular Churches. I am confident that the proposal will
find a ready and generous reception. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, reclaimed in its full meaning,
goes to the very heart of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life; it offers a familiar yet fruitful
spiritual and educational opportunity for personal <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, the formation
of the People of God, and the new evangelization. I am pleased to reaffirm this
also in the joyful remembrance of another anniversary: the fortieth anniversary
of the opening of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council on October 11, 1962, the
"great grace" disposed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in our time.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p><i><b>Objections to the Rosary</b></i></p>
<p>4. The timeliness of this proposal is evident from a number of considerations.
First, the urgent need to counter a certain crisis of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, which in the present
historical and theological context can risk being wrongly devalued, and
therefore no longer taught to the younger generation. There are some who think
that the centrality of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, rightly stressed by the Second Vatican
Ecumenical Council, necessarily entails giving lesser importance to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>.
Yet, as Pope Paul VI made clear, not only does this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> not conflict with the
<a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, <i>it sustains it</i>, since it serves as an excellent introduction and
a faithful echo of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, enabling people to participate fully and
interiorly in it and to reap its fruits in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps too, there are some who fear that the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is somehow unecumenical
because of its distinctly Marian character. Yet the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> clearly belongs to
the kind of veneration of the Mother of God described by the Council: a <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a>
directed to the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> centre of the Christian faith, in such a way that
"when the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother</a> is honoured, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son</a> ... is duly known, loved and
glorified".<sup>8 </sup>If properly revitalized, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is an aid and certainly not a hindrance to
ecumenism!</p>
<p><i><b>A path of contemplation</b></i></p>
<p>5. But the most important reason for strongly encouraging the practice of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is that it represents a most effective means of fostering among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that <i>commitment
to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mystery </i>which I have proposed in the
Apostolic Letter <i>Novo Millennio Ineunte</i> as a genuine "training in
<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>": "What is needed is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life distinguished above all in
the <i>art of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></i>".<sup>9 </sup>Inasmuch as contemporary culture, even amid so many indications to the
contrary, has witnessed the flowering of a new call for spirituality, due also
to the influence of other religions, it is more urgent than ever that our
<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities should become "genuine schools of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>".<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> belongs among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Christian contemplation</a>. Developed in the West, it is a typically meditative
<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, corresponding in some way to the "prayer of the heart" or "Jesus
prayer" which took root in the soil of the Christian East.</p>
<p><i><b>Prayer for peace and for the family</b></i></p>
<p>6. A number of historical circumstances also make a revival of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> quite
timely. First of all, the need to implore from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <i>the gift of peace</i>. The
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> has many times been proposed by my predecessors and myself as a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>
for peace. At the start of a millennium which began with the terrifying attacks
of 11 September 2001, a millennium which witnesses every day innumerous parts of the world fresh scenes of bloodshed and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, to
rediscover the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> means to immerse oneself in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the mystery
of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> who "is our peace", since he made "the two of us one, and broke
down the dividing wall of hostility" (<i>Eph </i>2:14). Consequently, one
cannot recite the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> without feeling caught up in a clear commitment to
advancing peace, especially in the land of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, still so sorely afflicted and
so close to the heart of every Christian.</p>
<p>A similar need for commitment and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> arises in relation to another critical
contemporary issue: <i>the family</i>, the primary cell of society, increasingly
menaced by forces of disintegration on both the ideological and practical
planes, so as to make us fear for the future of this fundamental and
indispensable institution and, with it, for the future of society as a whole.
The revival of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a>, within the context of a broader
pastoral ministry to the family, will be an effective aid to countering the
devastating effects of this crisis typical of our age.</p>
<p><b>"<i>Behold, your Mother!" </i>(<i>Jn </i>19:27)</b></p>
<p>7. Many signs indicate that still today the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> desires to exercise
through this same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that maternal concern to which the dying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>
entrusted, in the person of the beloved disciple, all the sons and daughters of
the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "Woman, behold your son!" (<i>Jn</i>19:26). Well-known are the
occasions in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries on which the Mother of
Christ made her presence felt and her voice heard, in order to exhort the People
of God to this form of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative prayer</a>. I would mention in particular, on
account of their great influence on the lives of Christians and the
authoritative recognition they have received from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparitions</a> of
<a href="../cathen/09389b.htm">Lourdes</a> and of Fatima;<sup>11 </sup>these shrines continue to be visited by great numbers of pilgrims seeking
comfort and hope.</p>
<p><i><b>Following the witnesses</b></i></p>
<p>8. It would be impossible to name all the many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a> who discovered in the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> a genuine path to growth in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. We need but mention <a href="../cathen/09384a.htm">Saint Louis
Marie Grignion de Montfort</a>, the author of an excellent work on the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>,<sup>12</sup>
and, closer to ourselves, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, whom I recently had the joy
of canonizing. As a true apostle of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, Blessed Bartolo Longo had a
special charism. His path to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> rested on an inspiration heard in the
depths of his heart: "Whoever spreads the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is saved!".<sup>13 </sup>As a result, he felt called to build a Church dedicated to Our Lady of the Holy
Rosary in Pompei, against the background of the ruins of the ancient city, which
scarcely heard the proclamation of Christ before being buried in 79 A.D. during
an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, only to emerge centuries later from its ashes as
a witness to the lights and shadows of classical civilization. By his whole
life's work and especially by the practice of the "Fifteen Saturdays",
Bartolo Longo promoted the Christocentric and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a> heart of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>,
and received great encouragement and support from <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, the "Pope of the
Rosary".</p>

<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>CONTEMPLATING CHRIST WITH MARY</b></p>
<p><i><b>A face radiant as the sun</b></i></p>
<p>9. "And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun" (<i>Mt</i>
17:2). The Gospel scene of <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Christ's transfiguration</a>, in which the three <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>
<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> appear entranced by the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>, can be
seen as <i>an icon of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Christian contemplation</a>.</i> To look upon the face of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to recognize its mystery amid the daily events and the sufferings of his
human life, and then to grasp the divine splendour definitively revealed in the
Risen Lord, seated in glory at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: this is the task of
every follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and therefore the task of each one of us. In
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplating</a> Christ's face we become open to receiving the mystery of
Trinitarian life, experiencing ever anew the love of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and delighting
in the joy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saint Paul's</a> words can then be applied to us:
"Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being changed into his likeness, from
one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the
<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>" (<i>2Cor</i> 3:18).</p>
<p><i><b>Mary, model of contemplation</b></i></p>
<p>10. The <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has an <i>incomparable model </i>in <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. In a
unique way the face of the Son belongs to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. It was in her womb that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
was formed, receiving from her a human resemblance which points to an even
greater spiritual closeness. No one has ever devoted himself to the
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as faithfully as <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. The eyes of her <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart</a>
already turned to him at the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, when she conceived him by the power
of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. In the months that followed she began to sense his presence
and to picture his features. When at last she gave birth to him in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,
her eyes were able to gaze tenderly on the face of her Son, as she "wrapped
him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger" (<i>Lk</i>2:7).</p>
<p>Thereafter <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> gaze, ever filled with adoration and wonder, would never leave
him. At times it would be <i>a questioning look</i>, as in the episode of the
finding in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>: "Son, why have you treated us so?" (<i>Lk</i> 2:48);
it would always be <i>a penetrating gaze</i>, one capable of deeply
understanding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, even to the point of perceiving his hidden feelings and
anticipating his decisions, as at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> (cf. <i>Jn </i>2:5). At other times it
would be <i>a look of sorrow</i>, especially beneath the Cross, where her vision
would still be that of a mother giving birth, for <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> not only shared the
passion and death of her Son, she also received the new son given to her in the
beloved disciple (cf. <i>Jn </i>19:26-27). On the morning of Easter hers would
be <i>a gaze radiant with the joy of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a></i>, and finally, on the
day of <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>, <i>a gaze afire</i> with the outpouring of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> (cf. <i>Acts
</i>1:14).</p>
<p><i><b>Mary's memories</b></i></p>
<p>11. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> lived with her eyes fixed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, treasuring his every word: "She
kept all these things, pondering them in her <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart</a>" (<i>Lk</i> 2:19; cf.
2:51). The memories of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, impressed upon her <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart</a>, were always with her,
leading her to reflect on the various moments of her life at her Son's side. In
a way those memories were to be the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">"rosary"</a> which she recited
uninterruptedly throughout her earthly life.</p>
<p>Even now, amid the joyful songs of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly Jerusalem</a>, the reasons for her
thanksgiving and praise remain unchanged. They inspire her maternal concern for
the pilgrim <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which she continues to relate her personal account of the
Gospel. <i><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> constantly sets before the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> the "mysteries" of her
Son</i>, with the desire that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of those mysteries will release
all their saving power. In the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, the Christian community
enters into contact with the memories and the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a> gaze of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Rosary, a contemplative prayer</b></i></p>
<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, precisely because it starts with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> own experience, is <i>an
exquisitely <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a> prayer</i>. Without this <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a> dimension, it
would lose its meaning, as Pope Paul VI clearly pointed out: "Without
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is a body without a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and its recitation runs the
risk of becoming a mechanical repetition of formulas, in violation of the
admonition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: 'In praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles
do; for they think they will be heard for their many words' (<i>Mt</i> 6:7). By
its nature the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering
pace, helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Lord's life</a> as
seen through the eyes of her who was closest to the Lord. In this way the
unfathomable riches of these mysteries are disclosed".<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>It is worth pausing to consider this profound insight of Paul VI, in order to
bring out certain aspects of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> which show that it is really a form of
Christocentric <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Remembering Christ with Mary</b></i></p>
<p>13. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is above all <i>a remembering</i>. We need to
understand this word in the biblical sense of remembrance (<i>zakar</i>) as a
making present of the works brought about by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the history of salvation.
The <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a> is an account of saving events culminating in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself. These
events not only belong to "yesterday"; <i>they are also part of the
"today" of salvation</i>. This making present comes about above all in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>: what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accomplished
centuries ago did not only affect the direct witnesses of those events; it
continues to affect people in every age with its gift of grace. To some extent
this is also true of every other devout approach to those events: to
"remember" them in a spirit of faith and love is to be open to the grace
which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> won for us by the mysteries of his <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, death and
<a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>.</p>
<p>Consequently, while it must be reaffirmed with the Second Vatican Council that
the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, as the exercise of the priestly office of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and an act of
public worship, is "the summit to which the activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is directed
and the font from which all its power flows",<sup>15 </sup>it is also necessary to recall that the spiritual life "is not limited solely
to participation in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>. Christians, while they are called to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in
common, must also go to their own rooms to pray to their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> in secret (cf. <i>Mt</i>
6:6); indeed, according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, they must pray without
ceasing (cf.<i>1 Thes </i>5:17)".<sup>16 </sup>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, in its own particular way, is part of this varied panorama of "ceaseless" <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. If the
<a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, as the activity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is <i>a saving action par
excellence</i>, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> too, as a "meditation" with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is <i>a
salutary <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a></i>. By immersing us in the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Redeemer's life</a>,
it ensures that what he has done and what the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> makes present is
profoundly assimilated and shapes our existence.</p>
<p><i><b>Learning Christ from Mary</b></i></p>
<p>14. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the supreme Teacher, the revealer and the one revealed. It is not
just a question of learning what he taught but of "<i>learning him</i>". In
this regard could we have any better teacher than <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>? From the divine
standpoint, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is the interior teacher who leads us to the full truth of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (cf. <i>Jn </i>14:26; 15:26; 16:13). But among creatures no one knows
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> better than <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; no one can introduce us to a profound knowledge of his
mystery better than his Mother.</p>
<p>The first of the "signs" worked by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> – the changing of water into wine
at the marriage in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> – clearly presents <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> in the guise of a teacher, as
she urges the servants to do what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> commands (cf. <i>Jn </i>2:5). We can
imagine that she would have done likewise for the disciples after <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Jesus'
Ascension</a>, when she joined them in awaiting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and supported them
in their first mission. <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Contemplating</a> the scenes of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> in union with
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is a means of learning from her to "read" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to discover his
secrets and to understand his message.</p>
<p>This school of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is all the more effective if we consider that she teaches by
obtaining for us in abundance the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even as she offers
us the incomparable example of her own "pilgrimage of faith".<sup>17 </sup>As we <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> each mystery of <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">her Son's life</a>, she invites us to do as she
did at the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>: to ask humbly the questions which open us to the light,
in order to end with the obedience of faith: "Behold I am the handmaid of the
Lord; be it done to me according to your word" (<i>Lk</i> 1:38).</p>
<p><i><b>Being conformed to Christ with Mary</b></i></p>
<p>15. Christian spirituality is distinguished by the disciple's commitment to
become conformed ever more fully to his Master (cf. <i>Rom </i>8:29; <i>Phil</i>
3:10,12). The outpouring of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> grafts the believer like
a branch onto the vine which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (cf. <i>Jn </i>15:5) and makes him a
member of Christ's mystical Body (cf.<i>1Cor </i>12:12; <i>Rom </i>12:5). This
initial unity, however, calls for a growing assimilation which will increasingly
shape the conduct of the disciple in accordance with the "mind" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>:
"Have this mind among yourselves, which was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>" (<i>Phil </i>2:5).
In the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, we are called "to put on the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>"
(cf. <i>Rom </i>13:14; <i>Gal </i>3:27).</p>
<p>In the spiritual journey of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, based on the constant <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> –
in <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> company – of the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this demanding ideal of being
conformed to him is pursued through an association which could be described in
terms of friendship. We are thereby enabled to enter naturally into <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Christ's
life</a> and as it were to share his deepest feelings. In this regard Blessed
Bartolo Longo has written: "Just as two friends, frequently in each other's
company, tend to develop similar habits, so too, by holding familiar converse
with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, by meditating on the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
and by living the same life in <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, we can become, to the extent of
our lowliness, similar to them and can learn from these supreme models a life of
humility, poverty, hiddenness, patience and perfection".<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>In this process of being conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, we entrust ourselves
in a special way to the maternal care of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. She who is both the
Mother of Christ and a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, indeed her "pre-eminent and
altogether singular member",<sup>19 </sup>is at the same time the "Mother of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". As such, she continually
brings to birth children for the mystical Body of her Son. She does so through
her <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>, imploring upon them the inexhaustible outpouring of the
<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is <i>the perfect icon of the motherhood of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> mystically transports us to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> side as she is busy watching over
the human growth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the home of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. This enables her to train us
and to mold us with the same care, until <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is "fully formed" in us (cf.
<i>Gal
</i>4:19). This role of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, totally grounded in that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and radically
subordinated to it, "in no way obscures or diminishes the unique mediation of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but rather shows its power".<sup>20 </sup>This is the luminous principle expressed by the Second Vatican Council which I
have so powerfully experienced in my own life and have made the basis of my
episcopal motto:<i> Totus Tuus</i>.<sup>21 </sup>The motto is of course inspired by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09384a.htm">Saint Louis Marie Grignion
de Montfort</a>, who explained in the following words <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> role in the process of
our configuration to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>:<i> "Our entire perfection consists in being
conformed, united and consecrated to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></i>. Hence the most perfect of
all <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a> is undoubtedly that which conforms, unites and consecrates us most
perfectly to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Now, since <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> is of all creatures the one most
conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, it follows that among all <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a> that which most
consecrates and conforms a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to our Lord is <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to Mary</a>, his Holy
Mother, and that the more a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is consecrated to her the more will it be
consecrated to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>".<sup>22 </sup>Never as in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> do the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Jesus</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> appear so deeply
joined. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> lives only in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>!</p>
<p><i><b>Praying to Christ with Mary</b></i></p>
<p>16. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> invited us to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with insistence and the confidence that we
will be heard: "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
knock, and it will be opened to you" (<i>Mt</i> 7:7). The basis for this power
of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the goodness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also the mediation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
himself (cf. <i>1Jn </i>2:1) and the working of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who
"intercedes for us" according to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. <i>Rom </i>8:26-27).
For "we do not know how to pray as we ought" (<i>Rom</i> 8:26), and at times
we are not heard "because we ask wrongly" (cf. <i>Jas </i>4:2-3).</p>
<p>In support of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> cause to rise in our
hearts, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> intervenes with her maternal <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is sustained by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>".<sup>23 </sup>If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the one Mediator, is the Way of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, then <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, his purest and
most transparent reflection, shows us the Way. "Beginning with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> unique
cooperation with the working of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> developed their
<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Holy Mother of God, centering it on the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
manifested in his mysteries".<sup>24 </sup>At the wedding of <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> the Gospel clearly shows the power of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a>
<a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> as she makes known to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the needs of others: "They have no
wine" (<i>Jn</i> 2:3).</p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is both meditation and supplication. Insistent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Mother
of God is based on confidence that her maternal <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> can obtain all
things from the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">heart of her Son</a>. She is "all-powerful by grace", to use the
bold expression, which needs to be properly understood, of Blessed Bartolo Longo
in his<i> Supplication to Our Lady</i>.<sup>25 </sup>This is a conviction which, beginning with the Gospel, has grown ever more firm
in the experience of the Christian people. The supreme poet <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> expresses it
marvellously in the lines sung by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Saint Bernard</a>: "Lady, thou art so great and
so powerful, that whoever desires grace yet does not turn to thee, would have
his desire fly without wings".<sup>26 </sup>When in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> we plead with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (cf. <i>Lk
</i>1:35), she intercedes for us before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who filled her with grace and
before the Son born of her womb, praying with us and for us.</p>
<p><i><b>Proclaiming Christ with Mary</b></i></p>
<p>17. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is also <i>a path of proclamation and increasing knowledge</i>,
in which the mystery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is presented again and again at different levels
of the Christian experience. Its form is that of a prayerful and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a>
presentation, capable of forming Christians according to the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">heart of Christ</a>.
When the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> combines all the elements needed for an
effective meditation, especially in its communal celebration in parishes and
shrines, it can present <i>a significant catechetical opportunity </i>which
pastors should use to advantage. In this way too Our Lady of the Rosary
continues her work of proclaiming <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The history of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> shows how
this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was used in particular by the Dominicans at a difficult time for the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> due to the spread of <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">heresy</a>. Today we are facing new challenges. Why
should we not once more have recourse to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, with the same faith as
those who have gone before us? The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> retains all its power and continues to
be a valuable pastoral resource for every good evangelizer.</p>

<p align="center"><b>MYSTERIES OF CHRIST –
<br>
MYSTERIES OF HIS MOTHER</b></p>
<p><i><b>The Rosary, "a compendium of the Gospel"</b></i></p>
<p>18. The only way to approach the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> face is by listening
in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> voice, since "no one knows the Son except the
<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>" (<i>Mt</i> 11:27). In the region of <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> responded
to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> confession of faith by indicating the source of that clear intuition
of his identity: "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>
who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<i>Mt</i> 16:17). What is needed, then, is a revelation
from above. In order to receive that revelation, attentive listening is
indispensable: "Only<i> the experience of silence and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></i> offers the
proper setting for the growth and development of a true, faithful and consistent
knowledge of that mystery".<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is one of the traditional paths of Christian prayer directed to the
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> face. Pope Paul VI described it in these words: "As
a Gospel prayer, centred on the mystery of the redemptive <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with a clearly <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> orientation. Its most characteristic
element, in fact, the litany-like succession of<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a></i>, becomes in
itself an unceasing praise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the ultimate object both of the
Angel's announcement and of the greeting of the <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Mother of John the Baptist</a>:
'Blessed is the fruit of your womb' (<i>Lk</i> 1:42). We would go further and
say that the succession of<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a> </i>constitutes the warp on which is
woven the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the mysteries. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that each<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> </i>recalls
is the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom the succession of mysteries proposes to us now as the Son
of God, now as the Son of the Virgin".<sup>28</sup></p>
<p><i><b>A proposed addition to the traditional pattern</b></i></p>
<p>19. Of the many mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Christ's life</a>, only a few are indicated by the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> in the form that has become generally established with the seal of the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> approval. The selection was determined by the origin of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,
which was based on the number 150, the number of the Psalms in the Psalter.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that to bring out fully the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> depth of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> it would be suitable to make an addition to the traditional pattern
which, while left to the freedom of individuals and communities, could broaden
it to include <i>the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> public ministry between his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and his Passion</i>. In the course of those mysteries we <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> important aspects of the
person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the definitive revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Declared the beloved Son
of the Father at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the one who announces the
coming of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a>, bears witness to it in his works and proclaims its
demands. It is during the years of his public ministry that <i>the mystery of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is most evidently a mystery of light: </i>"While I am in the world, I
am the light of the world" (<i>Jn</i> 9:5).</p>
<p>Consequently, for the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> to become more fully a "compendium of the
Gospel", it is fitting to add, following reflection on the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and the
hidden <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a> (<i>the joyful mysteries</i>) and before focusing on the
sufferings of his Passion (<i>the sorrowful mysteries</i>) and the triumph of
his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<i>the glorious mysteries</i>), a meditation on certain
particularly significant moments in his public ministry (<i>the mysteries of
light</i>). This addition of these new mysteries, without prejudice to any
essential aspect of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer's</a> traditional format, is meant to give it fresh
life and to enkindle renewed interest in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary's</a> place within Christian
spirituality as a true doorway to the depths of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Christ</a>, ocean of
joy and of light, of suffering and of glory.</p>
<p><i><b>The Joyful Mysteries</b></i></p>
<p>20. The first five decades, the "joyful mysteries", are marked by <i>the joy
radiating from the event of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a></i>. This is clear from the very
first mystery, the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Gabriel's</a> greeting to the Virgin of
<a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> is linked to an invitation to messianic joy: "Rejoice, Mary". The
whole of salvation history, in some sense the entire history of the world, has
led up to this greeting. If it is the Father's plan to unite all things in
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (cf. <i>Eph </i>1:10), then the whole of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is in some way
touched by the divine favour with which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> looks upon <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> and makes her
the Mother of his Son. The whole of humanity, in turn, is embraced by the<i>
fiat</i> with which she readily agrees to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
<p>Exultation is the keynote of the encounter with <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, where the sound of
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> voice and the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in her womb cause <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> to "leap for
joy" (cf. <i>Lk </i>1:44). Gladness also fills the scene in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, when
the birth of the divine Child, the Saviour of the world, is announced by the
song of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and proclaimed to the shepherds as "news of great joy" (<i>Lk</i>
2:10).</p>
<p>The final two mysteries, while preserving this climate of joy, already point to
the drama yet to come. The Presentation in the Temple not only expresses the joy
of the Child's consecration and the ecstasy of the aged Simeon; it also records
the prophecy that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will be a "sign of contradiction" for Israel and
that a sword will pierce his <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">mother's heart</a> (cf <i>Lk </i>2:34-35). Joy mixed
with drama marks the fifth mystery, the finding of the twelve-year-old <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in
the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>. Here he appears in his divine wisdom as he listens and raises
questions, already in effect one who "teaches". The revelation of his
mystery as the Son wholly dedicated to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> affairs proclaims the
radical nature of the Gospel, in which even the closest of human relationships
are challenged by the absolute demands of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a>. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> and <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, fearful
and anxious, "did not understand" his words (<i>Lk</i> 2:50).</p>
<p>To meditate upon the "joyful" mysteries, then, is to enter into the ultimate
causes and the deepest meaning of Christian joy. It is to focus on the realism
of the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and on the obscure foreshadowing of the
mystery of the saving Passion. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> leads us to discover the secret of Christian
joy, reminding us that Christianity is, first and foremost, <i>euangelion</i>,
"good news", which has as its heart and its whole content the person of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Word made flesh, the one Saviour of the world.</p>
<p><i><b>The Mysteries of Light</b></i></p>
<p>21. Moving on from the infancy and the hidden life in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> to the public
life of Jesus, our <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> brings us to those mysteries which may be
called in a special way "mysteries of light". Certainly the whole mystery of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a mystery of light. He is the "light of the world" (<i>Jn</i>
8:12). Yet this truth emerges in a special way during the years of his public
life, when he proclaims the Gospel of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a>. In proposing to the Christian
community five significant moments – "luminous" mysteries – during this
phase of <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Christ's life</a>, I think that the following can be fittingly singled out:
(1) his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, (2) his self-manifestation at the wedding of
<a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, (3) his proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, with his call to conversion,
(4) his <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a>, and finally, (5) his institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, as
the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> expression of the Paschal Mystery.</p>
<p>Each of these mysteries is <i>a revelation of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> now present in the
very person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. </i>The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> is first of all a mystery of
light. Here, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> descends into the waters, the innocent one who became
"sin" for our sake (cf. <i>2Cor </i>5:21), the heavens open wide and the
voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> declares him the beloved Son (cf. <i>Mt </i>3:17 and
parallels), while the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> descends on him to invest him with the mission
which he is to carry out. Another mystery of light is the first of the signs,
given at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> (cf. <i>Jn </i>2:1-12), when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> changes water into wine and
opens the hearts of the disciples to faith, thanks to the intervention of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>,
the first among believers. Another mystery of light is the preaching by which
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> proclaims the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, calls to conversion (cf. <i>Mk</i>
1:15) and forgives the sins of all who draw near to him in humble trust (cf. <i>Mk
</i>2:3-13; <i>Lk </i>7:47-48): the inauguration of that ministry of mercy
which he continues to exercise until the end of the world, particularly through
the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Reconciliation</a> which he has entrusted to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (cf. <i>Jn </i>20:22-23).
The mystery of light<i> par excellence</i> is the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a>, traditionally
believed to have taken place on <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Tabor</a>. The glory of the Godhead shines
forth from the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> commands the astonished <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to
"listen to him" (cf. <i>Lk </i>9:35 and parallels) and to prepare to
experience with him the agony of the Passion, so as to come with him to the joy
of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and a life transfigured by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. A final mystery
of light is the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offers his body
and blood as food under the signs of bread and wine, and testifies "to the
end" his love for humanity (<i>Jn</i> 13:1), for whose salvation he will offer
himself in sacrifice.</p>
<p>In these mysteries, apart from the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, <i>the presence of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>
remains in the background.</i> The Gospels make only the briefest reference to
her occasional presence at one moment or other during the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>
(cf. <i>Mk </i>3:31-5; <i>Jn</i> 2:12), and they give no indication that she was
present at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> and the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. Yet the role
she assumed at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> in some way accompanies <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> throughout his ministry. The
revelation made directly by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and echoed
by <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> is placed upon <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> lips at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, and it becomes the great
maternal counsel which <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> addresses to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of every age: "Do whatever
he tells you" (<i>Jn</i> 2:5). This counsel is a fitting introduction to the
words and signs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> public ministry and it forms the Marian foundation
of all the "mysteries of light".</p>
<p><i><b>The Sorrowful Mysteries</b></i></p>
<p>22. The Gospels give great prominence to the sorrowful mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. From
the beginning Christian piety, especially during the Lenten <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> of the <i>Way
of the Cross</i>, has focused on the individual moments of the Passion,
realizing that here is found <i>the culmination of the revelation of God's love </i>and
the source of our salvation. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> selects certain moments from the
Passion, inviting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> them in their hearts and to relive
them. The sequence of meditations begins with Gethsemane, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
experiences a moment of great anguish before the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, against
which the weakness of the flesh would be tempted to rebel. There <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>
encounters all the temptations and confronts all the sins of humanity, in order
to say to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: "Not my will but yours be done" (<i>Lk</i> 22:42 and
parallels). This "Yes" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reverses the "No" of our first parents
in the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Garden of Eden</a>. And the cost of this faithfulness to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> will is
made clear in the following mysteries; by his scourging, his crowning with
thorns, his carrying the Cross and his death on the Cross, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> is cast into
the most abject suffering: <i>Ecce homo!</i></p>
<p>This abject suffering reveals not only the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also the meaning of
man himself.</p>
<p><i>Ecce homo</i>: the meaning, origin and fulfilment of man is to be found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>
who humbles himself out of love "even unto death, death on a cross" (<i>Phil
</i>2:8). The sorrowful mysteries help the believer to relive the death of
Jesus, to stand at the foot of the Cross beside <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, to enter with her into the
depths of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love for man and to experience all its life-giving power.</p>
<p><i><b>The Glorious Mysteries</b></i></p>
<p>23. "The <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> face cannot stop at the image of the
Crucified One. He is the Risen One!"<sup>29 </sup>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> has always expressed this knowledge born of faith and invited the
believer to pass beyond the darkness of the Passion in order to gaze upon
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> glory in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>. <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Contemplating</a> the Risen One,
Christians <i>rediscover the reasons for their own faith </i>(cf. <i>1Cor </i>15:14)
and relive the joy not only of those to whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared – the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>,
<a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> and the disciples on the road to Emmaus – but also <i>the joy of
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a></i>, who must have had an equally intense experience of the new life of her
glorified Son. In the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was raised in glory to the right hand of
the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> herself would be raised to that same glory in the
<a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a>, enjoying beforehand, by a unique privilege, the destiny reserved for
all the just at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>. Crowned in glory – as she appears
in the last glorious mystery – <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> shines forth as Queen of the Angels and
<a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a>, the anticipation and the supreme realization of the eschatological state
of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
<p>At the centre of this unfolding sequence of the glory of the Son and the Mother,
the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> sets before us the third glorious mystery, <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>, which reveals
the face of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a family gathered together with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, enlivened by the
powerful outpouring of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and ready for the mission of evangelization.
The <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of this scene, like that of the other glorious mysteries,
ought to lead the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to an ever greater appreciation of their new life in
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lived in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a life of which the scene of <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>
itself is the great "icon". The glorious mysteries thus lead the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to
<i>greater hope for the eschatological goal </i>towards which they journey as
members of the pilgrim People of God in history. This can only impel them to
bear courageous witness to that "good news" which gives meaning to their
entire existence.</p>
<p><i><b>From "mysteries" to the "Mystery": Mary's way</b></i></p>
<p>24. The cycles of meditation proposed by the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a> are by no means
exhaustive, but they do bring to mind what is essential and they awaken in the
<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a thirst for a knowledge of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> continually nourished by the pure source
of the Gospel. Every individual event in the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a>, as narrated by the
Evangelists, is resplendent with the Mystery that surpasses all understanding
(cf. <i>Eph </i>3:19): the Mystery of the Word made flesh, in whom "all the
fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwells bodily" (<i>Col </i>2:9). For this reason the<i>
Catechism of the Catholic Church </i>places great emphasis on the mysteries of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, pointing out that "everything in the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Jesus</a> is a sign of his
Mystery".<sup>30 </sup>The <i>"duc in altum" </i>of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the third millennium will be
determined by the ability of Christians to enter into the "perfect knowledge
of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mystery, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge" (<i>Col </i>2:2-3). The Letter to the Ephesians makes this
heartfelt <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for all the baptized: "May <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwell in your hearts
through faith, so that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have power...
to know the love of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled
with all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (3:17-19).</p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is at the service of this ideal; it offers the "secret" which
leads easily to a profound and inward knowledge of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We might call it <i><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a>
way</i>. It is the way of the example of the Virgin of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, a woman of
faith, of silence, of attentive listening. It is also the way of a <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">Marian
devotion</a> inspired by knowledge of the inseparable bond between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a>: <i>the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> </i>are also in some sense <i>the
mysteries of his Mother</i>, even when they do not involve her directly, for she
lives from him and through him. By making our own the words of the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Angel Gabriel</a>
and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Saint Elizabeth</a> contained in the<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>, we find ourselves
constantly drawn to seek out afresh in <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, in her arms and in her <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">heart</a>, the
"blessed fruit of her womb" (cf <i>Lk </i>1:42).</p>
<p><i><b>Mystery of Christ, mystery of man</b></i></p>
<p>25. In my testimony of 1978 mentioned above, where I described the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> as my
favourite <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, I used an idea to which I would like to return. I said then
that "the simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> marks the rhythm of human life".<sup>31</sup></p>
<p>In the light of what has been said so far on the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is not
difficult to go deeper into this <i>anthropological significance </i>of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, which is far deeper than may appear at first sight. Anyone who
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplates</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through the various <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">stages of his life</a> cannot fail to
perceive in him <i>the truth about man</i>. This is the great affirmation of the
Second Vatican Council which I have so often discussed in my own teaching since
the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical Letter</a> <i>Redemptor Hominis</i>: "it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man is
seen in its true light".<sup>32 </sup>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> helps to open up the way to this light. Following in the path of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom man's path is "recapitulated",<sup>33 </sup>revealed and redeemed, believers come face to face with the image of the true
man. <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Contemplating</a> Christ's birth, they learn of the sanctity of life; seeing
the household of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, they learn the original truth of the family according
to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> plan; listening to the Master in the mysteries of his public ministry,
they find the light which leads them to enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>; and following
him on the way to Calvary, they learn the meaning of salvific suffering.
Finally, <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplating</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a> in glory, they see the goal
towards which each of us is called, if we allow ourselves to be healed and
transformed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. It could be said that each mystery of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, carefully meditated, sheds light on the mystery of man.</p>
<p>At the same time, it becomes natural to bring to this encounter with the sacred
humanity of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a> all the problems, anxieties, labours and endeavours
which go to make up our lives. "Cast your burden on the Lord and he will
sustain you" (<i>Ps </i>55:23). To pray the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is to hand over our burdens
to the merciful hearts of <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">Mother</a>. Twenty-five years later,
thinking back over the difficulties which have also been part of my exercise of the Petrine ministry, I feel the need to say
once more, as a warm invitation to everyone to experience it personally: the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> does indeed "mark the rhythm of human life", bringing it into harmony
with the "rhythm" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own life, in the joyful communion of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy
Trinity</a>, our life's destiny and deepest longing.</p>
<p></p>

<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>"FOR ME, TO LIVE IS CHRIST"</b></p>
<p><i><b>The Rosary, a way of assimilating the mystery</b></i></p>
<p>26. Meditation on the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is proposed in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> by means of
a method designed to assist in their assimilation. It is a method <i>based on
repetition</i>. This applies above all to the<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>, repeated ten
times in each mystery. If this repetition is considered superficially, there
could be a temptation to see the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> as a dry and boring exercise. It is
quite another thing, however, when the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is thought of as an outpouring of
that love which tirelessly returns to the person loved with expressions similar
in their content but ever fresh in terms of the feeling pervading them.</p>
<p>In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has truly assumed a <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">"heart of flesh"</a>. Not only does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have
a divine heart, rich in mercy and in forgiveness, but also a <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">human heart</a>,
capable of all the stirrings of affection. If we needed evidence for this from
the Gospel, we could easily find it in the touching dialogue between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and
<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: "<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, son of John</a>, do you love me?" Three
times this question is put to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and three times he gives the reply:
"Lord, you know that I love you" (cf. <i>Jn </i>21:15-17). Over and above
the specific meaning of this passage, so important for <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> mission, none can
fail to recognize the beauty of this triple repetition, in which the insistent
request and the corresponding reply are expressed in terms familiar from the
universal experience of human love. To understand the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, one has to enter
into the psychological dynamic proper to love.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: although the repeated<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> </i>is addressed directly
to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, it is to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that the act of love is ultimately directed, with her
and through her. The repetition is nourished by the desire to be conformed ever
more completely to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the true programme of the Christian life. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a>
expressed this project with words of fire: "For me to live is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and to
die is gain" (<i>Phil </i>1:21). And again: "It is no longer I that live,
but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> lives in me" (<i>Gal</i> 2:20). The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> helps us to be conformed
ever more closely to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> until we attain true <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>A valid method...</b></i></p>
<p>27. We should not be surprised that our relationship with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> makes use of a
method. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> communicates himself to us respecting our human nature and its vital
rhythms. Hence, while Christian spirituality is familiar with the most sublime
forms of mystical silence in which images, words and gestures are all, so to
speak, superseded by an intense and ineffable union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it normally
engages the whole person in all his complex psychological, physical and
relational reality.</p>
<p>This becomes apparent <i>in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>. </i><a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> are
structured as a series of rites which bring into play all the dimensions of the
person. The same applies to non-liturgical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. This is confirmed by the fact
that, in the East, the most characteristic <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> meditation,
centred on the words "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Son of God, have mercy on me, a
sinner"<sup>34 </sup>is traditionally linked to the rhythm of breathing; while this practice favours
perseverance in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it also in some way embodies the desire for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
to become the breath, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the "all" of one's life.</p>
<p><i><b>... which can nevertheless be improved</b></i></p>
<p>28. I mentioned in my Apostolic Letter <i>Novo Millennio Ineunte</i> that the
West is now experiencing <i>a renewed demand for meditation</i>, which at times
leads to a keen interest in aspects of other religions.<sup>35 </sup>Some Christians, limited in their knowledge of the Christian <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a>
tradition, are attracted by those forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. While the latter contain many
elements which are positive and at times compatible with Christian experience,
they are often based on ultimately unacceptable premises. Much in vogue among
these approaches are methods aimed at attaining a high level of spiritual
concentration by using techniques of a psychophysical, repetitive and symbolic
nature. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is situated within this broad gamut of religious phenomena,
but it is distinguished by characteristics of its own which correspond to
specifically Christian requirements.</p>
<p>In effect, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is simply <i>a method of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</i> As a method,
it serves as a means to an end and cannot become an end in itself. All the same,
as the fruit of centuries of experience, this method should not be undervalued.
In its favour one could cite the experience of countless <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a>. This is not to
say, however, that the method cannot be improved. Such is the intent of the
addition of the new series of <i>mysteria lucis </i>to the overall cycle of
mysteries and of the few suggestions which I am proposing in this Letter
regarding its manner of recitation. These suggestions, while respecting the
well-established structure of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, are intended to help the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to
understand it in the richness of its symbolism and in harmony with the demands
of daily life. Otherwise there is a risk that the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> would not only fail to
produce the intended spiritual effects, but even that the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>, with which it
is usually said, could come to be regarded as some kind of amulet or magic
object, thereby radically distorting their meaning and function.</p>
<p><i><b>Announcing each mystery</b></i></p>
<p>29. Announcing each mystery, and perhaps even using a suitable icon to portray
it, is as it were <i>to open up a scenario </i>on which to focus our attention.
The words direct the imagination and the mind towards a particular episode or
moment in the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> traditional spirituality, the
veneration of icons and the many <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a> appealing to the senses, as well as
the method of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> proposed by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Saint Ignatius of Loyola</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14224b.htm">Spiritual Exercises</a>, make use of visual and imaginative elements (the <i>compositio loci</i>),
judged to be of great help in concentrating the mind on the particular mystery.
This is a methodology, moreover, which<i> corresponds to the inner logic of the
<a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>: </i>in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wanted to take on human features. It is through
his bodily reality that we are led into contact with the mystery of his
divinity.</p>
<p>This need for concreteness finds further expression in the announcement of the
various mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. Obviously these mysteries neither replace the
Gospel nor exhaust its content. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, therefore, is no substitute for <i>lectio
divina</i>; on the contrary, it presupposes and promotes it. Yet, even though
the mysteries <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, even with the addition of the<i>
mysteria lucis</i>, do no more than outline the fundamental elements of the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life
of Christ</a>, they easily draw the mind to a more expansive reflection on the rest
of the Gospel, especially when the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is prayed in a setting of prolonged
recollection.</p>
<p><i><b>Listening to the word of God</b></i></p>
<p>30. In order to supply a <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> foundation and greater depth to our
meditation, it is helpful to follow the announcement of the mystery with<i> the
proclamation of a related <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> passage</i>, long or short, depending on the
circumstances. No other words can ever match the efficacy of the inspired word.
As we listen, we are certain that this is the word of God, spoken for today and
spoken "for me".</p>
<p>If received in this way, the word of God can become part of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary's</a>
methodology of repetition without giving rise to the ennui derived from the
simple recollection of something already well known. It is not a matter of
recalling information but of <i>allowing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to speak. </i>In certain solemn
communal celebrations, this word can be appropriately illustrated by a brief
commentary.</p>
<p><i><b>Silence</b></i></p>
<p>31. <i>Listening and meditation are nourished by silence.</i> After the
announcement of the mystery and the proclamation of the word, it is fitting to
pause and focus one's attention for a suitable period of time on the mystery
concerned, before moving into vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. A discovery of the importance of
silence is one of the secrets of practicing <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and meditation. One
drawback of a society dominated by technology and the mass media is the fact
that silence becomes increasingly difficult to achieve. Just as moments of
silence are recommended in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, so too in the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
it is fitting to pause briefly after listening to the word of God, while the
mind focuses on the content of a particular mystery.</p>
<p><i><b>The "Our Father"</b></i></p>
<p>32. After listening to the word and focusing on the mystery, it is natural for <i>the
mind to be lifted up towards the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a></i>. In each of his mysteries, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>
always leads us to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for as he rests in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> bosom (cf. <i>Jn </i>1:18)
he is continually turned towards him. He wants us to share in his intimacy with
the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so that we can say with him: "Abba, Father" (<i>Rom </i>8:15; <i>Gal</i>
4:6). By virtue of his relationship to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> he makes us brothers and
sisters of himself and of one another, communicating to us the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> which is
both his and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a>. Acting as a kind of foundation for the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a>
and Marian meditation which unfolds in the repetition of the<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>,
the <i><a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a></i> makes meditation upon the mystery, even when carried out
in solitude, an ecclesial experience.</p>
<p><b><i>The ten "Hail Marys</i>"</b></p>
<p>33. This is the most substantial element in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and also the one which
makes it a Marian <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <i>par excellence</i>. Yet when the<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> </i>is
properly understood, we come to see clearly that its Marian character is not
opposed to its <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> character, but that it actually emphasizes and
increases it. The first part of the <i><a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>, drawn from the words
spoken to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Angel Gabriel</a> and by <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Saint Elizabeth</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>
in adoration of the mystery accomplished in the Virgin of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. These words
express, so to speak, the wonder of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth; they could be said to give
us a glimpse of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own wonderment as he <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplates</a> his "masterpiece"
– the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Son in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. If we recall how,
in the Book of Genesis, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "saw all that he had made" (<i>Gen </i>1:31), we
can find here an echo of that "pathos with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the dawn of creation,
looked upon the work of his hands".<sup>36</sup>The repetition of the <i><a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i> in the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> gives us a share in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>
own wonder and pleasure: in jubilant amazement we acknowledge the greatest
<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of history. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> prophecy here finds its fulfilment: "Henceforth all
generations will call me blessed" (<i>Lk</i> 1:48).</p>
<p>The centre of gravity in the <i><a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>, the hinge as it were which joins
its two parts, is <i>the name of Jesus.</i> Sometimes, in hurried recitation,
this centre of gravity can be overlooked, and with it the connection to the
mystery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplated</a>. Yet it is precisely the emphasis given to the name of Jesus and to his mystery that is the sign of a
meaningful and fruitful recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. Pope Paul VI drew attention,
in his Apostolic Exhortation<i> Marialis Cultus</i>, to the custom in certain
regions of highlighting the name of Christ by the addition of a clause referring
to the mystery being <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplated</a>.<sup>37 </sup>This is a praiseworthy custom, especially during public recitation. It gives
forceful expression to our faith in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, directed to the different moments of
the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Redeemer's life</a>. It is at once <i>a profession of faith </i>and an aid in
concentrating our meditation, since it facilitates the process of assimilation
to the mystery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inherent in the repetition of the<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a></i>.
When we repeat the name of Jesus – the only name given to us by which we may
hope for salvation (cf. <i>Acts </i>4:12) – in close association with the name
of his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a>, almost as if it were done at her suggestion, we set out
on a path of assimilation meant to help us enter more deeply into the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of
Christ</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> uniquely privileged relationship with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which makes her the
Mother of God, <i>Theotókos</i>, derives the forcefulness of the appeal we make
to her in the second half of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as we entrust to her maternal
<a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> our lives and the hour of our death.</p>
<p><i><b>The "Gloria"</b></i></p>
<p>34. Trinitarian doxology is the goal of all <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Christian contemplation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>
is the way that leads us to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. If we travel this way to
the end, we repeatedly encounter the mystery of the three divine Persons, to
whom all praise, worship and thanksgiving are due. It is important that the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm"><i>Gloria</i></a>, <i>the high-point of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a></i>, be given due prominence in
the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. In public recitation it could be sung, as a way of giving proper
emphasis to the essentially Trinitarian structure of all Christian prayer.</p>
<p>To the extent that meditation on the mystery is attentive and profound, and to
the extent that it is enlivened – from one<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Mary</a> </i>to another – by love
for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and for <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the glorification of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> at the end of each
decade, far from being a perfunctory conclusion, takes on its proper
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a> tone, raising the mind as it were to the heights of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and
enabling us in some way to relive the experience of <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Tabor</a>, a foretaste of the
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> yet to come: "It is good for us to be here!" (<i>Lk</i> 9:33).</p>
<p><i><b>The concluding short prayer</b></i></p>
<p>35. In current practice, the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">Trinitarian doxology</a> is followed by a brief
concluding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which varies according to local custom. Without in any way
diminishing the value of such invocations, it is worthwhile to note that the
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the mysteries could better express their full spiritual
fruitfulness if an effort were made to conclude each mystery with <i>a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>
for the fruits specific to that particular mystery</i>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
would better express its connection with the Christian life. One fine <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>
prayer suggests as much, inviting us to pray that, by meditation on the
mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, we may come to "imitate what they contain and obtain
what they promise".<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>Such a final <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> could take on a legitimate variety of forms, as indeed it
already does. In this way the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> can be better adapted to different
spiritual traditions and different Christian communities. It is to be hoped,
then, that appropriate formulas will be widely circulated, after due pastoral
discernment and possibly after experimental use in centres and shrines
particularly devoted to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, so that the People of God may benefit from
an abundance of authentic spiritual riches and find nourishment for their
personal <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>The Rosary beads</b></i></p>
<p>36. The traditional aid used for the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is the set of
<a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>. At the most superficial level, the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> often become a simple counting mechanism to mark the
succession of<i> <a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a></i>. Yet they can also take on a symbolism which can
give added depth to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>
<p>Here the first thing to note is the way <i>the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> converge upon the Crucifix</i>,
which both opens and closes the unfolding sequence of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The life and
<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of believers is centred upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Everything begins from him,
everything leads towards him, everything, through him, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,
attains to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</p>
<p>As a counting mechanism, marking the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> evoke the
unending path of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and of Christian perfection. Blessed Bartolo
Longo saw them also as a "chain" which links us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A chain, yes, but a
sweet chain; for sweet indeed is the bond to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is also our Father. A
"filial" chain which puts us in tune with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the "handmaid of the
Lord" (<i>Lk</i> 1:38) and, most of all, with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, who, though he
was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made himself a "servant" out of love for us (<i>Phil
</i>2:7).</p>
<p>A fine way to expand the symbolism of the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a> is to let them remind us of our
many relationships, of the bond of communion and fraternity which unites us all
in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>The opening and closing</b></i></p>
<p>37. At present, in different parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, there are many ways to
introduce the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. In some places, it is customary to begin with the opening
words of Psalm 70: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, come to my aid; O Lord, make haste to help me",
as if to nourish in those who are praying a humble awareness of their own
insufficiency. In other places, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> begins with the recitation of the
Creed, as if to make the profession of faith the basis of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a>
journey about to be undertaken. These and similar customs, to the extent that
they prepare the mind for <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, are all equally legitimate. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
is then ended with a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the intentions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, as if to expand the
vision of the one praying to embrace all the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is
precisely in order to encourage this ecclesial dimension of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> that the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has seen fit to grant indulgences to those who recite it with the
required dispositions.</p>
<p>If prayed in this way, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> truly becomes a spiritual itinerary in which
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> acts as Mother, Teacher and Guide, sustaining the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> by her powerful
<a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>. Is it any wonder, then, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels the need, after saying
this prayer and experiencing so profoundly the motherhood of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, to burst
forth in praise of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, either in that splendid <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/13409a.htm"><i>Salve
Regina </i></a> or in the <a href="../cathen/09287a.htm"><i> Litany of Loreto</i></a>? This is the crowning moment of an
inner journey which has brought the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> into living contact with the
mystery of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Distribution over time</b></i></p>
<p>38. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> can be recited in full every day, and there are those who most
laudably do so. In this way it fills with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the days of many a
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplative</a>, or keeps company with the sick and the elderly who have abundant
time at their disposal. Yet it is clear – and this applies all the more if the
new series of <i>mysteria lucis</i> is included – that many people will not be
able to recite more than a part of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, according to a certain weekly
pattern. This weekly distribution has the effect of giving the different <a href="../cathen/15575b.htm">days of
the week</a> a certain spiritual "colour", by analogy with the way in which the
<a href="../cathen/04134a.htm">Liturgy colours</a> the different seasons of the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">liturgical year</a>.</p>
<p>According to current practice, Monday and Thursday are dedicated to the
"joyful mysteries", Tuesday and Thursday to the "sorrowful mysteries",
and Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday to the "glorious mysteries". Where might
the "mysteries of light" be inserted? If we consider that the "glorious
mysteries" are said on both Saturday and Sunday, and that Saturday has always
had a special Marian flavour, the second weekly meditation on the "joyful
mysteries", mysteries in which <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> presence is especially pronounced, could
be moved to Saturday. Thursday would then be free for meditating on the
"mysteries of light".</p>
<p>This indication is not intended to limit a rightful freedom in personal and
community <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, where account needs to be taken of spiritual and pastoral
needs and of the occurrence of particular <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> celebrations which might
call for suitable adaptations. What is really important is that the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
should always be seen and experienced as a path of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>,
in a way similar to what takes place in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15575b.htm">Christian week</a>, centred
on Sunday, the day of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, becomes a journey through the mysteries of
the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a>, and he is revealed in the lives of his disciples as the Lord
of time and of history.</p>
<p></p>

<p align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><i><b>"Blessed Rosary of Mary, sweet chain linking us to God"</b></i></p>
<p>39. What has been said so far makes abundantly clear the richness of this
traditional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which has the simplicity of a <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">popular devotion</a> but also the
theological depth of a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> suited to those who feel the need for deeper
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always attributed particular efficacy to this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, entrusting
to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, to its choral recitation and to its constant practice, the most
difficult problems. At times when Christianity itself seemed under threat, its
deliverance was attributed to the power of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and Our Lady of the
Rosary was acclaimed as the one whose <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> brought salvation.</p>
<p>Today I willingly entrust to the power of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> – as I mentioned at the
beginning – the cause of peace in the world and the cause of the family.</p>
<p><i><b>Peace</b></i></p>
<p>40. The grave challenges confronting the world at the start of this new
Millennium lead us to think that only an intervention from on high, capable of
guiding the hearts of those living in situations of conflict and those governing
the destinies of nations, can give reason to hope for a brighter future.</p>
<p><i>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is by its nature a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace</i>, since it consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Prince of Peace, the one
who is "our peace" (<i>Eph </i>2:14). Anyone who assimilates the mystery of
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> – and this is clearly the goal of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> – learns the secret of peace
and makes it his life's project. Moreover, by virtue of its meditative
character, with the tranquil succession of <i><a href="../cathen/07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a></i>, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> has a
peaceful effect on those who pray it, disposing them to receive and experience
in their innermost depths, and to spread around them, that true peace which is
the special gift of the Risen Lord (cf. <i>Jn </i>14:27; 20.21).</p>
<p>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is also a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace because of the fruits of charity which it
produces. When prayed well in a truly meditative way, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> leads to an
encounter with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in his mysteries and so cannot fail to draw attention to
the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in others, especially in the most afflicted. How could one
possibly <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> the mystery of the Child of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, in the joyful
mysteries, without experiencing the desire to welcome, defend and promote life,
and to shoulder the burdens of suffering children all over the world? How could
one possibly follow in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Revealer, in the mysteries of
light, without resolving to bear witness to his <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">"Beatitudes"</a> in daily life?
And how could one <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> carrying the Cross and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Crucified,
without feeling the need to act as a "Simon of Cyrene" for our brothers and
sisters weighed down by grief or crushed by despair? Finally, how could one
possibly gaze upon the glory of the Risen Christ or of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary Queen of Heaven</a>,
without yearning to make this world more beautiful, more just, more closely
conformed to God's plan?</p>
<p>In a word, by focusing our eyes on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> also makes us peacemakers
in the world. By its nature as an insistent choral petition in harmony with
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> invitation to "pray ceaselessly" (<i>Lk</i> 18:1), the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
allows us to hope that, even today, the difficult "battle" for peace can be
won. Far from offering an escape from the problems of the world, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>
obliges us to see them with responsible and generous eyes, and obtains for us
the strength to face them with the certainty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help and the firm
intention of bearing witness in every situation to "love, which binds
everything together in perfect harmony" (<i>Col </i>3:14).</p>
<p><i><b>The family: parents...</b></i></p>
<p>41. As a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace, the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is also, and always has been, <i>a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>
of and for the family.</i> At one time this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was particularly dear to
<a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a>, and it certainly brought them closer together. It is
important not to lose this precious inheritance. We need to return to the
practice of family <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, continuing to use the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>.</p>
<p>In my Apostolic Letter <i>Novo Millennio Ineunte</i> I encouraged the
celebration of the
<a href="../cathen/11219a.htm"><i>Liturgy of the Hours</i></a>
by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">lay faithful</a> in the
ordinary life of parish communities and Christian groups;<sup>39 </sup>I now wish to do the same for the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. These two paths of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">Christian
contemplation</a> are not mutually exclusive; they complement one another. I would
therefore ask those who devote themselves to the pastoral care of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> to
recommend heartily the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>.</p>
<p><i>The family that prays together stays together. </i>The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, by age-old tradition, has shown itself particularly effective
as a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which brings the family together. Individual family members, in
turning their eyes towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, also regain the ability to look one another in
the eye, to communicate, to show solidarity, to forgive one another and to see
their covenant of love renewed in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the problems facing contemporary <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, especially in economically
developed societies, result from their increasing difficulty in communicating.
<a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">Families</a> seldom manage to come together, and the rare occasions when they do are
often taken up with watching television. To return to the recitation of the
family Rosary means filling daily life with very different images, images of the mystery of salvation: the image of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>, the image of his
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">most Blessed Mother</a>. The family that recites the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> together reproduces
something of the atmosphere of the household of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>: its members place
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> at the centre, they share his joys and sorrows, they place their needs and
their plans in his hands, they draw from him the hope and the strength to go
on.</p>
<p><i><b>... and children</b></i></p>
<p>42. It is also beautiful and fruitful to entrust to this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <i>the growth
and development of children.</i> Does the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> not follow the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a>,
from his conception to his death, and then to his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and his glory?
Parents are finding it ever more difficult to follow the lives of their children
as they grow to maturity. In a society of advanced technology, of mass
communications and globalization, everything has become hurried, and the
cultural distance between generations is growing ever greater. The most diverse
messages and the most unpredictable experiences rapidly make their way into the
lives of children and adolescents, and parents can become quite anxious about
the dangers their children face. At times parents suffer acute disappointment at
the failure of their children to resist the seductions of the drug culture, the
lure of an unbridled hedonism, the temptation to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and the manifold
expressions of meaninglessness and despair.</p>
<p>To pray the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> <i>for children</i>, and even more, <i>with children</i>,
training them from their earliest years to experience this daily "pause for
<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>" with the family, is admittedly not the solution to every problem, but
it is a spiritual aid which should not be underestimated. It could be objected
that the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> seems hardly suited to the taste of children and young people of
today. But perhaps the objection is directed to an impoverished method of
praying it. Furthermore, without prejudice to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary's</a> basic structure,
there is nothing to stop children and young people from praying it – either
within the family or in groups – with appropriate symbolic and practical aids to
understanding and appreciation. Why not try it? With <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, a pastoral
approach to youth which is positive, impassioned and creative – as shown by the
World Youth Days! – is capable of achieving quite remarkable results. If the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is well presented, I am sure that young people will once more surprise
adults by the way they make this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> their own and recite it with the
enthusiasm typical of their age group.</p>
<p><i><b>The Rosary, a treasure to be rediscovered</b></i></p>
<p>43. Dear brothers and sisters! A <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> so easy and yet so rich truly deserves
to be rediscovered by the Christian community. Let us do so, especially this
year, as a means of confirming the direction outlined in my Apostolic Letter<i>Novo Millennio Ineunte</i>, from which the pastoral plans of so many particular
Churches have drawn inspiration as they look to the immediate future.</p>
<p>I turn particularly to you, my dear Brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and to
you, pastoral agents in your different ministries: through your own personal
experience of the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, may you come to promote it with
conviction.</p>
<p>I also place my trust in you, theologians: by your sage and rigorous reflection,
rooted in the word of God and sensitive to the lived experience of the Christian
people, may you help them to discover the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> foundations, the spiritual
riches and the pastoral value of this traditional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>
<p>I count on you, consecrated men and women, called in a particular way to
<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplate</a> the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the school of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>.</p>
<p>I look to all of you, brothers and sisters of every state of life, to you,
<a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a>, to you, the sick and elderly, and to you, young people: <i>confidently
take up the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> once again. </i>Rediscover the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> in the light of
<a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>, and in the context of your daily lives.</p>
<p>May this appeal of mine not go unheard! At the start of the twenty-fifth year of
my Pontificate, I entrust this Apostolic Letter to the loving hands of the
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, <i>prostrating myself in spirit before her image in the splendid
Shrine built for her by Blessed Bartolo Longo</i>, the apostle of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. I
willingly make my own the touching words with which he concluded his well-known
<i>Supplication to the Queen of the Holy Rosary</i>: "O <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Blessed Rosary</a> of
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, sweet chain which unites us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bond of love which unites us to the
<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, tower of salvation against the assaults of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, safe port in our
universal shipwreck, we will never abandon you. You will be our comfort in the
hour of death: yours our final kiss as life ebbs away. And the last word from
our lips will be your sweet name, O Queen of the Rosary of Pompei, O dearest
Mother, O Refuge of Sinners, O Sovereign Consoler of the Afflicted. May you be
everywhere blessed, today and always, on earth and in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>".</p>
<p><i>From the Vatican, on the 16th day of October in the year 2002, the beginning of
the twenty-fifth year of my Pontificate.</i></p>
