<h1>Saepe Nos</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on Boycotting in Ireland
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>June 24, 1888</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brethren, the Bishops of Ireland.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>FROM THIS SUPREME DIGNITY of the Apostolic office, We have frequently
directed Our solicitude and Our thoughts to your Catholic people; and Our
feelings have been more than once recorded in published documents, from
which all may clearly learn what are Our dispositions towards Ireland. They
are sufficiently attested by the provisions which, under Our direction, the
Sacred Congregation of Propaganda made in former years respecting Ireland,
and also by the letters which on more than one occasion We addressed to Our
Venerable Brother, Cardinal M'Cabe, Archbishop of Dublin. Once again, they
have been attested by the address which We recently delivered to a not
inconsiderable number of Catholics belonging to your nation, from whom we
received, not only congratulations and heartfelt wishes for Our
preservation, but also expressions of gratitude on account of Our
benevolent dispositions, clearly discerned by them, towards the Irish
people. Furthermore, within these past few months, when it was resolved to
build a church in this city in honor of St. Patrick, the great Apostle of
the Irish, We most warmly encouraged the undertaking, and We shall
substantially aid it within the limits of Our resources.

<p>2. Now this, Our paternal affection, remaining, as it does, unaltered, We
cannot disguise that tidings which have recently come to Us from Ireland
have deeply pained and grieved Us. We have learned that an untoward
excitement has suddenly arisen because the Sacred Congregation, whose
office it is to vindicate the authority of the Church against those who
resist it, has decreed that those methods of warfare known as Boycotting
and the Plan of Campaign, which had begun to be employed by many, may not
lawfully be used. And what is more to be deplored, there are not a few who
have come forward and summoned the people to excited meetings, where
inconsiderate and dangerous opinions are set in circulation, the authority
of the Decree not being spared. For not only is the real scope of this
Decree grievously perverted by means of forced interpretations, but,
furthermore, it is even denied that obedience is due to the Decree, as if
it were not the true and proper office of the Church to decide what is
right and what is wrong in human actions.

<p>3. Such a manner of acting is but little in harmony with the profession of
the Christian religion, which assuredly brings in its train the virtues of
moderation, respect, and obedience to legitimate authority. Besides, in a
good cause, it is not fitting to seem in some sense to imitate those who in
the pursuit of an unlawful end seek to attain it by disorderly effort.

<p>4. Such line of action, too, is the more painful to Us inasmuch as We had
carefully inquired into the case, so that We might obtain full and reliable
knowledge of the state of your affairs, and of the causes of popular
discontent. Our sources of information are trustworthy; we investigated the
matter in personal interview with yourselves; further, last year we sent to
you as legate a man of tried prudence and discretion, with the commission
to use the greatest diligence in ascertaining the truth, and to make a
faithful report to Us. For this very act of watchful care the thanks of the
Irish people have been publicly given to Us. Can it therefore be asserted
without rashness that We have given judgment in a case with which We were
not sufficiently acquainted--the more so as We have condemned things which
fair minded men, not mixed up in your struggle, and thus bringing a calmer
judgment to the consideration of the case, unite in condemning?

<p>5. There is also a suspicion not less unjust to Us, namely, that the cause
of Ireland appeals but feebly to Us, and that the present condition of her
people gives Us little care. Now, on the contrary, We yield to no one in
the intensity of Our feeling for the condition of the Irish people, and We
have no more earnest desire than to see them at length in the enjoyment of
that peace and prosperity which they have so well deserved. We have never
opposed their struggling for a better state of things, but can it be
regarded as admissible that in the carrying on of that struggle a way
should be thrown open which might lead to evil deeds Rather, indeed, for
the very reason that, under the influence of passion and political
partisanship, things lawful and unlawful are to be found mingled in the
same cause, it has been Our constant effort to mark off what was right from
what was wrong, and to withhold Catholics from everything not sanctioned by
the Christian rules of morals.

<p>6. On this account We gave to the Irish people timely counsels, to be
mindful of their obligations as Catholics, and to take part in nothing at
variance with natural right or forbidden by the Divine law. Hence the
recent Decree ought not to have come upon them unexpectedly; all the more
as you yourselves, Venerable Brethren, assembled in Dublin in the year 1881
bade the clergy and people to beware of everything contrary to public order
or to charity--such as refusing to discharge just obligations; preventing
others from discharging theirs; inflicting injury on anyone either in
person or property; violently resisting the law or those engaged in the
discharge of public duties; joining in secret societies and the like. These
injunctions, most just in themselves and given most seasonably, were
praised and approved by Us.

<p>7. Nevertheless, as the people were being carried away by ever-increasing
vehemence in the pursuit of the object of their desires, and as there were
not wanting those who daily fanned the flame, We perceived that something
more definite was needed than the general precepts of justice and charity
which We had previously given. Our duty forbade us to suffer that so many
Catholics, whose salvation must be Our first care, should pursue a
hazardous and unsafe course leading rather to disorder than to the relief
of distress.

<p>8. Let matters, then, be viewed in their true light, and let Ireland read
in this Decree Our love for herself and Our desire to promote the
prosperity she hopes for; since nothing is so harmful to a cause, however
just, as recourse to violence and injustice in its defense.

<p>9. These instructions which We address to you, Venerable Brethren, you will
convey to the Irish people. We feel confident that, united in due
conformity of views and of purpose, and sustained not only by your own, but
also by Our authority, you will accomplish much--and chiefly this, that the
true estimate of things shall not continue to be obscured by passion, and
most especially that those who have urged on the people to excitement may
come to regret the rashness with which they have acted. Since there are
many who seem to seek out means of escaping from even the plainest
obligations, take all necessary steps that no room be left for doubt as to
the force of this Decree. Let it be understood by all that the entire
method of action, whose employment We have forbidden, is forbidden as
altogether unlawful.

<p>10. Let your people seek to advance their lawful interests by lawful means,
and most especially, as is becoming in Christians, without prejudice to
justice or to obedience to the Apostolic See, virtues in which Ireland has
in al times found comfort and strength.

<p>11. In the meantime, Venerable Brethren, as a pledge of heavenly favors,
and in testimony of Our affection, We most lovingly in the Lord bestow on
you, and on the clergy and people of Ireland, the Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Given at St. Peter's, Rome, the 24th day of June, in the year
 1888, the eleventh year of Our Pontificate.
