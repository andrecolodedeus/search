<h1>Sapientia Christiana</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Constitution on Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties
<br>His Holiness Pope John Paul II
<br>Given on April 15, 1979</b>

<p><i>John Paul, Bishop. Servant of the Servants of God for Perpetual Remembrance.</i>

<p align=center><b>I. FOREWORD</b></p>

<p>Christian wisdom, which the Church teaches by divine authority,
continuously inspires the faithful of Christ zealously to endeavor to
relate human affairs and activities with religious values in a single
living synthesis. Under the direction of these values all things are
mutually connected for the glory of God and the integral development of
the human person, a development that includes both corporal and spiritual
well-being.[1]

<p>Indeed, the Church's mission of spreading the Gospel not only demands
that the Good News be preached ever more widely and to ever greater
numbers of men and women, but that the very power of the Gospel should
permeate thought patterns, standards of judgment, and norms of behavior;
in a word, it is necessary that the whole of human culture be steeped in
the Gospel.[2]

<p>The cultural atmosphere in which a human being lives has a great
influence upon his or her way of thinking and, thus, of acting.
Therefore, a division between faith and culture is more than a small
impediment to evangelization, while a culture penetrated with the
Christian spirit is an instrument that favors the spreading of the Good
News.

<p>Furthermore, the Gospel is intended for all peoples of every age and land
and is not bound exclusively to any particular culture. It is valid for
pervading all cultures so as to illumine them with the light of divine
revelation and to purify human conduct, renewing them in Christ.

<p>For this reason, the Church of Christ strives to bring the Good News to
every sector of humanity so as to be able to convert the consciences of
human beings, both individually and collectively, and to fill with the
light of the Gospel their works and undertakings, their entire lives,
and, indeed, the whole of the social environment in which they are
engaged. In this way the Church carries out her mission of evangelizing
also by advancing human culture.[3]

<p align=center><b>II.</b></p>

<p>In this activity of the Church with regard to culture, Catholic
universities have had and still have special importance. By their nature
they aim to secure that "the Christian outlook should acquire a public,
stable, and universal influence in the whole process of the promotion of
higher culture."[4]

<p>In fact, as my Predecessor Pope Pius XI recalled in the preface to the
Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus,[5] there arose within
the Church, from her earliest period, didascaleia for imparting
instruction in Christian wisdom so that people's lives and conduct might
be formed. From these houses of Christian wisdom the most illustrious
Fathers and Doctors of the Church, teachers and ecclesiastical writers,
drew their knowledge.

<p>With the passing of centuries schools were established in the
neighborhood of cathedrals and monasteries, thanks especially to the
zealous initiatives of bishops and monks. These schools imparted both
ecclesiastical doctrine and secular culture, forming them into one whole.
From these schools arose the universities, those glorious institutions of
the Middle Ages which, from their beginning, had the Church as their most
bountiful mother and patroness.

<p>Subsequently, when civil authorities, to promote the common good, began
and developed their own universities, the Church, loyal to her very
nature, did not desist from founding and favoring such kinds of centers
of learning and institutions of instruction. This is shown by the
considerable number of Catholic universities established in recent times
in nearly all parts of the world. Conscious of her worldwide salvific
mission, the Church wishes to be especially joined to these centers of
higher learning and she desires that they flourish everywhere and work
effectively to make Christ's true message present in the field of human
culture and to make it advance in that field.

<p>In order that Catholic universities might better achieve this goal, my
Predecessor Pope Pius XII sought to stimulate their united activity when,
by his Apostolic Brief of July 27, 1949, he formally established the
International Federation of Catholic Universities. It was "to include all
Athenaea which the Holy See either has canonically erected or will in the
future erect in the world, or will have explicitly recognized as
following the norms of Catholic teaching and as completely in conformity
with that teaching."[6]

<p>The Second Vatican Council, for this reason, did not hesitate to affirm
that "the Church devotes considerable care to schools of higher
learning," and it strongly recommended that Catholic universities should
"be established in suitable locations throughout the world" and that "the
students of these institutions should be truly outstanding in learning,
ready to shoulder duties of major responsibility in society and to
witness to the faith before the world."[7] As the Church well knows, "the
future of society and of the Church herself is closely bound up with the
development of young people engaged in higher studies."[8]

<p align=center><b>III.</b></p>

<p>It is not surprising, however, that among Catholic universities the
Church has always promoted with special care Ecclesiastical Faculties and
Universities, which is to say those concerned particularly with Christian
revelation and questions connected therewith and which are therefore more
closely connected with her mission of evangelization.

<p>In the first place, the Church has entrusted to these Faculties the task
of preparing with special care students for the priestly ministry, for
teaching the sacred sciences, and for the more arduous tasks of the
apostolate. It is also the task of these Faculties "to explore more
profoundly the various areas of the sacred disciplines so that day by day
a deeper understanding of sacred revelation will be developed, the
heritage of Christian wisdom handed down by our ancestors will be more
plainly brought into view, dialogue will be fostered with our separated
brothers and sisters and with non-Christians, and solutions will be found
for problems raised by doctrinal progress."[9]

<p>In fact, new sciences and new discoveries pose new problems that involve
the sacred disciplines and demand an answer. While carrying out their
primary duty of attaining through theological research a deeper grasp of
revealed truth, those engaged in the sacred sciences should therefore
maintain contact with scholars of other disciplines, whether these are
believers or not, and should try to evaluate and interpret the latters'
affirmations and judge them in the light of revealed truth.[10]

<p>From this assiduous contact with reality, theologians are also encouraged
to seek a more suitable way of communicating doctrine to their
contemporaries working in other various fields of knowledge, for "the
deposit of faith, or the truths contained in our venerable doctrine, is
one thing; quite another is the way in which these truths are formulated,
while preserving the same sense and meaning."[11] This will be very
useful so that among the People of God religious practice and uprightness
of soul may proceed at an equal pace with the progress of science and
technology, and so that, in pastoral work, the faithful may be gradually
led to a purer and more mature life of faith.

<p>The possibility of a connection with the mission of evangelization also
exists in Faculties of other sciences which, although lacking a special
link with Christian revelation, can still help considerably in the work
of evangelizing. These are looked at by the Church precisely under this
aspect when they are erected as Ecclesiastical Faculties. They therefore
have a particular relationship with the Church's Hierarchy.

<p>Thus, the Apostolic See, in carrying out its mission, is clearly aware of
its right and duty to erect and promote Ecclesiastical Faculties
dependent on itself, either with a separate existence or as parts of
universities, Faculties destined for the education of both ecclesiastical
and lay students. This See is very desirous that the whole People of God,
under the guidance of their Shepherds, should cooperate to ensure that
these centers of learning contribute effectively to the growth of the
faith and of Christian life.

<p>Ecclesiastical Faculties--which are ordered to the common good of the
Church and have a valuable relationship with the whole ecclesial
community--ought to be conscious of their importance in the Church and of
their participation in the ministry of the Church. Indeed, those
Faculties which treat of matters that are close to Christian revelation
should also be mindful of the orders which Christ, the Supreme Teacher,
gave to His Church regarding this ministry: "Go therefore and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have
commanded you" (Mt. 28:19-20).

<p>From this it follows that there must be in these Faculties that adherence
by which they are joined to the full doctrine of Christ, whose authentic
guardian and interpreter has always been through the ages the Magisterium
of the Church.

<p>Bishops' Conferences in the individual nations and regions where these
Faculties exist must diligently see to their care and progress, at the
same time that they ceaselessly promote their fidelity to the Church's
doctrine, so that these Faculties may bear witness before the whole
community of the faithful to their wholehearted following of the
above-mentioned command of Christ. This witness must always be borne both
by the Faculty as such and by each and every member of the Faculty.
Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties have been constituted in the
Church for the building up and perfecting of Christ's faithful, and they
must always bear this in mind as a criterion in the carrying out of their
work.

<p>Teachers are invested with very weighty responsibility in fulfilling a
special ministry of the word of God and in being instructors of the faith
for the young. Let them, above all, therefore be for their students, and
for the rest of the faithful, witnesses of the living truth of the Gospel
and examples of fidelity to the Church. It is fitting to recall the
serious words of Pope Paul VI: "The task of the theologian is carried out
with a view to building up ecclesial communion so that the People of God
may grow in the experience of faith."[12]

<p>To attain these purposes, Ecclesiastical Faculties should be organized in
such a way as to respond to the new demands of the present day. For this
reason, the Second Vatican Council stated that their laws should be
subjected to revision.[13]

<p>In fact, the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus, promulgated
by my Predecessor Pope Pius XI on May 24, 1931, did much in its time to
renew higher ecclesiastical studies. However, as a result of changed
circumstances, it now needs to be suitably adapted and altered.

<p>In the course of nearly fifty years great changes have taken place not
only in civil society but also in the Church herself. Important events,
especially the Second Vatican Council, have occurred, events which have
affected both the internal life of the Church and her external
relationships with Christians of other churches, with nonChristians, and
with non-believers, as well as with all those in favor of a more human
civilization.

<p>In addition, there is a steadily growing interest being shown in the
theological sciences, not only among the clergy but also by lay people,
who are attending theological schools in increasing numbers. These
schools have, as a consequence, greatly multiplied in recent times.

<p>Finally, a new attitude has arisen about the structure of universities
and Faculties, both civil and ecclesiastical. This is a result of the
justified desire for a university life open to greater participation, a
desire felt by all those in any way involved in university life.

<p>Nor can one ignore the great evolution that has taken place in
pedagogical and didactic methods, which call for new ways of organizing
studies. Then too there is the closer connection that is being felt more
and more between various sciences and disciplines, as well as the desire
for greater cooperation in the whole university environment.

<p>To meet these new demands, the Sacred Congregation for Catholic
Education, responding to the mandate received from the Council, already
in 1967 began to study the question of renewal along the lines indicated
by the Council. On May 20, 1968, it promulgated the Normae quaedam ad
Constitutionem Apostolicam "Deus Scientiarum Dominus" de studiis
academicis ecclesiasticis recognoscendam, which has exercised a
beneficial influence during recent years.

<p align=center><b>IV.</b></p>

<p>Now, however, this work needs to be completed and perfected with a new
law. This law, abrogating the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum
Dominus and the Norms of Application attached to it, as well as the
Normae quaedam published on May 20, 1968, by the Sacred Congregation for
Catholic Education, includes some still valid elements from these
documents, while laying down new norms whereby the renewal that has
already successfully begun can be developed and completed.

<p>Nobody is unaware of the difficulties that appear to impede the
promulgation of a new Apostolic Constitution. In the first place, there
is the "passage of time" which brings changes so rapidly that it seems
impossible to lay down anything stable and permanent. Then there is the
"diversity of places" which seems to call for a pluralism which would
make it appear almost impossible to issue common norms, valid for all
parts of the world.

<p>Since however there exist Ecclesiastical Faculties throughout the world,
which are erected and approved by the Holy See and which grant academic
degrees in its name, it is necessary that a certain substantial unity be
respected and that the requisites for gaining academic degrees be clearly
laid down and have universal value. Things which are necessary and which
are foreseen as being relatively stable must be set down by law, while at
the same time a proper freedom must be left for introducing into the
Statutes of the individual Faculties further specifications, taking into
account varying local conditions and the university customs obtaining in
each region. In this way, legitimate progress in academic studies is
neither hindered nor restricted, but rather is directed through right
channels towards obtaining better results. Moreover, together with the
legitimate differentiation of the Faculties, the unity of the Catholic
Church in these centers of education will also be clear to everyone.

<p>Therefore, the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, by command of
my Predecessor Pope Paul VI, has consulted, first of all, the
Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties themselves, then, the
departments of the Roman Curia and the other bodies interested. After
this, it established a commission of experts who, under the direction of
the same Congregation, have carefully reviewed the legislation covering
ecclesiastical academic studies.

<p>This work has now been successfully completed, and Pope Paul VI was about
to promulgate this Constitution, as he so ardently desired to do, when he
died; likewise Pope John Paul I was prevented by sudden death from doing
so. After long and careful consideration of the matter, I decree and lay
down, by my apostolic authority, the following laws and norms.

<p align=center><b>PART ONE
<br>GENERAL NORMS</b></p>

<p><b>Section I. Nature and Purpose of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties</b>

<p><i>Article 1.</i> To carry out the ministry of evangelization given to the
Church by Christ, the Church has the right and duty to erect and promote
Universities and Faculties which depend upon herself.

<p><i>Article 2.</i> In this Constitution the terms Ecclesiastical Universities and
Faculties mean those which have been canonically erected or approved by
the Apostolic See, which foster and teach sacred doctrine and the
sciences connected therewith, and which have the right to confer academic
degrees by the authority of the Holy See.

<p><i>Article 3.</i> The purpose of Ecclesiastical Faculties are:

<ol><li>through scientific research to cultivate and promote their own
disciplines, and especially to deepen
knowledge of Christian revelation and of matters connected with it, to
enunciate systematically the truths contained therein, to consider in the
light of revelation the most recent progress of the sciences, and to
present them to the people of the present day in a manner adapted to
various cultures:

<li>to train the students to a level of high qualification in their own
disciplines, according to Catholic
doctrine, to prepare them properly to face their tasks, and to promote
the continuing permanent education of the ministers of the Church;

<li>to collaborate intensely, in accordance with their own nature and in
close communion with the Hierarchy, with the
local and the universal Church, in the whole work of evangelization.</ol>

<i>Article 4.</i> It is the duty of Bishops' Conferences to follow carefully the
life and progress of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties, because
of their special ecclesial importance.

<p><i>Article 5.</i> The canonical erection or approval of Ecclesiastical
Universities and Faculties is reserved to the Sacred Congregation for
Catholic Education, which governs them according to law.[14]

<p><i>Article 6.</i> Only Universities and Faculties canonically erected or
approved by the Holy See and ordered according to the norms of this
present Constitution have the right to confer academic degrees which have
canonical value, with the exception of the special right of the
Pontifical Biblical Commission.[15]

<p><i>Article 7.</i> The Statutes of each University or Faculty, which must be
drawn up in accordance with the present Constitution, require approval by
the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education.

<p><i>Article 8.</i> Ecclesiastical Faculties erected or approved by the Holy See
in non-ecclesiastical universities, which confer both canonical and civil
academic degrees, must observe the prescriptions of the present
Constitution, account being taken of the conventions signed by the Holy
See with various nations or with the universities themselves.

<p><i>Article 9.</i>

<ol><li>Faculties which have not been canonically erected or
approved by the Holy See may not confer
academic degrees having canonical value.

<li>Academic degrees conferred by such Faculties, if they are to have value
for some canonical effects only,
require the recognition of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education.

<li>For this recognition to be given for individual degrees for a special
reason, the conditions laid down by the Sacred Congregation must be fulfilled.
</ol>

<i>Article 10.</i> For the correct carrying out of the present Constitution, the
Norms of application issued by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic
Education must be observed.

<p><b>Section II. The Academic Community and Its Government</b>

<p><i>Article 11.</i>
<ol>
<li>Since the University or Faculty forms a sort of community,
all the people in it, either as
individuals or as members of councils, must feel, each according to his
or her own status, co-responsible for the common good and must strive to
work for the institution's goals.

<li>Therefore, their rights and duties within the academic community must
be accurately set down in the
Statutes, to ensure that they are properly exercised within correctly
established limits.</ol>

<p><i>Article 12.</i> The Chancellor represents the Holy See to the University or
Faculty and equally the University or Faculty to the Holy See. He
promotes the continuation and progress of the University or Faculty and
he fosters its communion with the local and universal Church.

<p><i>Article 13.</i>
<ol><li>The Chancellor is the Prelate Ordinary on whom the
University or Faculty legally depends,
unless the Holy See established otherwise.

<li>Where conditions favor such a post, it is also possible to have a Vice-
Chancellor, whose authority is determined in the Statutes.</ol>

<i>Article 14.</i> If the Chancellor is someone other than the local Ordinary,
the statutory norms are to establish how the Ordinary and the Chancellor
carry out their respective offices in mutual accord.

<p><i>Article 15.</i>
The academic authorities are personal and collegial. Personal
authorities are, in the first place, the Rector or President and the
Dean. The collegial authorities are the various directive organisms or
councils of the University or Faculty.

<p><i>Article 16.</i> The Statutes of the University or Faculty must very carefully
set out the names and offices of the academic authorities, determining
the way they are designated and their term of office, taking into account
both the canonical nature of the individual University or Faculty and the
university practice in the local area.

<p><i>Article 17.</i> Those designated as academic authorities are to be people who
are truly knowledgeable about university life and, usually, who come from
among the teachers of some Faculty.

<p><i>Article 18.</i> The Rector and the President are named, or at least
confirmed, by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education.

<p><i>Article 19.</i> The Statutes determine how the personal and the collegial
authorities are to collaborate with each
other, so that, carefully observing the principle of collegiality,
especially in more serious matters and above all in those of an academic
nature, the persons in authority will enjoy that exercise of power which
really corresponds to their office.

This applies, in the first place, to the Rector, who has the duty to govern
the entire University and to
promote, in a suitable way, its unity, cooperation, and progress.

<p><i>Article 20.</i> <ol><li>When Faculties are parts of an Ecclesiastical University,
their governance must be coordinated
through the Statutes with the governance of the entire University in such
a way that the good of the single Faculties is assured, at the same time
that the good of the whole University is promoted and the cooperation of
all the Faculties with each other is favored.

<li>The canonical exigencies of Ecclesiastical Faculties must be
safeguarded even when such Faculties are
inserted into non-ecclesiastical universities.</ol>

<i>Article 21.</i> When a Faculty is joined to a seminary or college, the
Statutes, while always having due concern for cooperation in everything
pertaining to the students' good, must clearly and effectively provide
that the academic direction and administration of the Faculty is
correctly distinct from the governance and administration of the seminary
or college.

<p><b>Section III. Teachers</b>

<p><i>Article 22.</i> In each Faculty there must be a number of teachers,
especially permanent ones, which corresponds to the importance and
development of the individual disciplines as well as to the proper care
and profit of the students.

<p><i>Article 23.</i> There must be various ranks of teachers, determined in the
Statutes, according to their measure of preparation, their insertion into
the Faculty, their permanence, and their responsibility to the Faculty,
taking into account the university practice of the local area.

<p><i>Article 24.</i> The Statutes are to define which authorities are responsible
for hiring, naming, and promoting teachers, especially when it is a
question of giving them a permanent position.

<p><i>Article 25.</i>

<ol><li>Tbe legitimately hired as a permanent teacher in a Faculty,
a person must:

(1) be distinguished by wealth of knowledge, witness of life, and a sense
of responsibility;

(2) have a suitable doctorate or equivalent title or exceptional and
singular scientific accomplishment;

(3) show documentary proof of suitability for doing scientific research,
especially by a published dissertation;

(4) demonstrate teaching ability.

<li>These requirements for taking on permanent teachers must be applied
also, in proportionate measure, for hiring non-permanent ones.

<li>In hiring teachers, the scientific requirements in current force in the
university practice of the local area should be taken into account.</ol>

<i>Article 26.</i> <ol><li>All teachers of every rank must be marked by an upright
life, integrity of doctrine, and devotion to
duty, so that they can effectively contribute to the proper goals of an
Ecclesiastical Faculty.

<li>Those who teach matters touching on faith and morals are to be
conscious of their duty to carry out their
work in full communion with the authentic Magisterium of the Church,
above all, with that of the Roman Pontiff.[16]</ol>

<p><i>Article 27.</i>
<ol><li>Those who teach disciplines concerning faith or morals must
receive, after making their
profession of faith, a canonical mission from the Chancellor or his
delegate, for they do not teach on their own authority but by virtue of
the mission they have received from the Church. The other teachers must
receive permission to teach from the Chancellor or his delegate.

<li>All teachers, before they are given a permanent post or before they are
promoted to the highest category of
teacher, or else in both cases, as the Statutes are to state, must
receive a declaration of nihil obstat from the Holy See.</ol>

<i>Article 28.</i> Promotion to the higher ranks of teachers is to take place
only after a suitable interval of time and with due reference to teaching
skill to research accomplished, to the publication of scientific works,
to the spirit of cooperation in teaching and in research, and to
commitment to the Faculty.

<p><i>Article 29.</i> The teachers, in order to carry out their tasks
satisfactorily, must be free from other employment which cannot be
reconciled with their duty to do research and to instruct, according to
what the Statutes require for each rank of teacher.

<p><i>Article 30.</i> The Statutes must state:

(a) when and under which conditions a teaching post ends;

(b) for what reasons and in which ways a teacher can be suspended, or even
deprived of his post, so as to safeguard suitably the rights of the
teachers, of the Faculty or University, and, above all, of the students
and also of the ecclesial community.

<p><b>Section IV. Students</b>

<p><i>Article 31.</i> Ecclesiastical Faculties are open to all, whether
ecclesiastics or laity, who can legally give testimony to leading a moral
life and to having completed the previous studies appropriate to
enrolling in the Faculty.

<p><i>Article 32.</i> <ol><li>To enroll in a Faculty in order to obtain an academic
degree, one must present that kind of study
title which would be necessary to permit enrollment in a civil university
of one's own country or of the country where the Faculty is located.

<li>The Faculty, in its own Statutes,
should determine what, besides what is contained in No. 1 above, is needed
for entrance into its course of study,
including ancient and modern language requirements.</ol>

<i>Article 33.</i> Students must faithfully observe the laws of the Faculty
about the general program and about discipline--in the first place about
the study program, class attendance, and examinations--as well as all
that pertains to the life of the Faculty.

<p><i>Article 34.</i> The Statutes should define how the students, either
individually or collectively, take part in the university community life
in those aspects which can contribute to the common good of the Faculty
or University.

<p><i>Article 35.</i> The Statutes should equally determine how the students can
for serious reasons be suspended from certain rights or be deprived of
them or even be expelled from the Faculty, in such a way that the rights
of the student, of the Faculty or University, and also of the ecclesial
community are appropriately protected.

<p><b>Section V. Officials and Staff Assistants</b>

<p><i>Article 36.</i> <ol><li>In governing and administering a University or Faculty, the
authorities are to be assisted
by officials trained for various tasks.

<li>The officials are, first of all, the Secretary, the Librarian, and the
Financial Procurator.</ol>

<i>Article 37.</i> There should also be other staff assistants who have the task
of vigilance, order, and other duties, according to the needs of the
University or Faculty.

<p><b>Section VI. Study Program</b>

<p><i>Article 38.</i> <ol><li>In arranging the studies, the principles and norms which
for different matters are contained in
ecclesiastical documents, especially those of the Second Vatican Council,
must be carefully observed. At the same time account must be taken of
sound advances coming from scientific progress which can contribute to
answering the questions being currently asked.

<li>In the single Faculties let that
scientific method be used which corresponds to the needs of the
individual sciences. Up-to-date didactic and teaching methods should be
applied in an appropriate way, in order to bring about the personal
involvement of the students and their suitable, active participation in
their studies.</ol>

<i>Article 39.</i> <ol><li>Following the norm of the Second Vatican Council, according
to the nature of each Faculty:

(1) just freedom[17] should be acknowledged in research and teaching so
that true progress can be obtained in learning and understanding divine
truth;

(2) at the same time it is clear that:

(a) true freedom in teaching is necessarily contained within the limits of
God's Word, as this is constantly taught by the Church's Magisterium;

(b) likewise, true freedom in research is necessarily based upon firm
adherence to God's Word and deference to the Church's Magisterium, whose
duty it is to interpret authentically the Word of God.

<li>Therefore, in such a weighty matter one
must proceed with prudence, with trust, and without suspicion, at the
same time with judgment and without rashness, especially in teaching,
while working to harmonize studiously the necessities of science with the
pastoral needs of the People of God.</ol>

<i>Article 40.</i> In each Faculty the curriculum of studies is to be suitably
organized in steps or cycles, adapted to the material. These are usually
as follows:

(a) first, a general instruction is imparted, covering a coordinated
presentation of all the disciplines, along with an introduction into
scientific methodology;

(b) next, one section of the disciplines is studied more profoundly, at
the same time that the students practice scientific research more fully;

(c) finally, there is progress toward scientific maturity, especially
through a written work which truly makes a contribution to the advance of
the science.

<p><i>Article 41.</i> <ol><li>The disciplines which are absolutely necessary for the
Faculty to achieve its purposes should be
determined. Those also should be set out which in a different way are
helpful to these purposes and, therefore, how these are suitably
distinguished one from another.

<li>In each Faculty the disciplines should
be arranged in such a way that they form an organic body, so as to serve
the solid and coherent formation of the students and to facilitate
collaboration by the teachers.</ol>

<i>Article 42.</i> Lectures, especially in the basic cycle, must be given, and
the students must attend them, according to the norms to be determined in
the Statutes.

<p><i>Article 43.</i> Practical exercises and seminars, mainly in the
specialization cycle, must be assiduously carried on under the direction
of the teachers. These ought to be constantly complemented by private
study and frequent discussions with the teachers.

<p><i>Article 44.</i> The Statutes of the Faculty are to define which examinations
or which equivalent tests the students are to take, whether written or
oral, at the end of the semester, of the year, and especially of the
cycle, so that their ability can be verified in regard to continuing in
the Faculty and in regard to receiving academic degrees.

<p><i>Article 45.</i> Likewise the Statutes are to determine what value is to be
given for studies taken elsewhere, especially in regard to being
dispensed from some disciplines or examinations or even in regard to
reducing the curriculum, always, however, respecting the prescriptions of
the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education.

<p><b>Section VII. Academic Degrees</b>

<p><i>Article 46.</i> <ol><li>After each cycle of the curriculum of studies, the suitable
academic degree can be conferred,
which must be established for each Faculty, with attention given to the
duration of the cycle and to the disciplines taught in it.

<li>Therefore, according to the general and special norms of this
Constitution, all degrees conferred and the
conditions under which they are conferred are to be determined in the
Statutes of the individual Faculties.</ol>

<i>Article 47.</i> <ol><li>The academic degrees conferred by an Ecclesiastical Faculty
are: Baccalaureate, Licentiate, and Doctorate.

<li>Special qualifications can be added to the names of these degrees
according to the diversity of Faculties and
the order of studies in the individual Faculties.</ol>

<i>Article 48.</i> Academic degrees can be given different names in the Statutes
of the individual Faculties, taking account of the university practice in
the local area, indicating, however, with clarity the equivalence these
have with the names of the academic degrees above and maintaining
uniformity among the Ecclesiastical Faculties of the same area.

<p><i>Article 49.</i> <ol><li>Nobody can obtain an academic degree unless properly
enrolled in a Faculty, completing the
course of studies prescribed by the Statutes, and successfully passing
the examinations or tests.

<li>Nobody can be admitted to the doctorate unless first having obtained
the licentiate.

<li>A requisite for obtaining a doctorate, furthermore, is a doctoral
dissertation that makes a real contribution to
the progress of science, written under the direction of a teacher,
publicly defended and collegially approved; the principal part, at least,
must be published.</ol>

<i>Article 50.</i> <ol><li>The doctorate is the academic degree which enables one to
teach in a Faculty and which is
therefore required for this purpose; the licentiate is the academic
degree which enables one to teach in a major seminary or equivalent
school and which is therefore required for this purpose.

<li>The academic degrees which are required for filling various
ecclesiastical posts are to be stated by the
competent ecclesiastical authority.</ol>

<i>Article 51.</i> An honorary doctorate can be conferred for special scientific
merit or cultural accomplishment in promoting the ecclesiastical sciences.

<p><b>Section VIII. Matters Relating to Teaching</b>

<p><i>Article 52.</i> In order to achieve its proper purposes, especially in regard
to scientific research, each University or Faculty must have an adequate
library, in keeping with the needs of the staff and students. It must be
correctly organized and equipped with an appropriate catalogue.

<p><i>Article 53.</i> Through an annual allotment of money, the library must
continually acquire books, old and new, as well as the principal reviews,
so as to be able effectively to serve research, teaching of the
disciplines, instructional needs, and the practical exercises and
seminars.

<p><i>Article 54.</i> The library must be headed by a trained librarian, assisted
by a suitable council. The librarian participates opportunely in the
Council of the University or Faculty.

<p><i>Article 55.</i> <ol><li>The Faculty must also have technical equipment, audio-
visual materials, etc., to assist its didactic
work.

<li>In relationship to the special nature and purpose of a University or
Faculty, research institutions and
scientific laboratories should also be available, as well as other
apparatus needed for the accomplishment of its ends.</ol>

<p><b>Section IX. Economic Matters</b>

<p><i>Article 56.</i> A University or Faculty must have enough money to achieve
its purposes properly. Its financial endowments and its property rights
are to be carefully described.

<p><i>Article 57.</i> The Statutes are to determine the duty of the Financial
Procurator as well as the part the Rector or President and the University
or Faculty Council play in money matters, according to the norms of good
economics and so as to preserve healthy administration.

<p><i>Article 58.</i> Teachers, officials, and staff assistants are to be paid a
suitable remuneration, taking account of the customs of the local area,
and also taking into consideration social security and insurance
protection.

<p><i>Article 59.</i> Likewise, the Statutes are to determinate the general norms
that will indicate the ways the students are to contribute to the
expenses of the University or Faculty, by paying admission fees, yearly
tuition, examination fees, and diploma fees.

<p><b>Section X. Planning and Cooperation of Faculties</b>

<p><i>Article 60.</i> <ol><li>Great care must be given to the distribution, or as it is
called, the planning of Universities and
Faculties, so as to provide for their conservation, their progress, and
their suitable distribution in different parts of the world.

<li>To accomplish this end, the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education
is to be helped by advice from the
Bishops' Conferences and from a commission of experts.</ol>

<i>Article 61.</i> The erection or approval of a new University or Faculty is
decided upon by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education when all
the requirements are fulfilled. In this the Congregation listens to the
local Ordinaries, the Bishops' Conference, and experts, especially from
neighboring Faculties.

<p><i>Article 62.</i> <ol><li>Affiliation of some institution with a Faculty for the
purpose of being able to grant the
bachelor's degree is approved by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic
Education, after the conditions established by that same Sacred
Congregation are fulfilled.

<li>It is highly desirable that theological study centers, whether
diocesan or religious, be affiliated to a Faculty of Sacred Theology.</ol>

<i>Article 63.</i> Aggregation to a Faculty and incorporation into a Faculty by
an institution for the purposes of also granting higher academic degrees
is decided upon by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, after
the conditions established by that same Sacred Congregation are fulfilled.

<p><i>Article 64.</i> Cooperation between Faculties, whether of the same University
or of the same region or of a wider territorial area, is to be diligently
striven for. For this cooperation is of great help to the scientific
research of the teachers and to the better formation of the students. It
also fosters the advance of interdisciplinary collaboration, which
appears ever more necessary in current times, as well as contributing to
the development of complementarity among Faculties. It also helps to
bring about the penetration by Christian wisdom of all culture.

<p align=center><b>PART TWO
<br>SPECIAL NORMS</b></p>

<p><i>Article 65.</i> Besides the norms common to all Ecclesiastical Faculties,
which are established in the first part of this Constitution, special
norms are given hereunder for certain of those Faculties, because of
their particular nature and importance for the Church.

<p><b>Section I. Faculty of Sacred Theology</b>

<p><i>Article 66.</i> A Faculty of Sacred Theology has the aim of profoundly
studying and systematically explaining, according to the scientific
method proper to it, Catholic doctrine, derived with the greatest care
from divine revelation. It has the further aim of carefully seeking the
solution to human problems in the light of that same revelation.

<p><i>Article 67.</i> <ol><li>The study of Sacred Scripture is, as it were, the soul of
Sacred Theology, which rests upon
the written Word of God together with living Tradition, as its perpetual
foundation.[18]

<li>The individual theological disciplines are to be taught in such a way
that, from their internal structure and
from the proper object of each as well as from their connection with
other disciplines, including philosophical ones and the sciences of man,
the basic unity of theological instruction is quite clear, and in such a
way that all the disciplines converge in a profound understanding of the
mystery of Christ, so that this can be announced with greater
effectiveness to the People of God and to all nations.</ol>

<i>Article 68.</i> <ol><li>Revealed truth must be considered also in connection with
contemporary, evolving, scientific
accomplishments, so that it can be seen "how faith and reason give
harmonious witness to the unity of all truth."[19] Also, its exposition
is to be such that, without any change of the truth, there is adaptation
to the nature and character of every culture, taking special account of
the philosophy and the wisdom of various peoples. However, all syncretism
and every kind of false particularism are to be excluded.[20]

<li>The positive values in the various cultures and philosophies are to be
sought out, carefully examined, and
taken up. However, systems and methods incompatible with Christian faith
must not be accepted.</ol>

<p><i>Article 69.</i> Ecumenical questions are to be carefully treated, according
to the norms of competent Church authorities.[21] Also to be carefully
considered are relationships with non-Christian religions; and problems
arising from contemporary atheism are to be scrupulously studied.

<p><i>Article 70.</i> In studying and teaching the Catholic doctrine, fidelity to
the Magisterium of the Church is always to be emphasized. In the carrying
out of teaching duties, especially in the basic cycle, those things are,
above all, to be imparted which belong to the received patrimony of the
Church. Hypothetical or personal opinions which come from new research
are to be modestly presented as such.

<p><i>Article 71.</i> In presenting doctrine, those norms are to be followed which
are in the documents of the Second Vatican Council,[22] as well as those
found in more recent documents of the Holy See[23] insofar as these
pertain to academic studies.

<p><i>Article 72.</i> The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Sacred Theology
comprises:

a) the first cycle, fundamentals, which lasts for five years or ten
semesters, or else, when a previous two-year philosophy course is an
entrance requirement, for three years. Besides a solid philosophical
formation, which is a necessary propaedeutic for theological studies, the
theological disciplines must be taught in such a way that what is
presented is an organic exposition of the whole of Catholic doctrine,
together with an introduction to theological scientific methodology.

The cycle ends with the academic degree of Baccalaureate or some other
suitable degree as the Statutes of the Faculty determine.

b) the second cycle, specialization, which lasts for two years or four
semesters. In this cycle the special disciplines are taught corresponding
to the nature of the diverse specializations being undertaken. Also
seminars and practical exercises are conducted for the acquisition of the
ability to do scientific research.

The cycle concludes with the academic degree of a specialized Licentiate.

c) the third cycle, in which for a suitable period of time scientific
formation is brought to completion, especially through the writing of a
doctrinal dissertation.

The cycle concludes with the academic degree of Doctorate.

<p><i>Article 73.</i> <ol><li>To enroll in a Faculty of Sacred Theology, the student
must have done the previous studies called
for in accordance with article 32 of this Constitution.

<li>Where the first cycle of the Faculty lasts for only three years, the
student must submit proof of having
properly completed a two-year course in philosophy at a Faculty of
Philosophy or at an approved institution.</ol>

<i>Article 74.</i> <ol><li>A Faculty of Sacred Theology has the special duty of
taking care of the scientific
theological formation of those preparing for the priesthood or preparing
to hold some ecclesiastical office.

<li>For this purpose, special courses suitable for seminarians should be
offered. It is also appropriate for
the Faculty itself to offer the "pastoral year" required for the
priesthood, in addition to the five-year basic cycle. At the end of this
year, a special Diploma may be conferred.</ol>

<p><b>Section II. Faculty of Canon Law</b>

<p><i>Article 75.</i> A Faculty of Canon Law, whether Latin or Oriental, has the
aim of cultivating and promoting the juridical disciplines in the light
of the law of the Gospel and of deeply instructing the students in these,
so as to form researchers, teachers, and others who will be trained to
hold special ecclesiastical posts.

<p><i>Article 76.</i> The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Canon Law comprises:

(a) the first cycle, lasting at least one year or two semesters, in which
are studied the general fundamentals of Canon Law and those disciplines
which are required for higher juridical formation;

(b) the second cycle, lasting two years or four semesters, during which
the entire Code of Canon Law is studied in depth, along with other
disciplines having an affinity with it;

(c) the third cycle, lasting at least a year or two semesters, in which
juridical formation is completed and a doctoral dissertation is written.

<p><i>Article 77.</i> <ol><li>With regard to the studies prescribed for the first cycle,
the Faculty may make use of the studies
done in another Faculty and which it can acknowledge as responding to its
needs.

<li>The second cycle concludes with the Licentiate and the third with the
Doctorate.

<li>The Statutes of the Faculty are to define the special requirements for
the conferring of the academic
degrees, observing the Norms of Application of the Sacred Congregation
for Catholic Education.</ol>

<p><i>Article 78.</i> To enroll in a Faculty of Canon Law, the student must have
done the previous studies called for in accordance with Article 32 of
this Constitution.

<p><b>Section III. Faculty of Philosophy</b>

<p><i>Article 79.</i> <ol><li>An Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy has the aim of
investigating philosophical problems
according to scientific methodology, basing itself on a heritage of
perennially valid philosophy.[24] It has to search for solutions in the
light of natural reason and, furthermore, it has to demonstrate their
consistency with the Christian view of the world, of man, and of God,
placing in a proper light the relationship between philosophy and theology.

<li>Then, the students are to be instructed so as to make them ready to
teach and to fill other suitable intellectual
posts as well as to prepare them to promote Christian culture and to
undertake a fruitful dialogue with the people of our time.</ol>

<i>Article 80.</i> In the teaching of philosophy, the relevant norms should be
observed which are contained in the documents of the Second Vatican
Council[25] and in other recent documents of the Holy See concerning
academic studies.[26]

<p><i>Article 81.</i> The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Philosophy
comprises:

(a) the first cycle, basics, in which for two years or four semesters an
organic exposition of the various parts of philosophy is imparted, which
includes treating the world, man, and God. It also includes the history
of philosophy, together with an introduction into the method of
scientific research;

(b) the second cycle, the beginning of specialization, in which for two
years or four semesters through special disciplines and seminars a more
profound consideration is imparted in some sector of philosophy;

(c) the third cycle, in which for a suitable period of time philosophical
maturity is promoted, especially by means of writing a doctoral
dissertation.

<p><i>Article 82.</i> The first cycle ends with the degree of Baccalaureate, the
second with the specialized Licentiate, and the third with the Doctorate.

<p><i>Article 83.</i> To enroll in a Faculty of Philosophy, the student must have
done the previous studies called for in accordance with Article 32 of the
Constitution.

<p><b>Section IV Other Faculties</b>

<p><i>Article 84.</i> Besides the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon Law, and
Philosophy, other Faculties have been or can be canonically erected,
according to the needs of the Church and with a view to attaining certain
goals, as for instance:

(a) a more profound study of certain sciences which are of greater
importance to the theological, juridical, and philosophical disciplines;

(b) the promotion of other sciences, first of all the humanities, which
have a close connection with the theological disciplines or with the work
of evangelization;

(c) the cultivation of letters which provide a special help either to a
better understanding of Christian revelation or else in carrying on the
work of evangelizing;

(d) finally, the more exacting preparation both of the clergy and laity
for properly carrying out specialized apostolic tasks.

<p><i>Article 85.</i> In order to achieve the goals set down in the preceding
article, the following Faculties or institutions "ad instar Facultatis"
have already been erected and authorized to grant degrees by the Holy See
itself:

<ul><li>Christian archaeology,

<li>Biblical studies and ancient Eastern studies,

<li>Church history,

<li>Christian and classical literature,

<li>Liturgy,

<li>Missiology,

<li>Sacred Music,

<li>Psychology,

<li>Educational science or Pedagogy,

<li>Religious science,

<li>Social sciences,

<li>Arabic studies and Islamology,

<li>Medi&aelig;val studies,

<li>Oriental Ecclesiastical studies,

<li>"Utriusque Iuris" (both canon and civil law).</ul>

<p><i>Article 86.</i> It belongs to
the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education to set out, in accordance
with circumstances, special norms for these Faculties, just as has been
done in the above sections for the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon
Law, and Philosophy.

<p><i>Article 87.</i> The Faculties and Institutes for which special norms have not
yet been set out must also draw up their own Statutes. These must conform
to the General Norms established in the first part of this Constitution,
and they must take into account the special nature and purpose proper to
each of these Faculties or Institutes.

<p><b>Transitional Norms</b>

<p><i>Article 88.</i> This present Constitution comes into effect on the first day
of the 1980-1981 academic year or of the 1981 academic year, according to
the scholastic calendar in use in various places.

<p><i>Article 89.</i> Each University or Faculty must, before January 1, 1981,
present its proper Statutes, revised according to this Constitution, to
the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education. If this is not done, its
power to give academic degrees is, by this very fact, suspended.

<p><i>Article 90.</i> In each Faculty the studies must be arranged so that the
students can acquire academic degrees according to the norms of this
Constitution, immediately upon this Constitution coming into effect,
preserving the students' previously acquired rights.

<p><i>Article 91.</i> The Statutes are to be approved experimentally for three
years so that, when this period is completed, they may be perfected and
approved definitively.

<p><i>Article 92.</i> Those Faculties which have a juridical connection with civil
authorities may be given a longer period of time to revise their
Statutes, providing that this is approved by the Sacred Congregation for
Catholic Education.

<p><i>Article 93.</i> It is the task of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic
Education, when, with the passage of time, circumstances shall require
it, to propose changes to be introduced into this Constitution, so that
this same Constitution may be continuously adapted to the needs of
Ecclesiastical Faculties.

<p><i>Article 94.</i> All laws and customs presently obtaining which are in
contradiction to this Constitution are abrogated, whether these are
universal or local, even if they are worthy of special or individual
mention. Likewise completely abrogated are all privileges hitherto
granted by the Holy See to any person, whether physical or moral, if
these are contrary to the prescriptions of this Constitution.

<p>It is my will, finally, that this my Constitution be established, be
valid, and be efficacious always and everywhere, fully and integrally in
all its effects, that it be religiously observed by all to whom it
pertains, anything to the contrary notwithstanding. If anyone, knowingly
or unknowingly, acts otherwise than I have decreed, I order that this
action is to be considered null and void.

<p>Given at St. Peter's in Rome, the fifteenth day of April, the Solemnity
of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the year 1979, the first
of my Pontificate.
