<h1>Signum Magnum</h1>  
<p><b>Letter on the Blessed Virgin Mary
<br>His Holiness Pope Paul VI
<br>Promulgated on May 13, 1967</b>

<p><i>To the Catholic bishops of the world.</i>

<p>Venerable brothers, health and apostolic blessings.

<p>THE GREAT SIGN which the Apostle John saw in heaven, "a woman
clothed with the sun," [1] is interpreted by the sacred Liturgy, [2] not
without foundation, as referring to the most blessed Mary, the mother
of all men by the grace of Christ the Redeemer.

<p>The memory, venerable brothers, is still vivid in our mind of the
great emotion we felt in proclaiming the august Mother of God as the
spiritual Mother of the Church, that is to say, of all the faithful
and of the sacred pastors, as the crowning of the third session of the
Second Vatican Council, after having solemnly promulgated the Dogmatic
Constitution on the Church. [3] Great also was the happiness of
numerous Council Fathers, as well as of the faithful, who were present
at the sacred rite in St. Peter's basilica and of the entire Christian
people scattered throughout the world.

<p>The memory came spontaneously to many minds of the first grandiose
triumph achieved by the humble "handmaid of the Lord" [4] when the
Fathers from East and West, gathered in an ecumenical council at
Ephesus in the year 431 greeted Mary as "Theotokos" -- genitrix of God.
The Christian population of the illustrious city associated themselves
with a jubilant impulse of faith with the exultance of the Fathers and
accompanied them with torchlights to their dwellings.

<p>Oh! with how much maternal satisfaction the Virgin Mary must have
looked on the pastors and the faithful in that glorious hour of the
history of the Church, recognizing in the hymns of praise, raised in
honor principally of the Son and then in her own, the echo of the
prophetic canticle which she herself on the impulse of the Holy Spirit
had raised to the Most High:

<blockquote>
"My soul magnifies the Lord,
<br>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
<br>because He has regarded the lowliness of His handmaid;
<br>for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed;
<br>because He who is mighty has done great things for me
<br>and holy is His name." [5]
</blockquote>

On the occasion of the religious ceremonies which are taking place
at this time in honor of the Virgin Mother of God in Fatima, Portugal,
where she is venerated by countless numbers of the faithful for her
motherly and compassionate heart, [6] we wish to call the attention of
all sons of the Church once more to the indissoluble link between the
spiritual motherhood of Mary, so amply illustrated in the (council's)
Dogmatic Constitution on the Church [7] and the duties of redeemed men
toward her, the Mother of the Church.

<p>Once it is acknowledged, by virtue of the numerous testimonies
offered by the sacred texts and by the holy Fathers and remembered in
the constitution mentioned above, that "Mary, the Mother of God and
Mother of the Redeemer" [8] has been "united to Him by a close and
indissoluble tie" [9] and that she has a most singular role in "the
mystery of the Incarnate Word and of the Mystical Body," [10] that is
to say, in "the economy of salvation," [11] it appears evident that the
Virgin is "rightly honored by the Church with a special
veneration, [12] particularly liturgical," [13] not only as "the most
holy Mother of God, who took part in the mysteries of Christ," [14] but
also "as the Mother of the Church." [15]

<p>Nor is it to be feared that liturgical reform, if put into
practice according to the formula "the law of faith must establish the
law of prayer" [16] may be detrimental to the "wholly singular"
veneration [17] due to the Virgin Mary for her prerogatives, first
among these being the dignity of the Mother of God. Nor is it to be
feared that the greater veneration, liturgical as well as private,
given to her may obscure or diminish "the adoration which is offered
to the Incarnate Word, as well as to the Father and to the Holy
Spirit." [18]

<p>Accordingly, without wishing to restate here, venerable brothers,
the traditional doctrine of the Church regarding the function of the
Mother of God on the plane of salvation and her relations with the
Church, we believe that, if we dwell on the consideration of two
truths which are very important for the renewal of Christian life, we
would be doing something of great utility for the souls of the
faithful.

<p align=center><b>PART I</b></p>

<p>The first truth is this: Mary is the Mother of the Church not
only because she is the Mother of Christ and His most intimate
associate in "the new economy when the Son of God took a human nature
from her, that He might in the mysteries of His flesh free man from
sin," [19] but also because "she shines forth to the whole community of
the elect as a model of the virtues." [20] Indeed, just as no human
mother can limit her task to the generation of a new man but must
extend it to the function of nourishing and educating her offspring,
thus the blessed Virgin Mary, after participating in the redeeming
sacrifice of the Son, and in such an intimate way as to deserve to be
proclaimed by Him the Mother not only of His disciple John but -- may we
be allowed to affirm it -- of mankind which he in some way
represents, [21] now continues to fulfill from heaven her maternal
function as the cooperator in the birth and development of divine life
in the individual souls of redeemed men. This is a most consoling
truth which, by the free consent of God the All-Wise, is an
integrating part of the mystery of human salvation; therefore it must
be held as faith by all Christians.

<p>But in what way does Mary cooperate in the growth of the members
of the Mystical Body in the life of grace? First of all, by her
unceasing prayers inspired by a most ardent charity. The Holy Virgin,
in fact, though rejoicing in the vision of the august Trinity, does
not forget her Son's advancing, as she herself did in the "pilgrimage
of the faith". [22] Indeed, contemplating them in God and clearly
seeing their necessities, in communion with Jesus Christ, "who
continues forever and is therefore able at all times to intercede for
them," [23] she makes herself their Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix and
Mediatrix. [24] Of this intercession of hers for the People of God
with the Son, the Church has been persuaded, ever since the first
centuries, as testified to by this most ancient antiphon which, with
some slight difference, forms part of the liturgical prayer in the
East as well as in the West: "We seek refuge under the protection of
your mercies, oh Mother of God; do not reject our supplication in need
but save us from perdition, O you who alone are blessed." [25] Nor
should anyone believe that the maternal intervention of Mary would
prejudice the predominant and irreplaceable efficacy of Christ, our
Savior. On the contrary, it draws its strength from the mediation of
Christ of which it is the luminous proof. [26]

<p>But the cooperation of the Mother of the Church in the development
of the divine life of the souls does not come to an end with the
appeal to the Son. She exercises on redeemed men another influence:
that of example. An influence which is indeed most important,
according to the well-known axiom: "Verba movent, exempla trahunt"
(Words move, examples attract). In fact, just as the teachings of the
parents become far more efficacious if they are strengthened by the
example of a life conforming with the norms of human and Christian
prudence, so the sweetness and the enchantment emanating from the
sublime virtues of the immaculate Mother of God attract souls in an
irresistible way to imitation of the divine model, Jesus Christ, of
whom she was the most faithful image. Therefore the council declared:
"The Church, devotedly meditating on her and contemplating her in the
light of the Word made man, enters more intimately into the supreme
mystery of the Incarnation and becomes ever increasingly like her
Spouse" [27].

<p>Furthermore, it is well to bear in mind that Mary's eminent
sanctity was not only a singular gift of divine liberality. It was
also the fruit of the continuous and generous cooperation of her free
will in the inner motions of the Holy Spirit. It is because of the
perfect harmony between divine grace and the activity of her human
nature that the Virgin rendered supreme glory to the Most Holy Trinity
and became the illustrious ornament of the Church, which thus greets
her in sacred Liturgy: "You are the glory of Jerusalem, the joy of
Israel, the honor of our people" [28].

<p>Let us then admire in the pages of the Gospel the testimonies of
such sublime harmony. Mary, as soon as she was reassured by the voice
of the Angel Gabriel that God had chosen her as the unblemished mother
of His only-begotten Son, unhesitatingly gave her consent to a work
which would have engaged all the energies of her fragile nature and
declared: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me
according to thy word" [29]. From that moment, she consecrated all of
herself to the service not only of the heavenly Father and of the Word
Incarnate, who had become her Son, but also to all mankind, having
clearly understood that Jesus, in addition to saving his people from
the slavery of sin, would become the King of a messianic Kingdom,
universal and eternal [30].

<p>Therefore, the life of Joseph's pure spouse, who remained a virgin
"during childbirth and after childbirth" -- as the Catholic Church has
always believed and professed [31] and as was fitting for her who was
raised to the incomparable dignity of divine motherhood [32] -- was a
life of such perfect union with the Son that she shared in His joys,
sorrows and triumphs. And even after Christ had ascended to heaven
she remained united to Him by a most ardent love while she faithfully
fulfilled the new mission of spiritual Mother of the most beloved of
the disciples and of the nascent Church. It can be asserted that the
whole life of the humble handmaid of the Lord, from the moment when
she was greeted by the Angel, until her assumption in body and soul to
heavenly glory, was a life of loving service.

<p>We, therefore, associating ourselves with the Evangelists, with
the Fathers and the Doctors of the Church, recalled in the dogmatic
constitution "Lumen gentium" (Chap. VIII), full of admiration,
contemplate Mary, firm in her faith, ready in her obedience, simple in
humility, exulting in praising the Lord, ardent in charity, strong and
constant in the fulfillment of her mission to the point of sacrificing
herself, in full communion of sentiments with her Son who immolated
Himself on the Cross to give men a new life.

<p>Before such splendor of virtue, the first duty of all those who
recognize in the Mother of Christ the model of the Church, is to unite
themselves to her in giving thanks to the Most High for working great
things in Mary for the benefit of all mankind. But this is not
enough. It is also the duty of all the faithful to pay as tribute to
the most faithful handmaid of the Lord, a veneration of praise, of
gratitude and of love because, by a wise and mild divine provision,
her free consent and her generous cooperation in the designs of God
had, and still have, a great influence in the attainment of human
salvation [33]. Therefore every Christian must make St. Anselm's
prayer his own: "Oh, glorious Lady, grant that through you we may
deserve to ascend to Jesus, your Son, who through you deigned to
descend among us" [34].

<p align=center><b>PART II:
<br>DEVOUT IMITATION OF THE VIRTUES OF THE MOST HOLY MARY</b></p>

<p>Neither the grace of the divine Redeemer, nor the powerful
intercession of His Mother and our spiritual Mother, nor yet her
sublime sanctity, could lead us to the port of salvation if we did not
respond to them by our persevering will to honor Jesus Christ and the
Holy Virgin with our devout imitation of their sublime virtue.

<p>It is therefore the duty of all Christians to imitate in a
reverent spirit the examples of goodness left to them by their
heavenly Mother. This, venerable brothers, is the other truth to
which we are pleased to call your attention and the attention of the
faithful entrusted to your pastoral care, that they may second with
docility the exhortation of the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council:
"Let the faithful remember that true devotion consists neither in
fruitless and passing emotion, nor in a certain vain credulity.
Rather, it proceeds from true faith, by which we are led to know the
excellence of the Mother of God, and are moved to a filial love toward
our mother and to the imitation of her virtues." [35]

<p>Imitation of Jesus Christ is undoubtedly the regal way to be
followed to attain sanctity and reproduce in ourselves, according to
our forces, the absolute perfection of the heavenly Father. But while
the Catholic Church has always proclaimed a truth so sacrosanct, it
has also affirmed that imitation of the Virgin Mary, far from
distracting the souls from the faithful following of Christ, makes it
more pleasant and easier for them. For, since she had always done the
will of God, she was the first to deserve the praise which Christ
addressed to His disciples: "Whoever does the will of my Father in
heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother." [36]

<p>The general norm "Through Mary to Jesus" is therefore valid also
for the imitation of Christ. Nevertheless, let our faith not be
perturbed, as if the intervention of a creature in every way similar
to us, except as regards sin, offended our personal dignity and
prevented the intimacy and immediacy of our relationships of adoration
and friendship with the Son of God. Let us rather recognize the
"goodness and the love of God the Savior," [37] who, condescending to
our misery, so remote from His infinite sanctity, wished to make it
easier for us to imitate it by giving us as a model the human person
of His Mother. She, in fact, among the human beings, offered the most
shining example and the closest to us, of that perfect obedience
whereby we lovingly and readily conform with the will of the eternal
Father. Christ Himself, as we well know, made this full closeness to
the approval of the Father, the supreme ideal of His human behavior,
declaring: "I do always the things that are pleasing to Him." [38]

<p>If we then contemplate the Virgin of Nazareth in the halo of her
prerogative and of her virtues, we will see her shine before our eyes
as the "New Eve," [39] the exalted daughter of Sion, the summit of the
Old Testament and the dawn of the New, in which "the fullness of
time" [40] was realized, which was preordained by God for the mission
in the world of His only-begotten Son. In truth, the Virgin Mary,
more than all the patriarchs and prophets, more than the "just" and
"pious" Simeon awaited and implored "the consolation of Israel ... the
Christ of the Lord" [41] and then greeted His advent with the hymn of
"Magnificat" when He descended into her most chaste womb to take on
our flesh.

<p>It is in Mary, therefore, that the Church of Christ indicates the
example of the worthiest way of receiving in our spirits the Word of
God, in accordance with the luminous sentence of St. Augustine: "Mary
was therefore more blessed in receiving the faith in Christ than in
conceiving the flesh of Christ. Accordingly, maternal consanguinity
would not have benefited Mary if she had not felt more fortunate in
having Christ in her heart than in her womb." [42] And it is still in
her that Christians can admire the example of how to fulfill, with
humility and at the same time with magnanimity, the mission which God
entrusts to each one in this world, in relation to his own salvation
and that of his fellow beings.

<p>"Therefore, I beg you, be imitators of me as I am of Christ." [43]
These words, and with greater reason than the Apostle Paul to the
Christians of Corinth, can be addressed by the Mother of the Church to
the multitudes of the faithful, who, in a symphony of faith and love
with the generations of past centuries, acclaim her as blessed. [44]
It is an invitation which it is a duty to heed docilely.

<p>And then a message of supreme utility seems today to reach the
faithful from her who is the Immaculate, the holy, the cooperator of
the Son in the work of restoration of supernatural life in souls. [45]
In fact, in devoutly contemplating Mary they draw from her a stimulus
for trusting prayer, a spur to the practice of penance and to the holy
fear of God. Likewise, it is in this Marian elevation that they more
often hear echoing the words with which Jesus Christ announced the
advent of the Kingdom of heaven: "Repent and believe in the
Gospel" [46]; and His severe admonition: "Unless you repent you will
all perish in the same manner." [47]

<p>Therefore, impelled by love and by the wish to placate God for the
offenses against His sanctity and His justice and, at the same time,
moved by trust in His infinite mercy, we must bear the sufferings of
the spirit and of the body that we may expiate our sins and those of
our fellow beings and so avoid the twofold penalty of "harm" and of
"sense," that is to say, the loss of God -- the supreme good -- and
eternal fire. [48]

<p>What must stimulate the faithful even more to follow the examples
of the most holy Virgin is the fact that Jesus Himself, by giving her
to us as our Mother, has tacitly indicated her as the model to be
followed. It is, in fact, a natural thing that the children should
have the same sentiments of their mothers and should reflect their
merits and virtues. Therefore, as each one of us can repeat with St.
Paul: "The Son of God loved me and gave Himself up for me," [49] so in
all trust he can believe that the divine Savior has left to him also,
in spiritual heritage, His Mother, with all the treasures of grace and
virtues with which He had endowed her, that she may pour them over us
through the influence of her powerful intercession and our willing
imitation. This is why St. Bernard rightly affirms: "Coming to her
the Holy Spirit filled her with grace for herself; when the same
Spirit pervaded her again she became superabundant and redounding in
grace for us also." [50]

<p>From what we have been illustrating in the light of the holy
Gospel and of the Catholic tradition, it appears evident that the
spiritual motherhood of Mary transcends space and time and belongs to
the universal history of the Church, since she has always been present
in the Church with her maternal assistance. Likewise the meaning of
the affirmation appears clear, which is so often repeated: our era
may well be called the Marian era. In fact, if it is true that, by an
exalted grace of the Lord, the providential role of the most holy Mary
in the history of salvation has been more deeply understood by the
vast strata of the Christian people, this, however, should not lead us
to believe that in past ages we had no intuition whatever of this
truth or that future ones will ignore it. In truth, all periods of
the Church's history have benefited and will benefit from the maternal
presence of the Mother of God because she will remain always
indissolubly joined to the mystery of the Mystical Body, of whose Head
it was written: "Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday and today, yes,
and forever." [51]

<p>Venerable brothers, the persuasion that the thought of the Church
regarding the veneration of praise, gratitude and love due to the most
blessed Virgin is in full accord with the doctrine of the holy Gospel,
as it was more precisely understood and explained by the tradition of
the East as well as of the West, stirs in our spirit the hope that
this pastoral exhortation of ours for an ever more fervid and more
fruitful Marian piety will be received with generous acceptance not
only by the faithful entrusted to your care, but also by those who,
while not enjoying full communion with the Catholic Church,
nevertheless, together with us, admire and venerate the handmaid of
the Lord, the Virgin Mary, Mother of the Son of God.

<p>May the Immaculate Heart of Mary shine before the eyes of all
Christians as the model of perfect love toward God and toward our
fellow beings; may it lead them toward the Holy Sacraments by virtue
of which souls are cleansed from the stains of sin and are preserved
from it. May it also stimulate them to make reparation for the
innumerable offenses against the Divine Majesty. Lastly, may it shine
like a banner of unity and a spur to perfect the bonds of brotherhood
among all Christians in the bosom of the one Church of Jesus Christ,
which "taught by the Holy Spirit, honors her with filial affection and
piety as a most beloved mother." [52]

<p>Since the 25th anniversary is recalled this year of the solemn
consecration of the Church and of mankind to Mary, the Mother of God,
and to her Immaculate Heart, by our predecessor of venerated memory,
Pius XII, on Oct. 31, 1942 on the occasion of the broadcast message to
the Portuguese nation [53] -- a consecration which we ourself have
renewed on Nov. 21, 1964 [54] -- we exhort all the sons of the Church to
renew personally their consecration to the Immaculate Heart of the
Mother of the Church and to bring alive this most noble act of
veneration through a life ever more consonant with the divine will [55]
and in a spirit of filial service and of devout imitation of their
heavenly Queen.

<p>Lastly, venerable brothers, we express the trust that, thanks to
your encouragement, the clergy and the Christian people entrusted to
your pastoral ministry will respond in a generous spirit to this
exhortation of ours so as to demonstrate toward the Virgin Mother of
God a more ardent piety and a firmer confidence. Meanwhile while we
are comforted by the certainty that the glorious Queen of Heaven and
our most sweet Mother will never cease to assist all and each one of
her sons and will never withdraw from the entire Church of Christ her
heavenly patronage, to you yourselves and to your faithful, as a
pledge of divine favors and as a sign of our benevolence, we
wholeheartedly impart the apostolic blessing.

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter, on the 13th day of the month of May
in the year 1967, the fourth of our pontificate.
