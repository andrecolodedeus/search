<h1>Singulari Quadam</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on Labor Organizations
<br>His Holiness Pope Pius X
<br>September 24, 1912</b>

<p><i>To Our Beloved Son, George Kopp, Cardinal Priest of the Holy Roman Church, Bishop of Breslau, and to the other Archbishops and Bishops of Germany.</i>

<p>Beloved Son and Venerable Brethren, Health and the Apostolic Blessing.

<p>WE ARE MOVED by particularly affectionate and benevolent sentiments toward
the Catholics of Germany, who are most loyally and obediently devoted to
the Apostolic See and accustomed to battle generously and courageously on
behalf of the Church. We therefore feel compelled, Venerable Brethren, to
devote Our full strength and attention to the discussion of that issue
which has arisen among them about workingmen's associations. Concerning
this problem several of you, as well as qualified and respected
representatives of both viewpoints, have already informed Us repeatedly
during the past few years. Conscious of Our Apostolic Office, We have
studied this problem most diligently. We fully realize that Our sacred duty
is to labor unceasingly that Our beloved sons may preserve the Catholic
teaching unadulterated and unimpaired, in no way allowing their Faith to be
endangered.

<p>If they are not in time urged to be on guard, they would obviously,
gradually and inadvertently, fall into the danger of being satisfied with a
vague and indefinite form of the Christian religion which has lately been
designated as intercredal. This amounts to nothing more than an empty
recommendation of a generalized Christianity. Obviously, nothing is more
contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Moreover, since Our most ardent
desire is the promotion and fortification of concord among Catholics, We
constantly try to remove all those occasions of quarrels which dissipate
the strength of men of good will and are advantageous only for the enemies
of religion. Finally, We desire and intend that the faithful live with
their non-Catholic fellow citizens in that peace without which neither the
order of human society nor the welfare of the State can endure.

<p>If, however, as We have already said, the existence of this question was
known to Us, We nevertheless thought it wise to obtain each of your
opinions, Venerable Brethren, before announcing Our decision. You have
answered Our questions with that conscientiousness and diligence which the
seriousness of the question demands.

<p>2. Accordingly, We first of all declare that all Catholics have a sacred
and inviolable duty, both in private and public life, to obey and firmly
adhere to and fearlessly profess the principles of Christian truth
enunciated by the teaching office of the Catholic Church. In particular We
mean those principles which Our Predecessor has most wisely laid down in
the encyclical letter "Rerum Novarum." We know that the Bishops of Prussia
followed these most faithfully in their deliberations at the Fulda Congress
of 1900. You yourselves have summarized the fundamental ideas of these
principles in your communications regarding this question.

<p>3. These are fundamental principles: No matter what the Christian does,
even in the realm of temporal goods, he cannot ignore the supernatural
good. Rather, according to the dictates of Christian philosophy, he must
order all things to the ultimate end, namely, the Highest Good. All his
actions, insofar as they are morally either good or bad (that is to say,
whether they agree or disagree with the natural and divine law), are
subject to the judgment and judicial office of the Church. All who glory in
the name of Christian, either individually or collectively, if they wish to
remain true to their vocation, may not foster enmities and dissensions
between the classes of civil society. On the contrary, they must promote
mutual concord and charity. The social question and its associated
controversies, such as the nature and duration of labor, the wages to be
paid, and workingmen's strikes, are not simply economic in character.
Therefore they cannot be numbered among those which can be settled apart
from ecclesiastical authority. "The precise opposite is the truth. It is
first of all moral and religious, and for that reason its solution is to be
expected mainly from the moral law and the pronouncements of religion."
[Encyclical letter of Leo XIII, "Graves de communi," January 18, 1901.]

<p>4. Now, concerning workingmen's associations, even though their purpose is
to obtain earthly advantages for their members, nonetheless those
associations are to be most approved and considered as most useful for the
genuine and permanent advantage of their members which are established
chiefly on the foundation of the Catholic religion and openly follow the
directives of the Church. We have repeated this declaration on several
previous occasions in answer to question from various countries.
Consequently, such so-called confessional Catholic associations must
certainly be established and promoted in every way in Catholic regions as
well as in all other districts where it can be presumed that they can
sufficiently assist the various needs of their members. However, when there
is a question about associations which directly or indirectly touch upon
the sphere of religion and morality, it would not be permitted to foster
and spread mixed organizations, that is, associations composed of Catholics
and non-Catholics, in the areas just mentioned. Over and above other
matters, in such organizations there are or certainly can be for our people
serious dangers to the integrity of their faith and the due obedience to
the commandments and precepts of the Catholic Church. Venerable Brethren,
you yourselves have also openly called attention to this question in
several of your answers which We have read.

<p>5. We therefore lavish praise upon each and every one of the strictly
Catholic workingmen's associations existing in Germany. We wish them every
success in all their endeavors on behalf of the laboring people, hoping
they will enjoy a constant increase. However, in saying this We do not deny
that Catholics, in their efforts to improve the workers' living conditions,
more equitable distribution of wages, and other justified advantages, have
a right, provided they exercise due caution, to collaborate with non-
Catholics for the common good. For such a purpose, however, We would rather
see Catholic and non-Catholic associations unite their forces through that
new and timely institution known as the cartel.

<p>6. Not a few of you, Venerable Brethren, have asked Us whether it is
permissible to tolerate the so-called Christian Trade Unions that now exist
in your dioceses, since, on the one hand, they have a considerably larger
number of members than the purely Catholic associations and, on the other
hand, if permission were denied serious disadvantages would result. In view
of the particular circumstances of Catholic affairs in Germany, We believe
that We should grant this petition. Furthermore, We declare that such mixed
associations as now exist within your dioceses can be tolerated and
Catholics may be permitted to join them, as long as such toleration does
not cease to be appropriate or permissible by reason of new and changed
conditions. Necessary precautions, however, must be adopted in order to
avoid the dangers which, as has already been mentioned, follow upon such
associations.

<p>The following are the most important of these precautions: In the first
place, provision should be made that Catholic workers who are members of
the trade unions must also belong to those Catholic associations which are
known as "Arbeitervereine." In the event that they must make some sacrifice
for this cause, even in a monetary way, We are convinced that they will
readily do so for the sake of safeguarding the integrity of their Faith. As
has been happily demonstrated, the Catholic workingmen's associations,
aided by the clergy and by its leadership and alert direction, are able to
achieve very much toward preserving the truths of religion and the purity
of morals among their members, and nourish the religious spirit through
frequent practices of piety. Therefore, the leaders of such associations,
clearly recognizing the needs of the age, are undoubtedly prepared to
instruct the workers about their duties in justice and charity, especially
regarding all those commandments and precepts in which an accurate
knowledge is needed or useful in order to enable them to take an active
part in their trade unions according to the principles of Catholic
doctrine.

<p>7. Furthermore, if Catholics are to be permitted to join the trade unions,
these associations must avoid everything that is not in accord, either in
principle or practice, with the teachings and commandments of the Church or
the proper ecclesiastical authorities. Similarly, everything is to be
avoided in their literature or public utterances or actions which in the
above view would incur censure.

<p>The Bishops, therefore, should consider it their sacred duty to observe
carefully the conduct of all these associations and to watch diligently
that the Catholic members do not suffer any harm as a result of their
participation. The Catholic members themselves, however, should never
permit the unions, whether for the sake of material interests of their
members or the union cause as such, to proclaim or support teachings or to
engage in activities which would conflict in any way with the directives
proclaimed by the supreme teaching authority of the Church, especially
those mentioned above. Therefore, as often as problems arise concerning
matters of justice or charity, the Bishops should take the greatest care to
see that the faithful do not overlook Catholic moral teaching and do not
depart from it even a finger's breadth.

<p>8. We are convinced, Venerable Brethren, that you will diligently take care
to see that all these directives of Ours are conscientiously and exactly
fulfilled, carefully and constantly reporting to Us concerning this very
serious problem. Since We have taken this matter under Our jurisdiction
and, after hearing the views of the Bishops, since the decision rests with
Us, We hereby command all Catholics of good will to desist from all
disputes among themselves concerning this matter. We are confident that
with fraternal charity and perfect obedience they will completely and
gladly carry out Our command. If any further difficulty arises among them,
they should seek its solution in the following manner: Let them first turn
to their Bishops for counsel, and then submit the matter to the Apostolic
See for its decision.

<p>There is one more point to consider, and it was already implied in what has
been said. On the one hand, no one could accuse of bad faith and, under
such a pretext, bear ill will toward those who, while firmly defending the
teachings and rights of the Church, nonetheless for good reasons have
joined or wish to join mixed labor associations in those places where,
under certain safeguards, ecclesiastical authority has permitted them in
view of local conditions. On the other hand, it would likewise be most
reprehensible to oppose or attack the purely Catholic associations (this
type of association must, on the contrary, be supported and promoted in
every possible manner), and to demand that the so-called intercredal
associations be introduced and force their establishment on the grounds
that all Catholic associations in every diocese ought to be set up along
one and the same pattern.

<p>9. While expressing Our desire that Catholic Germany may make great
progress in religion and civil life, and in order that this wish may be
happily fulfilled, We beseech for the beloved German people the special
help of Almighty God and the protection of the Virgin Mother of God, the
Queen of Peace. As a pledge of the divine graces and also as sign of Our
particular love, We impart, most lovingly, to you, Beloved Son and
Venerable Brethren, to your clergy and people, the Apostolic Blessing.

<p>10. Given at Saint Peter's, Rome, on September 24, 1912, the tenth year of
Our Pontificate.
