<h1>Spectata Fides</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical on Christian Education
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>November 27, 1885</b>

<p><i>To Our Venerable Brethren, Henry Edward, Cardinal Priest of the Holy Roman Church, of the Title of SS. Andrew and Gregory on the Coelian Hill, Archbishop of Westminster, and the other Bishops of England.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>YOUR PROVED FIDELITY and singular devotion to this Apostolic See are
admirably shown in the Letter which We have lately received from you. Our
pleasure in receiving it is indeed increased by the further knowledge which
it gives Us of your great vigilance and anxiety, in a matter where no care
can be too great: We mean the Christian education of your children, upon
which you have lately taken counsel together, and have reported to us the
decisions to which you came.

<p>2. In this work of so great moment, Venerable Brethren, We rejoice much to
see that you do not work alone; for We know how much is due to the whole
body of your clergy. With the greatest charity, and with unconquered
efforts, they have provided schools for their children; and, with wonderful
diligence and assiduity, they endeavor by their teaching to form them to a
Christian life, and to instruct them in the elements of knowledge.
Wherefore, with all the encouragement and praise that Our voice can give,
We bid your clergy to go on in their meritorious work, and to be assured of
Our special commendation and good will, looking forward to a far greater
reward from our Lord God for Whose sake they are laboring.

<p>3. Not less worthy of commendation is the generosity of Catholics in this
matter. We know how readily they supply what is needed for the maintenance
of schools; not only those who are wealthy, but those also who are of
slender means, and poor; and it is beautiful to see how, often from the
earnings of their poverty, they willingly contribute to the education of
children.

<p>4. In these days, and in the present condition of the world, when the
tender age of childhood is threatened on every side by so many and such
various dangers, hardly anything can be imagined more fitting than the
union with literary instruction of sound teaching in faith and morals. For
this reason We have more than once said that We strongly approve of the
Voluntary schools, which, by the work and liberality of private
individuals, have been established in France, in Belgium, in America, and
in the colonies of the British Empire. We desire their increase, as much as
possible, and that they may flourish in the number of their scholars. We
Ourselves also, seeing the condition of things in this city, continue, with
the greatest effort and at great cost, to provide an abundance of such
schools for the children of Rome. For it is in and by these schools that
the Catholic faith, our greatest and best inheritance, is preserved whole
and entire. In these schools the liberty of parents is respected; and, what
is most needed, especially in the prevailing license of opinion and of
action, it is by these schools that good citizens are brought up for the
State; for there is no better citizen than the man who has believed and
practiced the Christian faith from his childhood. The beginning and, as it
were, the seed of that human perfection which Jesus Christ gave to mankind,
are to be found in the Christian education of the young; for the future
condition of the State depends upon the early training of its children. The
wisdom of our forefathers, and the very foundations of the State, are
ruined by the destructive error of those who would have children brought up
without religious education. You see, therefore Venerable Brethren, with
what earnest forethought parents must beware of entrusting their children
to schools in which they cannot receive religious teaching.

<p>5. In your country of Great Britain We know that, besides yourselves, very
many of your nation are not a little anxious about religious education.
They do not in all things agree with Us; nevertheless they see how
important, for the sake both of society and of men individually, is the
preservation of that Christian wisdom which your forefathers received
through St. Augustine, from Our Predecessor, Gregory the Great: which
wisdom the violent tempests that came afterwards have not entirely
scattered. There are, as We know, at this day, many of an excellent
disposition of mind, who are diligently striving to retain what they can of
the ancient faith, and who bring forth many and great fruits of charity. As
often as We think of this, so often are we deeply moved, for We love with a
paternal charity that island which was not undeservedly called the Mother
of Saints; and We see, in the disposition of mind of which We have spoken,
the greatest hope and, as it were, a pledge of the welfare and prosperity
of the British people.

<p>6. Go on, therefore, Venerable Brethren, in making the young your chief
care; press onward in every way your episcopal work; and cultivate with
alacrity and hopefulness whatever good seeds you find: for God, Who is rich
in mercy will give the increase.

<p>7. As a pledge of gifts from above, and in witness of Our good will, We
lovingly grant in the Lord to you, and to the clergy and people committed
to each one of you, the Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, on the 27th day of November, in the year
1885, the eighth year of Our Pontificate.
