<h1>Sublimus Dei</h1>  
<p><b>His Holiness Pope Paul III<br>May 29, 1537</b>

<p><i>Paul III Pope. To all faithful Christians to whom this writing may come, health in Christ our Lord and the apostolic benediction.</i>

<p>THE SUBLIME GOD so loved the human race that He created man in such
wise that he might participate, not only in the good that other
creatures enjoy, but endowed him with capacity to attain to the
inaccessible and invisible Supreme Good and behold it face to face; and
since man, according to the testimony of the sacred scriptures, has been
created to enjoy eternal life and happiness, which none may obtain save
through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, it is necessary that he should
possess the nature and faculties enabling him to receive that faith; and
that whoever is thus endowed should be capable of receiving that same
faith. Nor is it credible that any one should possess so little
understanding as to desire the faith and yet be destitute of the most
necessary faculty to enable him to receive it. Hence Christ, who is the
Truth itself, that has never failed and can never fail, said to the
preachers of the faith whom He chose for that office 'Go ye and teach
all nations.' He said all, without exception, for all are capable of
receiving the doctrines of the faith.

<p>The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to
bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means
never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's
word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to
please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the
West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge
should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending
that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.

<p>We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and
seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are
outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that
the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of
understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they
desire exceedingly to receive it. Desiring to provide ample remedy for
these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any
translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal
of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given
as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may
be said to the contrary, the said Indians and all other people who may
later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of
their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be
outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely
and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their
property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary
happen, it shall be null and have no effect.

<p>By virtue of Our apostolic authority We define and declare by these
present letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary
public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, which
shall thus command the same obedience as the originals, that the said
Indians and other peoples should be converted to the faith of Jesus
Christ by preaching the word of God and by the example of good and holy
living.
