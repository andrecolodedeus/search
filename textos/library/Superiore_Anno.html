<h1>Superiore Anno</h1>  
<p><b>On the Recitation of the Rosary
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>August 30, 1884</b>

<p><i>To All Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World in the Grace and Communion of the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>LAST YEAR, as each of you is aware, We decreed by an Encyclical
Letter that, to win the help of Heaven for the Church in her trials,
the great Mother of God should be honored by the means of the
most holy Rosary during the whole of the month of October. In
this We followed both Our own impulse and the example of Our
predecessors, who in times of difficulty were wont to have
recourse with increased fervor to the Blessed Virgin, and to seek
her aid with special prayers. That wish of Ours has been
complied with, with such a willingness and unanimity that it is
more than ever apparent how real is the religion and how great is
the fervor of the Christian peoples, and how great is the trust
everywhere placed in the heavenly patronage of the Virgin Mary.
For Us, weighed down with the burden of such and so great trials
and evils, We confess that the sight of such intensity of open
piety and faith has been a great consolation, and even gives Us
new courage for the facing, if that be the wish of God, of still
greater trials. Indeed, from the spirit of prayer which is poured
out over the house of David and the dwellers in Jerusalem, we
have a confident hope that God will at length let Himself be
touched and have pity upon the state of His Church, and give ear
to the prayers coming to Him through her whom He has chosen to
be the dispenser of all heavenly graces.

<p>2. For these reasons, therefore, with the same causes in existence
which impelled Us last year, as We have said, to rouse the piety
of all, We have deemed it Our duty to exhort again this year the
people of Christendom to persevere in that method and formula
of prayer known as the Rosary of Mary, and thereby to merit the
powerful patronage of the great Mother of God. In as much as the
enemies of Christianity are so stubborn in their aims, its
defenders must be equally staunch, especially as the heavenly
help and the benefits which are bestowed on us by God are the
more usually the fruits of our perseverance. It is good to recall to
memory the example of that illustrious widow, Judith--a type of
the Blessed Virgin--who curbed the ill-judged impatience of the
Jews when they attempted to fix, according to their own
judgment, the day appointed by God for the deliverance of His
city. The example should also be borne in mind of the Apostles,
who awaited the supreme gift promised unto them of the
Paraclete, and persevered unanimously in prayer with Mary the
Mother of Jesus. For it is indeed, an arduous and exceeding
weighty matter that is now in hand: it is to humiliate an old and
most subtle enemy in the spread-out array of his power; to win
back the freedom of the Church and of her Head; to preserve and
secure the fortifications within which should rest in peace the
safety and weal of human society. Care must be taken, therefore,
that, in these times of mourning for the Church, the most holy
devotion of the Rosary of Mary be assiduously and piously
observed, the more so that this method of prayer being so
arranged as to recall in turn all the mysteries of our salvation, is
eminently fitted to foster the spirit of piety.

<p>3. With respect to Italy, it is now most necessary to implore the
intercession of the most powerful Virgin through the medium of
the Rosary, since a misfortune, and not an imaginary one, is
threatening--nay, rather is among us. The Asiatic cholera, having,
under God's will, crossed the boundary within which nature
seemed to have confined it, has spread through the crowded
shores of a French port, and thence to the neighboring districts of
Italian soil.--To Mary, therefore, we must fly--to her whom rightly
and justly the Church entitles the dispenser of saving, aiding,
and protecting gifts--that she, graciously hearkening to our
prayers, may grant us the help they besought, and drive far from
us the unclean plague.

<p>4. We have therefore resolved that in this coming month of
October, in which the sacred devotions to Our Virgin Lady of the
Rosary are solemnized throughout the Catholic world, all the
devotions shall again be observed which were commanded by Us
this time last year.--We therefore decree and make order that
from the 1st of October to the 2nd of November following in all
the parish churches (curialibus templis), in all public churches
dedicated to the Mother of God, or in such as are appointed by
the Ordinary, five decades at least of the Rosary be recited,
together with the Litany. If in the morning, the Holy Sacrifice will
take place during these prayers; if in the evening, the Blessed
Sacrament will be exposed for the adoration of the faithful; after
which those present will receive the customary Benediction. We
desire that, wherever it be lawful, the local confraternity of the
Rosary should make a solemn procession through the streets as a
public manifestation of religious devotion.

<p>5. That the heavenly treasures of the Church may be thrown open
to all, We hereby renew every Indulgence granted by Us last year.
To all those, therefore, who shall have assisted on the prescribed
days at the public recital of the Rosary, and have prayed for Our
intentions--to all those also who from legitimate causes shall
have been compelled to do so in private--We grant for each
occasion an Indulgence of seven years and seven times forty
days. To those who, in the prescribed space of time shall have
performed these devotions at least ten times--either publicly in
the churches or from just causes in the privacy of their homes--
and shall have expiated their sins by confession and have
received Communion at the altar, We grant from the treasury of
the Church a Plenary Indulgence. We also grant this full
forgiveness of sins and plenary remission of punishment to all
those who, either on the feast day itself of Our Blessed Lady of
the Rosary, or on any day within the subsequent eight days, shall
have washed the stains from their souls and have holily partaken
of the Divine banquet, and shall have also prayed in any church
to God and His most holy Mother for Our intentions. As We desire
also to consult the interests of those who live in country districts,
and are hindered, especially in the month of October, by their
agricultural labors, We permit all We have above decreed, and
also the holy Indulgences gainable in the month of October, to be
postponed to the following months of November or December,
according to the prudent decision of the Ordinaries.

<p>6. We doubt not, Venerable Brethren, that rich and abundant
fruits will be the result of these efforts, especially if God, by the
bestowal of His heavenly graces, bring an added increase to the
fields planted by Us and watered by your zeal. We are certain that
the faithful of Christendom will hearken to the utterance of Our
Apostolic authority with the same fervor of faith and piety of
which they gave most ample evidence last year. May our
Heavenly Patroness, invoked by us through the Rosary, graciously
be with us and obtain that, all disagreements of opinion being
removed and Christianity restored throughout the world, we may
obtain from God the wished for peace in the Church.--In pledge of
that boon, to you, your clergy, and the flock entrusted to your
care, We lovingly bestow the Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, the 30th of August, 1884, in the
Seventh Year of Our Pontificate.
