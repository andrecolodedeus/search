<h1>Supremi Apostolatus Officio</h1>  
<p><b>Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII on the Devotion of the Holy Rosary (September 1, 1883)</b>

<p><i>To all the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops and Bishops of the Catholic World in the Grace and Communion of the Apostolic See.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren, Health and the Apostolic Benediction.

<p>The supreme apostolic office which we discharge and the exceedingly
difficult condition of these times, daily warn and almost compel Us to
watch carefully over the integrity of the Church, the more that the
calamities from which she suffers are greater. While, therefore, we
endeavor in every way to preserve the rights of the Church and to obviate
or repel present or contingent dangers, We constantly seek for help from
Heaven--the sole means of effecting anything--that our labors and our
care may obtain their wished for object. We deem that there could be no
surer and more efficacious means to this end than by religion and piety
to obtain the favor of the great <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, the Mother of God, the
guardian of our peace and the minister to us of heavenly grace, who is
placed on the highest summit of power and glory in Heaven, in order that
she may bestow the help of her patronage on men who through so many
labors and dangers are striving to reach that eternal city. Now that the
anniversary, therefore, of manifold and exceedingly great favors obtained
by a Christian people through the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is at hand, We
desire that that same devotion should be offered by the whole Catholic
world with the greatest earnestness to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, that by her
intercession her Divine Son may be appeased and softened in the evils
which afflict us. And therefore We determined, Venerable Brethren, to
despatch to you these letters in order that, informed of Our designs,
your authority and zeal might excite the piety of your people to conform
themselves to them.

<p>2. It has always been the habit of Catholics in danger and in troublous
times to fly for refuge to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and to seek for peace in her maternal
goodness; showing that the Catholic Church has always, and with justice,
put all her hope and trust in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. And truly the Immaculate
Virgin, chosen to be the Mother of God and thereby associated with Him in
the work of man's salvation, has a favor and power with her Son greater
than any human or angelic creature has ever obtained, or ever can gain.
And, as it is her greatest pleasure to grant her help and comfort to
those who seek her, it cannot be doubted that she would deign, and even
be anxious, to receive the aspirations of the universal Church.

<p>3. This devotion, so great and so confident, to the august Queen of
Heaven, has never shone forth with such brilliancy as when the militant
Church of God has seemed to be endangered by the violence of heresy
spread abroad, or by an intolerable moral corruption, or by the attacks
of powerful enemies. Ancient and modern history and the more sacred
annals of the Church bear witness to public and private supplications
addressed to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, to the help she has granted in return,
and to the peace and tranquillity which she had obtained from God. Hence
her illustrious titles of helper, consoler, mighty in war, victorious,
and peace-giver. And amongst these is specially to be commemorated that
familiar title derived from the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> by which the signal benefits she
has gained for the whole of Christendom have been solemnly perpetuated.
There is none among you, venerable brethren, who will not remember how
great trouble and grief God's Holy Church suffered from the Albigensian
heretics, who sprung from the sect of the later Manicheans, and who
filled the South of France and other portions of the Latin world with
their pernicious errors, and carrying everywhere the terror of their
arms, strove far and wide to rule by massacre and ruin. Our merciful God,
as you know, raised up against these most direful enemies a most holy
man, the illustrious parent and founder of the Dominican Order. Great in
the integrity of his doctrine, in his example of virtue, and by his
apostolic labors, he proceeded undauntedly to attack the enemies of the
Catholic Church, not by force of arms, but trusting wholly to that
devotion which he was the first to institute under the name of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, which was disseminated through the length and breadth of the
earth by him and his pupils. Guided, in fact, by divine inspiration and
grace, he foresaw that this devotion, like a most powerful warlike
weapon, would be the means of putting the enemy to flight, and of
confounding their audacity and mad impiety. Such was indeed its result.
Thanks to this new method of prayer--when adopted and properly carried
out as instituted by the Holy Father St. Dominic--piety, faith, and union
began to return, and the projects and devices of the heretics to fall to
pieces. Many wanderers also returned to the way of salvation, and the
wrath of the impious was restrained by the arms of those Catholics who
had determined to repel their violence.

<p>4. The efficacy and power of this devotion was also wondrously exhibited
in the sixteenth century, when the vast forces of the Turks threatened to
impose on nearly the whole of Europe the yoke of superstition and
barbarism. At that time the Supreme Pontiff, St. Pius V, after rousing
the sentiment of a common defense among all the Christian princes,
strove, above all, with the greatest zeal, to obtain for Christendom the
favor of the most powerful <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. So noble an example offered to
heaven and earth in those times rallied around him all the minds and
hearts of the age. And thus Christ's faithful warriors, prepared to
sacrifice their life and blood for the salvation of their faith and their
country, proceeded undauntedly to meet their foe near the Gulf of
Corinth, while those who were unable to take part formed a pious band of
supplicants, who called on <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and unitedly saluted her again and again
in the words of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, imploring her to grant the victory to their
companions engaged in battle. Our Sovereign Lady did grant her aid; for
in the naval battle by the Echinades Islands, the Christian fleet gained
a magnificent victory, with no great loss to itself, in which the enemy
were routed with great slaughter. And it was to preserve the memory of
this great boon thus granted, that the same Most Holy Pontiff desired
that a feast in honor of Our Lady of Victories should celebrate the
anniversary of so memorable a struggle, the feast which Gregory XIII
dedicated under the title of "The Holy Rosary." Similarly, important
successes were in the last century gained over the Turks at Temeswar, in
Pannonia, and at Corfu; and in both cases these engagements coincided
with feasts of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and with the conclusion of public
devotions of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. And this led our predecessor, Clement XI., in
his gratitude, to decree that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother of God</a> should every year
be especially honored in her <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> by the whole Church.

<p>5. Since, therefore, it is clearly evident that this form of prayer is
particularly pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and that it is especially
suitable as a means of defense for the Church and all Christians, it is
in no way wonderful that several others of Our Predecessors have made it
their aim to favor and increase its spread by their high recommendations.
Thus Urban IV. testified that "every day the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> obtained fresh boon
for Christianity." Sixtus IV. declared that this method of prayer
"redounded to the honor of God and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and was well
suited to obviate impending dangers;" Leo X. that "it was instituted to
oppose pernicious heresiarchs and heresies;" while Julius III. called it
"the glory of the Church." So also St. Pius V., that "with the spread of
this devotion the meditations of the faithful have begun to be more
inflamed, their prayers more fervent, and they have suddenly become
different men; the darkness of heresy has been dissipated, and the light
of Catholic faith has broken forth again." Lastly Gregory XIII in his
turn pronounced that "the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> had been instituted by St. Dominic to
appease the anger of God and to implore the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>."

<p>6. Moved by these thoughts and by the examples of Our Predecessors, We
have deemed it most opportune for similar reasons to institute solemn
prayers and to endeavor by adopting those addressed to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>
in the recital of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> to obtain from her son Jesus Christ a
similar aid against present dangers. You have before your eyes, Venerable
Brethren, the trials to which the Church is daily exposed; Christian
piety, public morality, nay, even faith itself, the supreme good and
beginning of all the other virtues, all are daily menaced with the
greatest perils.

<p>7. Nor are you only spectators of the difficulty of the situation, but
your charity, like Ours, is keenly wounded; for it is one of the most
painful and grievous sights to see so many souls, redeemed by the blood
of Christ, snatched from salvation by the whirlwind of an age of error,
precipitated into the abyss of eternal death. Our need of divine help is
as great today as when the great Dominic introduced the use of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary
of Mary</a> as a balm for the wounds of his contemporaries.

<p>8. That great saint indeed, divinely enlightened, perceived that no
remedy would be more adapted to the evils of his time than that men
should return to Christ, who "is the way, the truth, and the life," by
frequent meditation on the salvation obtained for Us by Him, and should
seek the intercession with God of that Virgin, to whom it is given to
destroy all heresies. He therefore so composed the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> as to recall
the mysteries of our salvation in succession, and the subject of
meditation is mingled and, as it were, interlaced with the Angelic
salutation and with the prayer addressed to God, the Father of Our Lord
Jesus Christ. We, who seek a remedy for similar evils, do not doubt
therefore that the prayer introduced by that most blessed man with so
much advantage to the Catholic world, will have the greatest effect in
removing the calamities of our times also. Not only do We earnestly
exhort all Christians to give themselves to the recital of the pious
devotion of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> publicly, or privately in their own house and
family, and that unceasingly, but we also desire that the whole of the
month of October in this year should be consecrated to the Holy Queen of
the Rosary. We decree and order that in the whole Catholic world, during
this year, the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> shall be solemnly celebrated by
special and splendid services. From the first day of next October,
therefore, until the second day of the November following, in every
parish and, if the ecclesiastical authority deem it opportune and of use,
in every chapel dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>--let five decades of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> be recited with the addition of the Litany of Loreto. We desire
that the people should frequent these pious exercises; and We will that
either Mass shall be said at the altar, or that the Blessed Sacrament
shall be exposed to the adoration of the faithful, Benediction being
afterwards given with the Sacred Host to the pious congregation. We
highly approve of the confraternities of the Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin going in procession, following ancient custom, through the town,
as a public demonstration of their devotion. And in those places where
this is not possible, let it be replaced by more assiduous visits to the
churches, and let the fervor of piety display itself by a still greater
diligence in the exercise of the Christian virtues.

<p>9. In favor of those who shall do as We have above laid down, We are
pleased to open the heavenly treasure-house of the Church that they may
find therein at once encouragements and rewards for their piety. We
therefore grant to all those who, in the prescribed space of time, shall
have taken part in the public recital of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and the Litanies, and
shall have prayed for Our intention, seven years and seven times forty
days of indulgence, obtainable each time. We will that those also shall
share in these favors who are hindered by a lawful cause from joining in
these public prayers of which We have spoken, provided that they shall
have practiced those devotions in private and shall have prayed to God
for Our intention. We remit all punishment and penalties for sins
committed, in the form of a Pontifical indulgence, to all who, in the
prescribed time, either publicly in the churches or privately at home
(when hindered from the former by lawful cause) shall have at least twice
practiced these pious exercises; and who shall have, after due
confession, approached the holy table. We further grant a plenary
indulgence to those who, either on the feast of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> of the
<a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> or within its octave, after having similarly purified their souls
by a salutary confession, shall have approached the table of Christ and
prayed in some church according to Our intention to God and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> for the necessities of the Church.

<p>10. And you, Venerable Brethren,--the more you have at heart the honor of
<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and the welfare of human society, the more diligently apply
yourselves to nourish the piety of the people towards the great Virgin,
and to increase their confidence in her. We believe it to be part of the
designs of Providence that, in these times of trial for the Church, the
ancient devotion to the august Virgin should live and flourish amid the
greatest part of the Christian world. May now the Christian nations,
excited by Our exhortations, and inflamed by your appeals, seek the
protection of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> with an ardor growing greater day by day; let them
cling more and more to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, to that devotion which
our ancestors were in the habit of practicing, not only as an ever-ready
remedy for their misfortunes, but as a whole badge of Christian piety.
The heavenly Patroness of the human race will receive with joy these
prayers and supplications, and will easily obtain that the good shall
grow in virtue, and that the erring should return to salvation and
repent; and that God who is the avenger of crime, moved to mercy and pity
may deliver Christendom and civil society from all dangers, and restore
to them peace so much desired.

<p>11. Encouraged by this hope, We beseech God Himself, with the most
earnest desire of Our heart, through her in whom he has placed the
fullness of all good, to grant you. Venerable Brethren, every gift of
heavenly blessing. As an augury and pledge of which, We lovingly impart
to you, to your clergy, and to the people entrusted to your care, the
Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, the 1st of September, 1883, in the sixth
year of Our Pontificate.
