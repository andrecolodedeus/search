<h1>Television and the Family</h1>  
<p><b>Message for World Communications Day 1994
<br>His Holiness Pope John Paul II
<br>May 15, 1994</b>

<p>Dear brothers and sisters,

<p>IN RECENT DECADES, television has spearheaded a communications revolution
which has profoundly affected family life. Today television is a primary
source of news, information and entertainment for countless families,
shaping their attitudes and opinions, their values and patterns of behavior.

<p>Television can enrich family life. It can draw family members closer
together and foster their solidarity with other families and with the
community at large. It can increase not only their general knowledge but
also their religious knowledge, making it possible for them to hear God's
word, to strengthen their religious identity and to nurture their moral
and spiritual life.

<p>Television can also harm family life: by propagating degrading values and
models of behavior; by broadcasting pornography and graphic depictions of
brutal violence; by inculcating moral relativism and religious skepticism;
by spreading distorted, manipulative accounts of news events and current
issues; by carrying exploitative advertising that appeals to base
instincts, and by glorifying false visions of life that obstruct the
realization of mutual respect, of justice and of peace.

<p>Even when television programs themselves are not morally objectionable,
television can still have negative effects on the family. It can isolate
family members in their private worlds, cutting them off from authentic
interpersonal relations; it can also divide the family by alienating
parents from children and children from parents.

<p>Because the moral and spiritual renewal of the human family as a whole
must be rooted in the authentic renewal of individual families, the theme
for the 1994 World Communications Day -- "Television and the Family:
Guidelines for Good Viewing" -- is especially timely, particularly during
this International Year of the Family, when the world community is seeking
ways to strengthen family life.

<p>In this message, I wish especially to highlight the responsibilities of
parents, of the men and women of the television industry, of public
authorities, and of those with pastoral and educational duties in the
Church. In their hands lies the power to make television an ever more
effective medium in helping families to fulfill their roles as a force for
moral and social renewal.

<p>God has entrusted parents with the grave responsibility of helping their
children "to seek the truth from their earliest years and to live in
conformity with the truth, to seek the good and promote it" (Message for
the 1991 World Day of Peace, No. 3) It is therefore their duty to lead
their children to appreciate "whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
gracious" (Phil 4:8).

<p>Thus, besides being discriminating television viewers themselves, parents
should actively help to form in their children viewing habits conducive to
sound development, human, moral and religious. Parents should inform
themselves in advance about program content and make a conscious choice on
that basis for the good of the family -- to watch or not to watch. Reviews
and evaluations provided by religious agencies and other responsible
groups -- together with sound media education programs -- can be helpful in
this regard. Parents should also discuss television with their children,
guiding them to regulate the amount and quality of their viewing, and to
perceive and judge the ethical values underlying particular programs,
because the family is "the privileged means for transmitting the religious
and cultural values which help the person to acquire his or her own
identity" (Message for the 1994 World Day of Peace, No. 2).

<p>Forming children's viewing habits will sometimes mean simply turning off
the television set: because there are better things to do, because
consideration for other family members requires it, or because
indiscriminate television viewing can be harmful. Parents who make
regular, prolonged use of television as a kind of electronic baby sitter
surrender their role as the primary educators of their children. Such
dependence on television can deprive family members of opportunities to
interact with one another through conversation, shared activities and
common prayer. Wise parents are also aware that even good programs should
be supplemented by other sources of news, entertainment, education and
culture.

<p>To guarantee that the television industry will safeguard the rights of the
family, parents should express their legitimate concerns to media managers
and producers. Sometimes they will find it useful to join with others in
associations which represent their interests in relation to the media, to
sponsors and advertisers, and to public authorities.

<p>Television personnel -- executives and managers, producers and directors,
writers and researchers, journalists, on-camera performers and technical
workers -- all have serious moral responsibilities to the families that make
up such a large part of their audience. In their professional and personal
lives, those who work in television should be committed to the family as
society's basic community of life, love and solidarity.

<p>Recognizing the influence of the medium in which they work, they should
promote sound moral and spiritual values, and avoid "anything that could
harm the family in its existence, its stability, its balance and its
happiness," including "eroticism or violence, the defense of divorce or of
antisocial attitudes among young people" (Paul VI, Message for the 1969
World Communications Day, No. 2.)

<p>Television is often required to deal with serious themes: with human
weakness and sin, and their consequences for individuals and society; with
the failings of social institutions, including government and religion;
with weighty questions about the meaning of life. It should treat these
subjects responsibly -- without sensationalism and with a sincere concern
for the good of society, as well as with scrupulous regard for the truth.
"The truth shall make you free" (Jn 8:32), Jesus said, and ultimately all
truth has its foundation in God, who is also the source of our freedom and
creativity.

<p>In fulfilling its public responsibilities, the television industry should
develop and observe a code of ethics which includes a commitment to
serving the needs of families and to promoting values supportive of family
life. Media councils, with members from both the industry and the general
public, are also a highly desirable way of making television more
responsive to the needs and values of its audiences.

<p>Whether television channels are under public or private management, they
represent a public trust for the service of the common good; they are not
the mere private preserve of commercial interests or an instrument of
power or propaganda for social, economic or political elites; they exist
to serve the well-being of society as a whole.

<p>Thus, as the fundamental "cell" of society, the family deserves to be
assisted and defended by appropriate measures of the state and other
institutions (cf. Message for the 1994 World Day of Peace, No. 5). This
points to certain responsibilities on the part of public authorities where
television is concerned.

<p>Recognizing the importance of a free exchange of ideas and information,
the Church supports freedom of speech and of the press (cf. "Gaudium et
Spes," 59). At the same time, she insists that "the rights of individuals,
families and society itself to privacy, public decency and the protection
of basic values" demand to be respected (Pontifical Council for Social
Communications, "Pornography and Violence in the Media: A Pastoral
Response," No. 21). Public authorities are invited to set and enforce
reasonable ethical standards for programming which will foster the human
and religious values on which family life is built, and will discourage
whatever is harmful. They should also encourage dialogue between the
television industry and the public, providing structures and forums to
make this possible.

<p>Church-related agencies, for their part, render an excellent service to
families by offering them media education and film and program evaluation.
Where resources permit, Church communications agencies can also help
families by producing and disseminating family-oriented programming, or by
promoting such programming. Episcopal conferences and dioceses should
consistently make the "family dimension" of television part of their
pastoral planning for communications (cf. Pontifical Council for Social
Communications, "Aetatis Novae," 21-23).

<p>Since television professionals are engaged in presenting a vision of life
to a vast audience, which includes children and young people, they can
profit from the pastoral ministry of the Church, which can help them to
appreciate those ethical and religious principles which give full meaning
to human and family life. "Typically, pastoral programs of this sort
should include ongoing formation which will help these men and women -- many
of whom sincerely wish to know and to do what is ethically and morally
right -- to integrate moral norms ever more fully into their professional
work as well as their private lives" (ibid., 19).

<p>The family, founded on marriage, is a unique communion of persons which
God has made the "natural and fundamental group unit of society"
(Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 16, 3). Television and the
other communications media have immense power to sustain and strengthen
such communion within the family, as well as solidarity with other
families and a spirit of service to society. Grateful for the contribution
to such communion within the family and among families which television as
a communications medium has made and can make, the Church -- herself a
communion in the truth and love of Jesus Christ, the Word of God -- takes
the occasion of World Communications Day 1994 to encourage families
themselves, media personnel and public authorities to realize to the full
their noble calling to strengthen and promote society's first and most
vital community, the family.
