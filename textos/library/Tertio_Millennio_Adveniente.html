<h1>Tertio Millennio Adveniente</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Letter "As the Third Millennium Draws Near"
<br>His Holiness Pope John Paul II
<br>November 14, 1994</b>

<p><i>To the bishops, priests and deacons, men and women religious, and all the
lay faithful.</i>

<p>AS THE THIRD MILLENNIUM OF THE NEW ERA DRAWS NEAR, our thoughts turn
spontaneously to the words of the apostle Paul, "When the fullness of time
had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman" (Gal. 4:4). The fullness
of time coincides with the mystery of the incarnation of the Word, of the
Son who is of one being with the Father, and with the mystery of the
redemption of the world. In this passage, St. Paul emphasizes that the Son
of God was born of woman, born under the law, and came into the world in
order to redeem all who were under the law so that they might receive
adoption as sons and daughters. And he adds, "Because you are sons, God has
sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying 'Abba! Father!"' His
conclusion is truly comforting: "So through God you are no longer a slave
but a son, and if a son then an heir" (Gal. 4:6-7).

<p>Paul's presentation of the mystery of the incarnation contains the
revelation of the mystery of the Trinity and the continuation of the Son's
mission in the mission of the Holy Spirit. The incarnation of the Son of
God, his conception and birth, is the prerequisite for the sending of the
Holy Spirit. This text of St. Paul thus allows the fullness of the mystery
of the redemptive incarnation to shine forth.

<p align=center><b>I. "JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY" (Heb 13:8)</b></p>

<p>2. In his Gospel Luke has handed down to us a concise narrative of the
circumstances of Jesus' birth: "In those days a decree went out from Caesar
Augustus that all the world should be enrolled . . . . And all went to be
enrolled, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from
the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of, David, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled
with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there,
the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her firstborn
son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because
there was no place for them in the inn" (2:1, 3-7).

<p>Thus was fulfilled what the Angel Gabriel foretold at the annunciation,
when he spoke to the Virgin of Nazareth in these words: "Hail, full of
grace, the Lord is with you" (Lk. 1:28). Mary was troubled by these words,
and so the divine messenger quickly added: "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you
have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and
bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be
called the Son of the Most High . . . . The Holy Spirit will come upon you and
the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be
born will be called holy, the Son of God" (Lk. 1:30-33, 35). Mary's reply
to the angel was unhesitating: "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let
it be to me according to your word" (Lk. 1:38). Never in human history did
so much depend, as it did then, upon the consent of one human creature.[1]

<p>3. John, in the Prologue of his Gospel, captures in one phrase all the
depth of the mystery of the incarnation. He writes, "And the Word became
flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his
glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father" (1:14). For John, the
incarnation of the eternal Word, of one being with the Father, took place
in the conception and birth of Jesus. The evangelist speaks of the Word who
in the beginning was with God, and through whom everything which exists was
made; the Word in whom was life, the life which was the light of men (cf.
1:1-4). Of the only-begotten Son, God from God, the apostle Paul writes
that he is "the firstborn of all creation" (Col. 1:15). God created the
world through the Word. The Word is eternal wisdom; the thought and
substantial image of God; "he reflects the glory of God and bears the very
stamp of his nature" (Heb. 1:3). Eternally begotten and eternally loved by
the Father, as God from God and light from light, he is the principle and
archetype of everything created by God in time.

<p>The fact that in the fullness of time the eternal Word took on the
condition of a creature gives a unique cosmic value to the event which took
place in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago. Thanks to the Word, the world of
creatures appears as a "cosmos," an ordered universe. And it is the same
Word who, by taking flesh, renews the cosmic order of creation. The Letter
to the Ephesians speaks of the purpose which God had set forth in Christ,
"as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in
heaven and things on earth" (1:9-10).

<p>4. Christ, the redeemer of the world, is the one mediator between God and
men, and there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved (cf.
Acts 4:12). As we read in the Letter to the Ephesians: "In him we have
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according
to the richness of his grace, which he has lavished upon us. For he has
made known to us in all wisdom and insight ... his purpose which he set
forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in
him, things in heaven and things on earth" (1:7-10). Christ, the Son who is
of one being with the Father, is therefore the one who reveals God's plan
for all creation, and for man in particular. In the memorable phrase of the
Second Vatican Council, Christ "fully reveals man to man himself and makes
his supreme calling clear."[2] He shows us this calling by revealing the
mystery of the Father and his love. As the image of the invisible God,
Christ is the perfect man who has restored to the children of Adam the
divine likeness which had been deformed by sin. In his human nature, free
from all sin and assumed into the divine person of the Word, the nature
shared by all human beings is raised to a sublime dignity: "By his
incarnation the Son of God united himself in some sense with every man. He
labored with human hands, thought with a human mind, acted with a human
will and loved with a human heart. Born of Mary the Virgin he truly became
one of us and, sin apart, was like us in every way."[3]

<p>5. This "becoming one of us" on the part of the Son of God took place in
the greatest humility, so it is no wonder that secular historians, caught
up by more stirring events and by famous personages, first made only
passing, albeit significant, references to him. Such references to Christ
are found for example in <i>The Antiquities of the Jews</i>, a work compiled in
Rome between the years 93 and 94 by the historian Flavius Josephus,[4] and
especially in the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus, written between the years 115 and
120, where, reporting the burning of Rome in the year 64, falsely
attributed by Nero to the Christians, the historian makes an explicit
reference to Christ "executed by order of the procurator Pontius Pilate
during the reign of Tiberius."[5] Suetonius, too, in his biography of the
emperor Claudius, written around 121, informs us that the Jews were
expelled from Rome because "under the instigation of a certain Chrestus
they stirred up frequent riots."[6] This passage is generally interpreted as
referring to Jesus Christ, who had become a source of contention within
Jewish circles in Rome. Also of importance as proof of the rapid spread of
Christianity is the testimony of Pliny the Younger, the governor of
Bithynia, who reported to the emperor Trajan, between the years 111 and
113, that a large number of people were accustomed to gather "on a
designated day, before dawn, to sing in alternating choirs a hymn to Christ
as to a God."[7]

<p>But the great event which non-Christian historians merely mention in
passing takes on its full significance in the writings of the New
Testament. These writings, although documents of faith, are no less
reliable as historical testimonies if we consider their references as a
whole. Christ, true God and true man, the Lord of the cosmos, is also the
Lord of history, of which he is "the Alpha and the Omega" (Rv. 1:8; 21:6),
"the beginning and the end" (Rv. 21:6). In him the Father has spoken the
definitive word about mankind and its history. This is expressed in a
concise and powerful way by the Letter to the Hebrews: "In many and various
ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last
days he has spoken to us by a Son" (1:1-2).

<p>6. Jesus was born of the chosen people, in fulfillment of the promise made
to Abraham and constantly recalled by the prophets. The latter spoke in
God's name and in his place. The economy of the Old Testament, in fact, was
essentially ordered to preparing and proclaiming the coming of Christ, the
redeemer of the universe, and of his messianic kingdom. The books of the
Old Covenant are thus a permanent witness to a careful divine pedagogy.[8] In
Christ this pedagogy achieves its purpose: Jesus does not in fact merely
speak "in the name of God like the prophets, but he is God himself speaking
in his eternal Word made flesh. Here we touch upon the essential point by
which Christianity differs from all the other religions by which man's
search for God has been expressed from earliest times. Christianity has its
starting point in the incarnation of the Word. Here it is not simply a case
of man seeking God, but of God who comes in person to speak to man of
himself and to show him the path by which he may be reached. This is what
is proclaimed in the Prologue of John's Gospel: "No one has ever seen God;
the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known"
(1:18). The incarnate Word is thus the fulfillment of the yearning present
in all the religions of mankind: This fulfillment is brought about by God
himself and transcends all human expectations. It is the mystery of grace.

<p>In Christ, religion is no longer a "blind search for God" (cf. Acts 17:27)
but the response of faith to God who reveals himself. It is a response in
which man speaks to God as his Creator and Father, a response made possible
by that one man who is also the consubstantial Word in whom God speaks to
each individual person and by whom each individual person is enabled to
respond to God. What is more, in this man all creation responds to God.
Jesus Christ is the new beginning of everything. In him all things come
into their own; they are taken up and given back to the Creator from whom
they first came. Christ is thus the fulfillment of the yearning of all the
world's religions and, as such, he is their sole and definitive completion.
Just as God in Christ speaks to humanity of himself, so in Christ all
humanity and the whole of creation speaks of itself to God-indeed, it gives
itself to God. Everything thus returns to its origin. Jesus Christ is the
recapitulation of everything (cf. Eph. 1:10) and at the same time the
fulfillment of all things in God: a fulfillment which is the glory of God.
The religion founded upon Jesus Christ is a religion of glory; it is a
newness of life for the praise of the glory of God (cf. Eph. 1:12). All
creation is in reality a manifestation of his glory. In particular, man
(<i>vivens homo</i>) is the epiphany of God's glory, man who is called to live
by the fullness of life in God.

<p>7. In Jesus Christ God not only speaks to man but also seeks him out. The
incarnation of the Son of God attests that God goes in search of man. Jesus
speaks of this search as the finding of a lost sheep (cf. Lk. 15:1-7). It
is a search which begins in the heart of God and culminates in the
incarnation of the Word. If God goes in search of man, created in his own
image and likeness, he does so because he loves him eternally in the Word
and wishes to raise him in Christ to the dignity of an adoptive son. God
therefore goes in search of man who is his special possession in a way
unlike any other creature. Man is God's possession by virtue of a choice
made in love: God seeks man out, moved by his fatherly heart.

<p>Why does God seek man out? Because man has turned away from him, hiding
himself as Adam did among the trees of the Garden of Eden (cf. Gn. 3:8-10).
Man allowed himself to be led astray by the enemy of God (cf. Gn. 3:13).
Satan deceived man, persuading him that he too was a god, that he, like
God, was capable of knowing good and evil, ruling the world according to
his own will without having to take into account the divine will (cf. Gn.
3:5). Going in search of man through his Son, God wishes to persuade man to
abandon the paths of evil which lead him farther and farther afield.
"Making him abandon" those paths means making man understand that he is
taking the wrong path; it means overcoming the evil which is everywhere
found in human history. Overcoming evil: This is the meaning of the
redemption. This is brought about in the sacrifice of Christ, by which man
redeems the debt of sin and is reconciled to God. The Son of God became
man, taking a body and soul in the womb of the Virgin, precisely for this
reason: to become the perfect redeeming sacrifice. The religion of the
incarnation is the religion of the world's redemption through the sacrifice
of Christ, wherein lies victory over evil, over sin and over death itself.
Accepting death on the cross, Christ at the same time reveals and gives
life because he rises again and death no longer has power over him.

<p>8. The religion which originates in the mystery of the redemptive
incarnation is the religion of "dwelling in the heart of God," of sharing
in God's very life. St. Paul speaks of this in the passage already quoted:
"God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba!
Father!"' (Gal 4:6). Man cries out like Christ himself, who turned to God
"with loud cries and tears" (Heb. 5:7), especially in Gethsemane and on the
cross: Man cries out to God just as Christ cried out to him, and thus he
bears witness that he shares in Christ's sonship through the power of the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, whom the Father has sent in the name of the
Son, enables man to share in the inmost life of God. He also enables man to
be a son, in the likeness of Christ, and an heir of all that belongs to the
Son (cf. Gal. 4:7). In this consists the religion of "dwelling in the
inmost life of God," which begins with the incarnation of the Son of God.
The Holy Spirit, who searches the depths of God (cf. 1 Cor. 2:10), leads
us, all mankind, into these depths by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ.

<p align=center><b>II. THE JUBILEE OF THE YEAR 2000</b></p>

<p>9. Speaking of the birth of the Son of God, St. Paul places this event in
the "fullness of time" (cf. Gal. 4:4). Time is indeed fulfilled by the very
fact that God, in the incarnation, came down into human history. Eternity
entered into time: What "fulfillment" could be greater than this? What
other "fulfillment" would be possible? Some have thought in terms of
certain mysterious cosmic cycles in which the history of the universe, and
of mankind in particular, would constantly repeat itself. True, man rises
from the earth and returns to it (cf. Gn. 3:19): This is an immediately
evident fact. Yet in man there is an irrepressible longing to live forever.
How are we to imagine a life beyond death? Some have considered various
forms of reincarnation: Depending on one's previous life, one would receive
a new life in either a higher or lower form until full purification is
attained. This belief, deeply rooted in some Eastern religions, itself
indicates that man rebels against the finality of death. He is convinced
that his nature is essentially spiritual and immortal.

<p>Christian revelation excludes reincarnation and speaks of a fulfillment
which man is called to achieve in the course of a single earthly existence.
Man achieves this fulfillment of his destiny through the sincere gift of
self, a gift which is made possible only through his encounter with God. It
is in God that man finds full self-realization: This is the truth revealed
by Christ. Man fulfills himself in God, who comes to meet him through his
eternal Son. Thanks to God's coming on earth, human time, which began at
creation, has reached its fullness. "The fullness of time" is in fact
eternity, indeed, it is the One who is eternal, God himself. Thus, to enter
into "the fullness of time" means to reach the end of time and to transcend
its limits in order to find time's fulfillment in the eternity of God.

<p>10. In Christianity time has a fundamental importance. Within the dimension
of time the world was created; within it the history of salvation unfolds,
finding its culmination in the "fullness of time" of the incarnation and
its goal in the glorious return of the Son of God at the end of time. In
Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, time becomes a dimension of God, who is
himself eternal. With the coming of Christ there begin "the last days" (cf.
Heb. 1:2), the "last hour" (cf. 1 Jn. 2:18) and the time of the Church,
which will last until the parousia.

<p>From this relationship of God with time there arises the duty to sanctify
time. This is done, for example, when individual times, days or weeks are
dedicated to God, as once happened in the religion of the old covenant and
as happens still, though in a new way, in Christianity. In the liturgy of
the Easter Vigil the celebrant, as he blesses the candle which symbolizes
the risen Christ, proclaims: "Christ yesterday and today, the beginning and
the end, alpha and omega, all time belongs to him, and all the ages, to him
be glory and power through every age forever." He says these words as he
inscribes on the candle the numerals of the current year. The meaning of
this rite is clear: It emphasizes the fact that Christ is the Lord of time;
he is its beginning and its end; every year, every day and every moment are
embraced by his incarnation and resurrection, and thus become part of the
"fullness of time." For this reason the Church too lives and celebrates the
liturgy in the span of a year. The solar year is thus permeated by the
liturgical year, which in a certain way reproduces the whole mystery of the
incarnation and redemption, beginning from the first Sunday of Advent and
ending on the solemnity of Christ the King, Lord of the universe and Lord
of history. Every Sunday commemorates the day of the Lord's resurrection.

<p>11. Against this background we can understand the custom of jubilees, which
began in the Old Testament and continues in the history of the Church.
Jesus of Nazareth, going back one day to the synagogue of his hometown,
stood up to read (cf. Lk. 4:16-30). Taking the book of the prophet Isaiah,
he read this passage: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the
Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me
to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the
opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the
Lord's favor" (61:1-2).

<p>The prophet was speaking of the Messiah. "Today," Jesus added, "this
scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" (Lk. 4:21), thus indicating
that he himself was the Messiah foretold by the prophet, and that the long-
expected "time" was beginning in him. The day of salvation had come, the
"fullness of time." All jubilees point to this "time" and refer to the
messianic mission of Christ, who came as the one "anointed" by the Holy
Spirit, the one "sent by the Father." It is he who proclaims the good news
to the poor. It is he who brings liberty to those deprived of it, who frees
the oppressed and gives back sight to the blind (cf. Mt. 11:4-5; Lk. 7:22).
In this way he ushers in "a year of the Lord's favor," which he proclaims
not only with his words but above all by his actions. The jubilee, "a year
of the Lord's favor," characterizes all the activity of Jesus; it is not
merely the recurrence of an anniversary in time.

<p>12. The words and deeds of Jesus thus represent the fulfillment of the
whole tradition of jubilees in the Old Testament. We know that the jubilee
was a time dedicated in a special way to God. It fell every seventh year,
according to the law of Moses: This was the "sabbatical year," during which
the earth was left fallow and slaves were set free. The duty to free slaves
was regulated by detailed prescriptions contained in the Books of Exodus
(23:10-11), Leviticus (25:1-28) and Deuteronomy (15:1-6). In other words,
these prescriptions are found in practically the whole of biblical
legislation, which is thus marked by this very specific characteristic. In
the sabbatical year, in addition to the freeing of slaves the law also
provided for the cancellation of all debts in accordance with precise
regulations. And all this was to be done in honor of God. What was true for
the sabbatical year was also true for the jubilee year, which fell every 50
years. In the jubilee year, however, the customs of the sabbatical year
were broadened and celebrated with even greater solemnity. As we read in
Leviticus: "You shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout
the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a jubilee for you, when each
of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his
family" (25:10). One of the most significant consequences of the jubilee
year was the general "emancipation" of all the dwellers on the land in need
of being freed. On this occasion every Israelite regained possession of his
ancestral land if he happened to have sold it or lost it by falling into
slavery. He could never be completely deprived of the land, because it
belonged to God; nor could the Israelites remain for ever in a state of
slavery, since God had "redeemed" them for himself as his exclusive
possession by freeing them from slavery in Egypt.

<p>13. The prescriptions for the jubilee year largely remained ideals-more a
hope than an actual fact. They thus be came a <i>prophetia futuri</i> insofar as
they foretold the freedom which would be won by the coming Messiah. Even
so, on the basis of the juridical norms contained in these prescriptions a
kind of social doctrine began to emerge, which would then more clearly
develop beginning with the New Testament. The jubilee year was meant to
restore equality among all the children of Israel, offering new
possibilities to families which had lost their property and even their
personal freedom. On the other hand, the jubilee year was a reminder to the
rich that a time would come when their Israelite slaves would once again
become their equals and would be able to reclaim their rights. At the times
prescribed by law, a jubilee year had to be proclaimed to assist those in
need. This was required by just government. Justice, according to the law
of Israel, consisted above all in the protection of the weak, and a king
was supposed to be outstanding in this regard, as the psalmist says: "He
delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper. He
has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy" (Ps.
72:12-13). The foundations of this tradition were strictly theological,
linked first of all with the theology of creation and with that of divine
providence. It was a common conviction, in fact, that to God alone, as
Creator, belonged the "<i>dominium altum</i>"- lordship over all creation and
over the earth in particular (cf. I v. 25:23). If in his providence God had
given the earth to humanity, that meant that he had given it to everyone.
Therefore the riches of creation were to be considered as a common good of
the whole of humanity. Those who possessed these goods as personal property
were really only stewards, ministers charged with working in the name of
God, who remains the sole owner in the full sense, since it is God's will
that created goods should serve everyone in a just way. The jubilee year
was meant to restore this social justice. The social doctrine of the
Church, which has always been a part of Church teaching and which has
developed greatly in the last century, particularly after the encyclical
<i>Rerum Novarum</i>, is rooted in the tradition of the jubilee year.

<p>14. What needs to be emphasized, however, is what Isaiah expresses in the
words "to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." For the Church, the
jubilee is precisely this "year of the Lord's favor," a year of the
remission of sins and of the punishments due to them, a year of
reconciliation between disputing parties, a year of manifold conversions
and of sacramental and extrasacramental penance. The tradition of jubilee
years involves the granting of indulgences on a larger scale than at other
times. Together with jubilees recalling the mystery of the incarnation, at
intervals of 100, 50 and 25 years, there are also jubilees which
commemorate the event of the redemption: the cross of Christ, his death on
Golgotha and the resurrection. On these occasions, the Church proclaims "a
year of the Lord's favor," and she tries to ensure that all the faithful
can benefit from this grace. That is why jubilees are celebrated not only
<i>in urbe</i> but also <i>extra urbem</i>: Traditionally the latter took place the
year after the celebration <i>in urbe</i>.

<p>15. In the lives of individuals, jubilees are usually connected with the
date of birth; but other anniversaries are also celebrated such as those of
baptism, confirmation, first communion, priestly or episcopal ordination
and the sacrament of marriage. Some of these anniversaries have parallels
in the secular world, but Christians always give them a religious
character. In fact, in the Christian view every jubilee-the 25th of
marriage or priesthood, known as "silver," the 50th, known as "golden," or
the 60th, known as "diamond"-is a particular year of favor for the
individual who has received one or other of the sacraments. What we have
said about individuals with regard to jubilees can also be applied to
communities or institutions. Thus we celebrate the centenary or the
millennium of the foundation of a town or city. In the Church we celebrate
the jubilees of parishes and dioceses. All these personal and community
jubilees have an important and significant role in the lives of individuals
and communities.

<p>In view of this, the 2,000 years which have passed since the birth of
Christ (prescinding from the question of its precise chronology) represent
an extraordinarily great jubilee, not only for Christians but indirectly
for the whole of humanity, given the prominent role played by Christianity
during these two millennia. It is significant that the calculation of the
passing years begins almost everywhere with the year of Christ's coming
into the world, which is thus the center of the calendar most widely used
today. Is this not another sign of the unparalleled effect of the birth of
Jesus of Nazareth on the history of mankind?

<p>16. The term <i>jubilee</i> speaks of joy; not just an inner joy but a
jubilation which is manifested outwardly, for the coming of God is also an
outward, visible, audible and tangible event, as St. John makes clear (cf.
1 Jn. 1: 1). It is thus appropriate that every sign of joy at this coming
should have its own outward expression. This will demonstrate that the
Church rejoices in salvation. She invites everyone to rejoice, and she
tries to create conditions to ensure that the power of salvation may be
shared by all. Hence the year 2000 will be celebrated as the Great Jubilee.

<p>With regard to its content this Great Jubilee will be, in a certain sense,
like any other. But at the same time it will be different, greater than any
other. For the Church respects the measurements of time: hours, days,
years, centuries. She thus goes forward with every individual, helping
everyone to realize how each of these measurements of time is imbued with
the presence of God and with his saving activity. In this spirit the Church
rejoices, gives thanks and asks forgiveness, presenting her petitions to
the Lord of history and of human consciences.

<p>Among the most fervent petitions which the Church makes to the Lord during
this important time, as the eve of the new millennium approaches, is that
unity among all Christians of the various confessions will increase until
they reach full communion. I pray that the jubilee will be a promising
opportunity for fruitful cooperation in the many areas which unite us;
these are unquestionably more numerous than those which divide us. It would
thus be quite helpful if, with due respect for the programs of the
individual churches and communities, ecumenical agreements could be reached
with regard to the preparation and celebration of the jubilee. In this way
the jubilee will bear witness even more forcefully before the world that
the disciples of Christ are fully resolved to reach full unity as soon as
possible in the certainty that "nothing is impossible with God."

<p align=center><b>III. PREPARATION FOR THE GREAT JUBILEE</b></p>

<p>17. In the Church's history every jubilee is prepared for by divine
providence. This is true also of the Great Jubilee of the year 2000. With
this conviction, we look today with a sense of gratitude and yet with a
sense of responsibility at all that has happened in human history since the
birth of Christ, particularly the events which have occurred between the
years 1000 and 2000. But in a very particular way we look with the eyes of
faith to our own century, searching out whatever bears witness not only to
man's history but also to God's intervention in human affairs.

<p>18. From this point of view we can affirm that the Second Vatican Council
was a providential event whereby the Church began the more immediate
preparation for the jubilee of the second millennium. It was a council
similar to earlier ones, yet very different; it was a council focused on
the mystery of Christ and his Church, and at the same time open to the
world. This openness was an evangelical response to recent changes in the
world, including the profoundly disturbing experiences of the 20th century,
a century scarred by the First and Second World Wars, by the experience of
concentration camps and by horrendous massacres. All these events
demonstrate most vividly that the world needs purification; it needs to be
converted.

<p>The Second Vatican Council is often considered as the beginning of a new
era in the life of the Church. This is true, but at the same time it is
difficult to overlook the fact that the council drew much from the
experiences and reflections of the immediate past, especially from the
intellectual legacy left by Pius XII. In the history of the Church, the
"old" and the "new" are always closely interwoven. The "new" grows out of
the "old," and the "old" finds a fuller expression in the "new." Thus it
was for the Second Vatican Council and for the activity of the popes
connected with the council, starting with John XXIII, continuing with Paul
VI and John Paul I, up to the present pope.

<p>What these popes have accomplished during and since the council, in their
magisterium no less than in their pastoral activity, has certainly made a
significant contribution to the preparation of that new springtime of
Christian life which will be revealed by the Great Jubilee if Christians
are docile to the action of the Holy Spirit.

<p>19. The council, while not imitating the sternness of John the Baptist who
called for repentance and conversion on the banks of the Jordan (cf. Lk.
3:1-7), did show something of the prophet of old, pointing out with fresh
vigor to the men and women of today that Jesus Christ is the "Lamb of God
who takes away the sin of the world" (Jn. 1:29), the redeemer of humanity
and the Lord of history. During the council, precisely out of a desire to
be fully faithful to her master, the Church questioned herself about her
own identity and discovered anew the depth of her mystery as the body and
the bride of Christ. Humbly heeding the word of God, she reaffirmed the
universal call to holiness; she made provision for the reform of the
liturgy, the "origin and summit" of her life; she gave impetus to the
renewal of many aspects of her life at the universal level and in the local
churches; she strove to promote the various Christian vocations, from those
of the laity to those of religious, from the ministry of deacons to that of
priests and bishops; and in a particular way she rediscovered episcopal
collegiality, that privileged expression of the pastoral service carried
out by the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter. On the basis
of this profound renewal, the council opened itself to Christians of other
denominations, to the followers of other religions and to all the people of
our time. No council had ever spoken so clearly about Christian unity,
about dialogue with non-Christian religions, about the specific meaning of
the old covenant and of Israel, about the dignity of each person's
conscience, about the principle of religious liberty, about the different
cultural traditions within which the Church carries out her missionary
mandate and about the means of social communication.

<p>20. The council's enormously rich body of teaching and the striking new
tone in the way it presented this content constitute as it were a
proclamation of new times. The council fathers spoke in the language of the
Gospel, the language of the Sermon on the Mount and the Beatitudes. In the
council's message God is presented in his absolute lordship over all
things, but also as the one who ensures the authentic autonomy of earthly
realities.

<p>The best preparation for the new millennium, therefore, can only be
expressed in a renewed commitment to apply, as faithfully as possible, the
teachings of Vatican II to the life of every individual and of the whole
Church. It was with the Second Vatican Council that, in the broadest sense
of the term, the immediate preparations for the Great Jubilee of the Year
2000 were really begun. If we look for an analogy in the liturgy, it could
be said that the yearly Advent liturgy is the season nearest to the spirit
of the council. For Advent prepares us to meet the one who was, who is and
who is to come (cf. Rv. 4:8).

<p>21. Part of the preparation for the approach of the Year 2000 is the series
of synods begun after the Second Vatican Council: general synods together
with continental, regional, national and diocesan synods. The theme
underlying them all is evangelization, or rather the new evangelization,
the foundations of which were laid down in the apostolic exhortation
<i>Evangelii Nuntiandi</i> of Pope Paul VI, issued in 1975 following the third
general assembly of the Synod of Bishops. These synods themselves are part
of the new evangelization: They were born of the Second Vatican Council's
vision of the Church. They open up broad areas for the participation of the
laity, whose specific responsibilities in the Church they define. They are
an expression of the strength which Christ has given to the entire people
of God, making it a sharer in his own messianic mission as prophet, priest
and king. Very eloquent in this regard are the statements of the dogmatic
constitution Lumen Gentium. The preparation for the Jubilee Year 2000 is
thus taking place throughout the whole Church, on the universal and local
levels, giving her a new awareness of the salvific mission she has received
from Christ. This awareness is particularly evident in the post-synodal
exhortations devoted to the mission of the laity, the formation of priests,
catechesis, the family, the value of penance and reconciliation in the life
of the Church and of humanity in general, as well as in the forthcoming one
to be devoted to the consecrated life.

<p>22. Special tasks and responsibilities with regard to the Great Jubilee of
the Year 2000 belong to the ministry of the bishop of Rome. In a certain
sense, all the popes of the past century have prepared for this jubilee.
With his program to renew all things in Christ, St. Pius X tried to
forestall the tragic developments which arose from the international
situation at the beginning of this century. The Church was aware of her
duty to act decisively to promote and defend the basic values of peace and
justice in the face of contrary tendencies in our time. The popes of the
period before the council acted with firm commitment, each in his own way:
Benedict XV found himself faced with the tragedy of the First World War;
Pius XI had to contend with the threats of totalitarian systems or systems
which did not respect human freedom in Germany, in Russia, in Italy, in
Spain, and even earlier still in Mexico. Pius XII took steps to counter the
very grave injustice brought about by a total contempt for human dignity at
the time of the Second World War. He also provided enlightened guidelines
for the birth of a new world order after the fall of the previous political
systems.

<p>Furthermore, in the course of this century the popes, following in the
footsteps of Leo XIII, systematically developed the themes of Catholic
social doctrine, expounding the characteristics of a just system in the
area of relations between labor and capital. We may recall the encyclical
<i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> of Pius XI, the numerous interventions of Pius XII, the
encyclicals <i>Mater et Magistra</i> and <i>Pacem in Terris</i> of John XXIII, the
encyclical <i>Populorum Progressio</i> and the apostolic letter <i>Octogesima
Adveniens</i> of Paul VI. I, too, have frequently dealt with this subject. I
specifically devoted the encyclical <i>Laborem Exercens</i> to the importance of
human labor, while in <i>Centesimus Annus</i> I wished to reaffirm the
relevance, 100 years later, of the doctrine presented in <i>Rerum Novarum</i>.
In my encyclical <i>Sollicitudo Rei Socialis</i> I had earlier offered a
systematic reformulation of the Church's entire social doctrine against the
background of the East-West confrontation and the danger of nuclear war.
The two elements of the Church's social doctrine-the safeguarding of human
dignity and rights in the sphere of a just relation between labor and
capital, and the promotion of peace-were closely joined in this text. The
papal messages of Jan. 1 each year, begun in 1968 in the pontificate of
Paul VI, are also meant to serve the cause of peace.

<p>23. Since the publication of the very first document of my pontificate I
have spoken explicitly of the Great Jubilee, suggesting that the time
leading up to it be lived as "a new Advent."[9] This theme has since
reappeared many times, and was dwelt upon at length in the encyclical
<i>Dominum et Vivificantem</i>.[10] In fact, preparing for the year 2000 has
become as it were a hermeneutical key of my pontificate. It is certainly
not a matter of indulging in a new millenarianism, as occurred in some
quarters at the end of the first millennium; rather, it is aimed at an
increased sensitivity to all that the Spirit is saying to the Church and to
the Churches (cf. Rv. 2:7 f), as well as to individuals through charisms
meant to serve the whole community. The purpose is to emphasize what the
Spirit is suggesting to the different communities, from the smallest ones,
such as the family, to the largest ones, such as nations and international
organizations, taking into account cultures, societies and sound
traditions. Despite appearances, humanity continues to await the revelation
of the children of God and lives by this hope, like a mother in labor, to
use the image employed so powerfully by St. Paul in his Letter to the
Romans (cf. 8: 19-22).

<p>24. Papal journeys have become an important element in the work of
implementing the Second Vatican Council. Begun by John XXIII on the eve of
the council with a memorable pilgrimage to Loreto and Assisi (1962), they
notably increased under Paul VI, who after first visiting the Holy Land
(1964) undertook nine other great apostolic journeys which brought him into
direct contact with the peoples of the different continents.

<p>The current pontificate has widened this program of travels even further,
starting with Mexico, on the occasion of the Third General Conference of
the Latin American Episcopate held in Puebla in 1979. In that same year
there was also the trip to Poland for the jubilee of the 900th anniversary
of the death of St. Stanislaus, bishop and martyr.

<p>The successive stages of these travels are well known. Papal journeys have
become a regular occurrence, taking in the particular churches in every
continent and showing concern for the development of ecumenical
relationships with Christians of various denominations. Particularly
important in this regard were the visits to Turkey (1979), Germany (1980),
England, Scotland and Wales (1982), Switzerland (1984), the Scandinavian
countries (1989) and most recently the Baltic countries (1993).

<p>At present, it is my fervent wish to visit Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina
and the Middle East: Lebanon, Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It would be very
significant if in the year 2000 it were possible to visit the places on the
road taken by the people of God of the Old Covenant, starting from the
places associated with Abraham and Moses, through Egypt and Mount Sinai, as
far as Damascus, the city which witnessed the conversion of St. Paul.

<p>25. In preparing for the year 2000, the individual churches have their own
role to play, as they celebrate with their own jubilees significant stages
in the salvation history of the various peoples. Among these regional or
local jubilees, events of great importance have included the millennium of
the baptism of Rus' in 1988[11] as also the 500th anniversary of the
beginning of evangelization in America (1492). Besides events of such wide-
ranging impact, we may recall others which, although not of universal
importance, are no less significant: For example, the millennium of the
baptism of Poland in 1966 and of the baptism of Hungary in 1968, together
with the 600th anniversary of the baptism of Lithuania in 1987. There will
soon also be celebrated the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis
(496), king of the Franks, and the 1,400th anniversary of the arrival of
St. Augustine in Canterbury (597), marking the beginning of the
evangelization of the Anglo-Saxon world.

<p>As far as Asia is concerned, the jubilee will remind us of the apostle
Thomas, who according to tradition brought the proclamation of the Gospel
at the very beginning of the Christian era to India, where missionaries
from Portugal would not arrive until about the year 1500. The current year
also marks the seventh centenary of the evangelization of China (1294), and
we are preparing to commemorate the spread of missionary work in the
Philippines with the erection of the Metropolitan See of Manila (1595). We
likewise look forward to the fourth centenary of the first martyrs in Japan
(1597).

<p>In Africa, where the first proclamation of the Gospel also dates back to
apostolic times, together with the 1,650th anniversary of the episcopal
consecration of the first bishop of the Ethiopians, St. Frumentius (c.
340), and the 500th anniversary of the beginning of the evangelization of
Angola in the ancient kingdom of the Congo (1491), nations such as
Cameroon, Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Burundi and Burkina
Faso are celebrating the centenaries of the arrival of the first
missionaries in their respective territories. Other African nations have
recently celebrated such centenaries.

<p>And how can we fail to mention the Eastern Churches, whose ancient
patriarchates are so closely linked to the apostolic heritage and whose
venerable theological, liturgical and spiritual traditions constitute a
tremendous wealth which is the common patrimony of the whole of
Christianity? The many jubilee celebrations in these churches and in the
communities which acknowledge them as the origin of their own apostolicity
recall the journey of Christ down the centuries, leading to the Great
Jubilee at the end of the second millennium.

<p>Seen in this light, the whole of Christian history appears to us as a
single river, into which many tributaries pour their waters. The year 2000
invites us to gather with renewed fidelity and ever deeper communion along
the banks of this great river: the river of revelation, of Christianity and
of the Church, a river which flows through human history starting from the
event which took place at Nazareth and then at Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.
This is truly the "river" which with its "streams," in the expression of
the psalm, "make glad the city of God" (46:4).

<p>26. The holy years celebrated in the latter part of this century have also
prepared for the year 2000. The holy year proclaimed by Paul VI in 1975 is
still fresh in our memory. The celebration of 1983 as the Year of
Redemption followed along the same lines. The Marian Year 1986/87 perhaps
struck a more resounding chord; it was eagerly awaited and profoundly
experienced in the individual local churches, especially at the Marian
shrines around the world. The encyclical <i>Redemptoris Mater</i>, issued on
that occasion, drew attention to the council's teaching on the presence of
the mother of God in the mystery of Christ and the Church: 2,000 years ago
the Son of God was made man by the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of
the immaculate Virgin Mary. The Marian Year was as it were an anticipation
of the jubilee and contained much of what will find fuller expression in
the year 2000.

<p>27. It would be difficult not to recall that the Marian Year took place
only shortly before the events of 1989. Those events remain surprising for
their vastness and especially for the speed with which they occurred. The
'80s were years marked by a growing danger from the Cold War. 1989 ushered
in a peaceful resolution which took the form, as it were, of an "organic"
development. In the light of this fact, we are led to recognize a truly
prophetic significance in the encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum</i>: Everything that
Pope Leo XIII wrote there about communism was borne out by these events, as
I emphasized in the encyclical <i>Centesimus Annus.</i>[12] In the unfolding of
those events one could already discern the invisible hand of providence at
work with maternal care: "Can a woman forget her infant?" (Is. 49:15).

<p>After 1989 however there arose new dangers and threats. In the countries of
the former Eastern bloc, after the fall of communism, there appeared the
serious threat of exaggerated nationalism, as is evident from events in the
Balkans and other neighboring areas. This obliges the European nations to
make a serious examination of conscience, and to acknowledge faults and
errors, both economic and political, resulting from imperialist policies
carried out in the previous and present centuries vis-a-vis nations whose
rights have been systematically violated.

<p>28. In the wake of the Marian Year, we are now observing the Year of the
Family, a celebration which is closely connected with the mystery of the
incarnation and with the very history of humanity. Thus there is good cause
to hope that the Year of the Family, inaugurated at Nazareth, will become,
like the Marian Year, another significant stage in preparation for the
Great Jubilee.

<p>With this in view, I wrote a "Letter to Families," the purpose of which was
to restate the substance of the Church's teaching on the family and to
bring this teaching, so to speak, into every home. At the Second Vatican
Council, the Church recognized her duty to promote the dignity of marriage
and the family.[13] The Year of the Family is meant to help make the
council's teaching in this regard a reality. Each family, in some way,
should be involved in the preparation for the Great Jubilee. Was it not
through a family, the family of Nazareth, that the Son of God chose to
enter into human history?

<p align=center><b>IV. IMMEDIATE PREPARATION</b></p>

<p>29. Against the background of this sweeping panorama a question arises: can
we draw up a specific program of initiatives for the immediate preparation
of the Great Jubilee? In fact, what has been said above already includes
some elements of such a program.

<p>A more detailed plan of specific events will call for widespread
consultation in order for it not to be artificial and difficult to
implement in the particular churches, which live in such different
conditions. For this reason I wished to consult the presidents of the
episcopal conferences and especially the cardinals.

<p>I am grateful to the members of the College of Cardinals who met in
extraordinary consistory June 13-14, 1994, considered numerous proposals
and suggested helpful guidelines. I also thank my brothers in the
episcopate who in various ways communicated valuable ideas, which I have
kept carefully in mind while writing this apostolic letter.

<p>30. The first recommendation which clearly emerged from the consultation
regards the period of preparation. Only a few years now separate us from
the year 2000: It seemed fitting to divide this period into two phases,
reserving the strictly preparatory phase for the last three years. It was
thought that the accumulation of many activities over the course of a
longer period of preparation would detract from its spiritual intensity. It
was therefore considered appropriate to approach the historic date with a
first phase, which would make the faithful aware of general themes, and
then to concentrate the direct and immediate preparation into a second
phase consisting of a three-year period wholly directed to the celebration
of the mystery of Christ the savior.

<p><b>A. First Phase</b>

<p>31. The first phase will therefore be of an ante-preparatory character; it
is meant to revive in the Christian people an awareness of the value and
meaning of the Jubilee of the Year 2000 in human history. As a
commemoration of the birth of Christ, the jubilee is deeply charged with
Christological significance.

<p>In keeping with the unfolding of the Christian faith in word and sacrament,
it seems important, even in this special anniversary, to link the structure
of memorial with that of celebration, not limiting commemoration of the
event only to ideas but also making its saving significance present through
the celebration of the sacraments. The jubilee celebration should confirm
the Christians of today in their faith in God who has revealed himself in
Christ, sustain their hope which reaches out in expectation of eternal life
and rekindle their charity in active service to their brothers and sisters.

<p>During the first stage (1994 to 1996) the Holy See, through a special
committee established for this purpose, will suggest courses of reflection
and action at the universal level. A similar commitment to promoting
awareness will be carried out in a more detailed way by corresponding
commissions in the local churches. In a way, it is a question of continuing
what was done in the period of remote preparation and at the same time of
coming to a deeper appreciation of the most significant aspects of the
jubilee celebration.

<p>32. A jubilee is always an occasion of special grace, "a day blessed by the
Lord." As has already been noted, it is thus a time of joy. The Jubilee of
the Year 2000 is meant to be a great prayer of praise and thanksgiving,
especially for the gift of the incarnation of the Son of God and of the
redemption which he accomplished. In the jubilee year Christians will stand
with the renewed wonder of faith before the love of the Father, who gave
his Son, "that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal
life" (Jn. 3:16). With a profound sense of commitment, they will likewise
express their gratitude for the gift of the Church, established by Christ
as "a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate union with God, and of the
unity of all mankind."[14] Their thanksgiving will embrace the fruits of
holiness which have matured in the life of all those many men and women who
in every generation and every period of history have fully welcomed the
gift of redemption.

<p>Nevertheless, the joy of every jubilee is above all a joy based upon the
forgiveness of sins, the joy of conversion. It therefore seems appropriate
to emphasize once more the theme of the Synod of Bishops in 1983: penance
and reconciliation.[15] That synod was an event of extraordinary significance
in the life of the post-conciliar Church. It took up the ever topical
question of conversion (<i>metanoia</i>), which is the pre-condition for
reconciliation with God on the part of both individuals and communities.

<p>33. Hence it is appropriate that as the second millennium of Christianity
draws to a close the Church should become more fully conscious of the
sinfulness of her children, recalling all those times in history when they
departed from the spirit of Christ and his Gospel and, instead of offering
to the world the witness of a life inspired by the values of faith,
indulged in ways of thinking and acting which were truly forms of
counterwitness and scandal.

<p>Although she is holy because of her incorporation into Christ, the Church
does not tire of doing penance: Before God and man she always acknowledges
as her own her sinful sons and daughters. As Lumen Gentium affirms: "The
Church, embracing sinners to her bosom, is at the same time holy and always
in need of being purified, and incessantly pursues the path of penance and
renewal."[16]

<p>The holy door of the Jubilee of the Year 2000 should be symbolically wider
than those of previous jubilees, because humanity, upon reaching this goal,
will leave behind not just a century but a millennium. It is fitting that
the Church should make this passage with a clear awareness of what has
happened to her during the last 10 centuries. She cannot cross the
threshold of the new millennium without encouraging her children to purify
themselves, through repentance, of past errors and instances of infidelity,
inconsistency and slowness to act. Acknowledging the weaknesses of the past
is an act of honesty and courage which helps us to strengthen our faith,
which alerts us to face today's temptations and challenges, and prepares us
to meet them.

<p>34. Among the sins which require a greater commitment to repentance and
conversion should certainly be counted those which have been detrimental to
the unity willed by God for his people. In the course of the 1,000 years
now drawing to a close, even more than in the first millennium, ecclesial
communion has been painfully wounded, a fact "for which, at times, men of
both sides were to blame."[17] Such wounds openly contradict the will of
Christ and are a cause of scandal to the world.[18] These sins of the past
unfortunately still burden us and remain ever present temptations. It is
necessary to make amends for them, and earnestly to beseech Christ's
forgiveness.

<p>In these last years of the millennium, the Church should invoke the Holy
Spirit with ever greater insistence, imploring from him the grace of
Christian unity. This is a crucial matter for our testimony to the Gospel
before the world. Especially since the Second Vatican Council many
ecumenical initiatives have been undertaken with generosity and commitment:
It can be said that the whole activity of the local churches and of the
Apostolic See has taken on an ecumenical dimension in recent years. The
Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity has become an
important catalyst in the movement toward full unity.

<p>We are all, however, aware that the attainment of this goal cannot be the
fruit of human efforts alone, vital though they are. Unity, after all, is a
gift of the Holy Spirit. We are asked to respond to this gift responsibly,
without compromise in our witness to the truth, generously implementing the
guidelines laid down by the council and in subsequent documents of the Holy
See, which are also highly regarded by many Christians not in full
communion with the Catholic Church.

<p>This then is one of the tasks of Christians as we make our way to the year
2000. The approaching end of the second millennium demands of everyone an
examination of conscience and the promotion of fitting ecumenical
initiatives so that we can celebrate the Great Jubilee, if not completely
united, at least much closer to overcoming the divisions of the second
millennium. As everyone recognizes, an enormous effort is needed in this
regard. It is essential not only to continue along the path of dialogue on
doctrinal matters, but above all to be more committed to prayer for
Christian unity. Such prayer has become much more intense after the
council, but it must increase still more, involving an ever greater number
of Christians, in unison with the great petition of Christ before his
passion: "Father... that they also may all be one in us" (Jn. 17:21).

<p>35. Another painful chapter of history to which the sons and daughters of
the Church must return with a spirit of repentance is that of the
acquiescence given, especially in certain centuries, to intolerance and
even the use of violence in the service of truth.

<p>It is true that an accurate historical judgment cannot prescind from
careful study of the cultural conditioning of the times, as a result of
which many people may have held in good faith that an authentic witness to
the truth could include suppressing the opinions of others or at least
paying no attention to them. Many factors frequently converged to create
assumptions which justified intolerance and fostered an emotional climate
from which only great spirits, truly free and filled with God, were in some
way able to break free. Yet the consideration of mitigating factors does
not exonerate the Church from the obligation to express profound regret for
the weaknesses of so many of her sons and daughters who sullied her face,
preventing her from fully mirroring the image of her crucified Lord, the
supreme witness of patient love and of humble meekness. From these painful
moments of the past a lesson can be drawn for the future, leading all
Christians to adhere fully to the sublime principle stated by the council:
"The truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its own truth, as it
wins over the mind with both gentleness and power."[19]

<p>36. Many cardinals and bishops expressed the desire for a serious
examination of conscience above all on the part of the Church of today. On
the threshold of the new millennium Christians need to place themselves
humbly before the Lord and examine themselves on the responsibility which
they too have for the evils of our day. The present age in fact, together
with much light, also presents not a few shadows.

<p>How can we remain silent, for example, about the religious indifference
which causes many people today to live as if God did not exist or to be
content with a vague religiosity, incapable of coming to grips with the
question of truth and the requirement of consistency? To this must also be
added the widespread loss of the transcendent sense of human life and
confusion in the ethical sphere, even about the fundamental values of
respect for life and the family. The sons and daughters of the Church, too,
need to examine themselves in this regard. To what extent have they been
shaped by the climate of secularism and ethical relativism? And what
responsibility do they bear, in view of the increasing lack of religion,
for not having shown the true face of God, by having "failed in their
religious, moral or social life"?[20]

<p>It cannot be denied that for many Christians the spiritual life is passing
through a time of uncertainty which affects not only their moral life but
also their life of prayer and the theological correctness of their faith.
Faith, already put to the test by the challenges of our times, is sometimes
disoriented by erroneous theological views, the spread of which is abetted
by the crisis of obedience vis-a-vis the Church's magisterium.

<p>And with respect to the Church of our time, how can we not lament the lack
of discernment, which at times became even acquiescence, shown by many
Christians concerning the violation of fundamental human rights by
totalitarian regimes? And should we not also regret, among the shadows of
our own day, the responsibility shared by so many Christians for grave
forms of injustice and exclusion? It must be asked how many Christians
really know and put into practice the principles of the Church's social
doctrine.

<p>An examination of conscience must also consider the reception given to the
council, this great gift of the Spirit to the Church at the end of the
second millennium. To what extent has the word of God become more fully the
soul of theology and the inspiration of the whole of Christian living, as
<i>Dei Verbum</i> sought? Is the liturgy lived as the "origin and summit" of
ecclesial life, in accordance with the teaching of <i>Sacrosanctum
Concilium</i>? In the universal Church and in the particular churches, is the
ecclesiology of communion described in <i>Lumen Gentium</i> being strengthened?
Does it leave room for charisms, ministries and different forms of
participation by the people of God, without adopting notions borrowed from
democracy and sociology which do not reflect the Catholic vision of the
Church and the authentic spirit of Vatican II? Another serious question is
raised by the nature of relations between the Church and the world. The
council's guidelines-set forth in <i>Gaudium et Spes</i> and other documents--
of open, respectful and cordial dialogue, yet accompanied by careful
discernment and courageous witness to the truth, remain valid and call us
to a greater commitment.

<p>37. The Church of the first millennium was born of the blood of the
martyrs: "<i>Sanguis martyrum - semen christianorum.</i>"[21] The historical
events linked to the figure of Constantine the Great could never have
ensured the development of the Church as it occurred during the first
millennium if it had not been for the seeds sown by the martyrs and the
heritage of sanctity which marked the first Christian generations. At the
end of the second millennium, the Church has once again become a Church of
martyrs. The persecutions of believers - priests, religious and laity - has
caused a great sowing of martyrdom in different parts of the world. The
witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a common
inheritance of Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans and Protestants, as Pope Paul
VI pointed out in his homily for the canonization of the Ugandan martyrs.[22]

<p>This witness must not be forgotten. The Church of the first centuries,
although facing considerable organizational difficulties, took care to
write down in special martyrologies the witness of the martyrs. These
martyrologies have been constantly updated through the centuries, and the
register of the saints and the blessed bears the names not only of those
who have shed their blood for Christ but also of teachers of the faith,
missionaries, confessors, bishops, priests, virgins, married couples,
widows and children.

<p>In our own century the martyrs have returned, many of them nameless,
"unknown soldiers" as it were of God's great cause. As far as possible,
their witness should not be lost to the Church. As was recommended in the
consistory, the local churches should do everything possible to ensure that
the memory of those who have suffered martyrdom should be safeguarded,
gathering the necessary documentation. This gesture cannot fail to have an
ecumenical character and expression. Perhaps the most convincing form of
ecumenism is the ecumenism of the saints and of the martyrs. The <i>communio
sanctorum</i> speaks louder than the things which divide us. The martyrologium
of the first centuries was the basis of the veneration of the saints. By
proclaiming and venerating the holiness of her sons and daughters, the
church gave supreme honor to God himself; in the martyrs she venerated
Christ, who was at the origin of their martyrdom and of their holiness. In
later times there developed the practice of canonization, a practice which
still continues in the Catholic Church and in the Orthodox churches. In
recent years the number of canonizations and beatifications has increased.
These show the vitality of the local churches, which are much more numerous
today than in the first centuries and in the first millennium. The greatest
homage which all the Churches can give to Christ on the threshold of the
third millennium will be to manifest the redeemer's all-powerful presence
through the fruits of faith, hope and charity present in men and women of
many different tongues and races who have followed Christ in the various
forms of the Christian vocation.

<p>It will be the task of the Apostolic See, in preparation for the year 2000,
to update the martyrologies for the universal church, paying careful
attention to the holiness of those who in our own time lived fully by the
truth of Christ. In particular, there is a need to foster the recognition
of the heroic virtues of men and women who have lived their Christian
vocation in marriage. Precisely because we are convinced of the abundant
fruits of holiness in the married state, we need to find the most
appropriate means for discerning them and proposing them to the whole
church as a model and encouragement for other Christian spouses.

<p>38. A further need emphasized by the cardinals and bishops is that of
continental synods, following the example of those already held for Europe
and Africa. The last General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate
accepted, in agreement with the bishops of North America, the proposal for
a Synod for the Americas on the problems of the new evangelization in both
parts of the same continent, so different in origin and history, and on
issues of justice and of international economic relations in view of the
enormous gap between North and South.

<p>Another plan for a continent-wide synod will concern Asia, where the issue
of the encounter of Christianity with ancient local cultures and religions
is a pressing one. This is a great challenge for evangelization, since
religious systems such as Buddhism or Hinduism have a clearly
soteriological character. There is also an urgent need for a synod on the
occasion of the Great Jubilee in order to illustrate and explain more fully
the truth that Christ is the one mediator between God and man and the sole
redeemer of the world, to be clearly distinguished from the founders of
other great religions. With sincere esteem, the Church regards the elements
of truth found in those religions as a reflection of the truth which
enlightens all men and women.[23] "<i>Ecce natus est nobis Salvator mundi</i>": In
the year 2000 the proclamation of this truth should resound with renewed
power.

<p>Also for Oceania a regional synod could be useful. In this region there
arises the question, among others, of the aboriginal people, who in a
unique way evoke aspects of human prehistory. In this synod a matter not to
be overlooked, together with other problems of the region, would be the
encounter of Christianity with the most ancient forms of religion,
profoundly marked by a monotheistic orientation.

<p><b>B. Second Phase</b>

<p>39. On the basis of this vast program aimed at creating awareness, it will
then be possible to begin the second phase, the strictly preparatory phase.
This will take place over the span of three years, from 1997 to 1999. The
thematic structure of this three-year period, centered on Christ, the Son
of God made man, must necessarily be theological, and therefore
Trinitarian.

<p><i>Year 1: Jesus Christ</i>

<p>40. The first year, 1997, will thus be devoted to reflection on Christ, the
Word of God, made man by the power of the Holy Spirit. The distinctly
Christological character of the jubilee needs to be emphasized, for it will
celebrate the incarnation and coming into the world of the Son of God, the
mystery of salvation for all mankind. The general theme proposed by many
cardinals and bishops for this year is: "Jesus Christ, the one savior of
the world, yesterday, today and forever" (cf. Heb. 13:8).

<p>Among the Christological themes suggested in the consistory the following
stand out: a renewed appreciation of Christ, savior and proclaimer of the
Gospel, with special reference to the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Luke
where the theme of Christ's mission of preaching the good news and the
theme of the jubilee arc woven; a deeper standing of the mystery of the
incarnation and of Jesus' birth from the Virgin Mary; the necessity of
faith in Christ for salvation. In order to recognize who Christ truly is,
Christians, especially in the course of this year, should turn with renewed
interest to the Bible, "whether it be through the liturgy, rich in the
divine word, or through devotional reading, or through instructions
suitable for the purpose and other aids."[24] In the revealed text it is the
heavenly Father himself who comes to us in love and who dwells with us,
disclosing to us the nature of his only-begotten Son and his plan of
salvation for humanity.[25]

<p>41. The commitment, mentioned earlier, to make the mystery of salvation
sacramentally present can lead, in the course of the year, to a renewed
appreciation of baptism as the basis of Christian living, according to the
words of the apostle: "As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put
on Christ" (Gal. 3:27). The Catechism of the Catholic Church, for its part,
recalls that baptism constitutes "the foundation of communion among all
Christians, including those who are not yet in full communion with the
Catholic Church."[26] From an ecumenical point of view, this will certainly
be a very important year for Christians to look together to Christ the one
Lord, deepening our commitment to become one in him in accordance with his
prayer to the Father. This emphasis on the centrality of Christ, of the
word of God and of faith ought to inspire interest among Christians of
other denominations and meet with a favorable response from them.

<p>42. Everything ought to focus on the primary objective of the jubilee: the
strengthening of faith and of the witness of Christians. It is therefore
necessary to inspire in all the faithful a true longing for holiness, a
deep desire for conversion and personal renewal in a context of ever more
intense prayer and of solidarity with one's neighbor, especially the most
needy.

<p>The first year therefore will be the opportune moment for a renewed
appreciation of catechesis in its original meaning as "the apostles'
teaching" (Acts 2:42) about the person of Jesus Christ and his mystery of
salvation. In this regard, a detailed study of the Catechism of the
Catholic Church will prove of great benefit, for the catechism presents
"faithfully and systematically ... the teaching of sacred Scripture, the
living tradition of the Church and the authentic magisterium, as well as
the spiritual heritage of the fathers, doctors and saints of the Church, to
allow for a better knowledge of the Christian mystery and for enlivening
the faith of the people of God."[27] To be realistic we need to enlighten the
consciences of the faithful concerning errors regarding the person of
Christ, clarifying objections against him and against the Church.

<p>43. The Blessed Virgin, who will be as it were "indirectly" present in the
whole preparatory phase, will be contemplated in this first year especially
in the mystery of her divine motherhood. It was in her womb that the Word
became flesh! The affirmation of the central place of Christ cannot
therefore be separated from the recognition of the role played by his most
holy mother. Veneration of her, when properly understood, can in no way
take away from "the dignity and efficacy of Christ the one mediator."[28]
Mary, in fact, constantly points to her divine son and she is proposed to
all believers as the model of faith which is put into practice.

<p>"Devotedly meditating on her and contemplating her in the light of the Word
made man, the Church with reverence enters more intimately into the supreme
mystery of the incarnation and becomes ever increasingly like her
spouse."[29]

<p><i>Year 2: The Holy Spirit</i>

<p>44. 1998, the second year of the preparatory phase, will be dedicated in a
particular way to the Holy Spirit and to his sanctifying presence within
the community of Christ's disciples. "The great jubilee at the close of the
second millennium...," I wrote in the encyclical <i>Dominum et Vivificantem</i>,
"has a pneumatological aspect since the mystery of the incarnation was
accomplished 'by the power of the Holy Spirit.' It was 'brought about' by
that Spirit-consubstantial with the Father and the Son-who, in the absolute
mystery of the triune God, is the person-love, the uncreated gift, who is
the eternal source of every gift that comes from God in the order of
creation, the direct principle and, in a certain sense, the subject of
God's self-communication in the order of grace. The mystery of the
incarnation constitutes the climax of this giving, this divine self-
communication."[30]

<p>The Church cannot prepare for the new millennium "in any other way than in
the Holy Spirit. What was accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit 'in
the fullness of time' can only through the Spirit's power now emerge from
the memory of the Church."[31]

<p>The Spirit, in fact, makes present in the Church of every time and place
the unique revelation brought by Christ to humanity, making it alive and
active in the soul of each individual: "The counselor, the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and
bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you" (Jn. 14:26).

<p>45. The primary tasks of the preparation for the jubilee thus include a
renewed appreciation of the presence and activity of the Spirit, who acts
within the Church both in the sacraments, especially in confirmation, and
in the variety of charisms, roles and ministries which he inspires for the
good of the Church: There is only one Spirit who, according to his own
richness and the needs of the ministries, distributes his different gifts
for the welfare of the Church (cf. 1 Cor 12:1-11). Among these gifts stands
out the grace given to the apostles. To their authority, the Spirit himself
subjected even those who were endowed with charisms (cf. 1 Cor. 14). Giving
the body unity through himself, and through his power, and through the
internal cohesion of its members, this same Spirit produces and urges love
among the believers."[32]

<p>In our own day too, the Spirit is the principal agent of the new
evangelization. Hence it will be important to gain a renewed appreciation
of the Spirit as the one who builds the kingdom of God within the course of
history and prepares its full manifestation in Jesus Christ, stirring
people's hearts and quickening in our world the seeds of the full salvation
which will come at the end of time.

<p>46. In this eschatological perspective, believers should be called to a
renewed appreciation of the theological virtue of hope, which they have
already heard proclaimed "in the word of the truth, the Gospel" (Col 1:5).
The basic attitude of hope, on the one hand, encourages the Christian not
to lose sight of the final goal which gives meaning and value to life, and
on the other offers solid and profound reasons for a daily commitment to
transform reality in order to make it correspond to God's plan.

<p>As the apostle Paul reminds us: "We know that the whole creation has been
groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation, but we
ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we
wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope
we were saved" (Rom. 8:22-24). Christians are called to prepare for the
Great Jubilee of the beginning of the third millennium by renewing their
hope in the definitive coming of the kingdom of God, preparing for it daily
in their hearts, in the Christian community to which they belong, in their
particular social context and in world history itself.

<p>There is also need for a better appreciation and understanding of the signs
of hope present in the last part of this century, even though they often
remain hidden from our eyes. In society in general, such signs of hope
include: scientific, technological and especially medical progress in the
service of human life, a greater awareness of our responsibility for the
environment, efforts to restore peace and justice wherever they have been
violated, a desire for reconciliation and solidarity among different
peoples, particularly in the complex relationship between the North and the
South of the world. In the Church they include a greater attention to the
voice of the Spirit through the acceptance of charisms and the promotion of
the laity, a deeper commitment to the cause of Christian unity and the
increased interest in dialogue with other religions and with contemporary
culture.

<p>47. The reflection of the faithful in the second year of preparation ought
to focus particularly on the value of unity within the Church, to which the
various gifts and charisms bestowed upon her by the Spirit are directed. In
this regard, it will be opportune to promote a deeper understanding of the
ecclesiological doctrine of the Second Vatican Council as contained
primarily in the dogmatic constitution Lumen Gentium. This important
document has expressly emphasized that the unity of the body of Christ is
founded on the activity of the Spirit, guaranteed by the apostolic ministry
and sustained by mutual love (cf. 1 Cor. 13:1-8). This catechetical
enrichment of the faith cannot fail to bring the members of the people of
God to a more mature awareness of their own responsibilities, as well as to
a more lively sense of the importance of ecclesial obedience.[33]

<p>48. Mary, who conceived the incarnate Word by the power of the Holy Spirit
and then in the whole of her life allowed herself to be guided by his
interior activity, will be contemplated and imitated during this year above
all as the woman who was docile to the voice of the Spirit, a woman of
silence and attentiveness, a woman of hope who, like Abraham, accepted
God's will "hoping against hope" (cf. Rom. 4:18). Mary gave full expression
to the longing of the poor of Yahweh and is a radiant model for those who
entrust themselves with all their hearts to the promises of God.

<p><i>Year 3: God the Father</i>

<p>49. 1999, the third and final year of preparation, will be aimed at
broadening the horizons of believers so that they will see things in the
perspective of Christ: in the perspective of the "Father who is in heaven"
(cf. Mt. 5:45), from whom the Lord was sent and to whom he has returned
(cf. Jn. 16:28).

<p>"This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom you have sent" (Jn. 17:3). The whole of the Christian life is
like a great pilgrimage to the house of the Father, whose unconditional
love for every human creature, and in particular for the "prodigal son"
(cf. Lk. 15: 11-32), we discover anew each day. This pilgrimage takes place
in the heart of each person, extends to the believing community and then
reaches to the whole of humanity.

<p>The jubilee, centered on the person of Christ, thus becomes a great act of
praise to the Father: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the
heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Eph. 1:3-4).

<p>50. In this third year the sense of being on a "journey to the Father"
should encourage everyone to undertake, by holding fast to Christ the
redeemer of man, a journey of authentic conversion. This includes both a
"negative" aspect, that of liberation from sin, and a "positive" aspect,
that of choosing good, accepting the ethical values expressed in the
natural law, which is confirmed and deepened by the Gospel. This is the
proper context for a renewed appreciation and more intense celebration of
the sacrament of penance in its most profound meaning. The call to
conversion as the indispensable condition of Christian love is particularly
important in contemporary society, where the very foundations of an
ethically correct vision of human existence often seem to have been lost.

<p>It will therefore be necessary, especially during this year, to emphasize
the theological virtue of charity, recalling the significant and lapidary
words of the First Letter of John: "God is love" (4:8, 16). Charity, in its
twofold reality as love of God and neighbor, is the summing up of the moral
life of the believer. It has in God its source and its goal.

<p>51. From this point of view, if we recall that Jesus came to "preach the
good news to the poor" (Mt. 11:5; Lk. 7:22), how can we fail to lay greater
emphasis on the Church's preferential option for the poor and the outcast?
Indeed, it has to be said that a commitment to justice and peace in a world
like ours, marked by so many conflicts and intolerable social and economic
inequalities, is a necessary condition for the preparation and celebration
of the jubilee. Thus, in the spirit of the Book of Leviticus (25:8-12),
Christians will have to raise their voice on behalf of all the poor of the
world, proposing the jubilee as an appropriate time to give thought, among
other things, to reducing substantially, if not canceling outright, the
international debt which seriously threatens the future of many nations.
The jubilee can also offer an opportunity for reflecting on other
challenges of our time, such as the difficulties of dialogue between
different cultures and the problems connected with respect for women's
rights and the promotion of the family and marriage.

<p>52. Recalling that "Christ ... by the revelation of the mystery of the
Father and his love fully reveals man to man himself and makes his supreme
calling clear,"[34] two commitments should characterize in a special way the
third preparatory year: meeting the challenge of secularism and dialogue
with the great religions.

<p>With regard to the former, it will be fitting to broach the vast subject of
the crisis of civilization, which has become apparent especially in the
West, which is highly developed from the standpoint of technology but is
interiorly impoverished by its tendency to forget God or to keep him at a
distance. This crisis of civilization must be countered by the civilization
of love, founded on the universal values of peace, solidarity, justice and
liberty, which find their full attainment in Christ.

<p>53. On the other hand, as far as the field of religious awareness is
concerned, the eve of the year 2000 will provide a great opportunity,
especially in view of the events of recent decades, for interreligious
dialogue, in accordance with the specific guidelines set down by the Second
Vatican Council in its declaration <i>Nostra Aetate</i> on the relationship of
the Church to non-Christian religions.

<p>In this dialogue the Jews and the Muslims ought to have a pre-eminent
place. God grant that as a confirmation of these intentions it may also be
possible to hold joint meetings in places of significance for the great
monotheistic religions.

<p>In this regard attention is being given to finding ways of arranging
historic meetings in places of exceptional symbolic importance like
Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Mount Sinai as a means of furthering dialogue with
Jews and the followers of Islam, and to arranging similar meetings
elsewhere with the leaders of the great world religions. However, care will
always have be taken not to cause harmful misunderstandings, avoiding the
risk of syncretism and of a facile and deceptive irenicism.

<p>54. In this broad perspective of commitments, Mary most holy, the highly
favored daughter of the Father, will appear before the eyes of believers as
the perfect model of love toward both God and neighbor. As she herself says
in the canticle of the "Magnificat," great things were done for her by the
Almighty, whose name is holy (cf. Lk. 1:49). The Father chose her for a
unique mission in the history of salvation: that of being the mother of the
long-awaited savior. The Virgin Mary responded to God's call with complete
openness: "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord" (Lk. 1:38). Her
motherhood, which began in Nazareth and was lived most intensely in
Jerusalem at the foot of the cross, will be felt during this year as a
loving and urgent invitation addressed to all the children of God so that
they will return to the house of the Father when they hear her maternal
voice: "Do whatever Christ tells you" (cf. Jn. 2:5).

<p><b>C. Approaching the Celebration</b>

<p>55. A separate chapter will be the actual celebration of the Great Jubilee,
which will take place simultaneously in the Holy Land, in Rome and in the
local churches throughout the world. Especially in this phase, the phase of
celebration, the aim will be to give glory to the Trinity, from whom
everything in the world and in history comes and to whom everything
returns. This mystery is the focus of the three years of immediate
preparation: from Christ and through Christ, in the Holy Spirit, to the
Father. In this sense the jubilee celebration makes present in an
anticipatory way the goal and fulfillment of the life of each Christian and
of the whole church in the triune God.

<p>But since Christ is the only way to the Father, in order to highlight his
living and saving presence in the Church and the world the International
Eucharistic Congress will take place in Rome on the occasion of the Great
Jubilee. The year 2000 will be intensely eucharistic: in the sacrament of
the eucharist the savior, who took flesh in Mary's womb 20 centuries ago,
continues to offer himself to humanity as the source of divine life.

<p>The ecumenical and universal character of the sacred jubilee can be
fittingly reflected by a meeting of all Christians. This would be an event
of great significance, and so, in order to avoid misunderstandings, it
should be properly presented and carefully prepared in an attitude of
fraternal cooperation with Christians of other denominations and
traditions, as well as of grateful openness to those religions whose
representatives might wish to acknowledge the joy shared by all the
disciples of Christ.

<p>One thing is certain: Everyone is asked to do as much as possible to ensure
that the great challenge of the year 2000 is not overlooked, for this
challenge certainly involves a special grace of the Lord for the Church and
for the whole of humanity.

<p align=center><b>V. "JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME . . . FOREVER" (HEBREWS 13:8)</b></p>

<p>56. The Church has endured for 2,000 years. Like the mustard seed in the
Gospel, she has grown and become a great tree, able to cover the whole of
humanity with her branches (cf. Mt. 13:31-32). The Second Vatican Council,
in its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, thus addresses the question of
membership in the Church and the call of all people to belong to the people
of God: "All are called to be part of this Catholic unity of the new people
of God . . . . And there belong to it or are related to it in various ways the
Catholic faithful as well as all who believe in Christ, and indeed the
whole of mankind, which by the grace of God is called to salvation."[35] Pope
Paul VI, in the encyclical <i>Ecclesiam Suam</i>, illustrates how all mankind is
involved in the plan of God and emphasizes the various circles of the
dialogue of salvation.[36]

<p>Continuing this approach, we can also appreciate more clearly the Gospel
parable of the leaven (cf. Mt. 13:33): Christ, like a divine leaven, always
and ever more fully penetrates the life of humanity, spreading the work of
salvation accomplished in the paschal mystery. What is more, he embraces
within his redemptive power the whole past history of the human race,
beginning with the first Adam.[37] The future also belongs to him: "Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Heb. 13:8). For her
part the Church "seeks but a solitary goal: to carry forward the work of
Christ himself under the lead of the Holy Spirit, the paraclete. And Christ
entered this world to give witness to the truth, to rescue and not to sit
in judgment, to serve and not to be served."[38]

<p>57. Therefore, ever since the apostolic age the Church's mission has
continued without interruption within the whole human family. The first
evangelization took place above all in the region of the Mediterranean. In
the course of the first millennium, missions setting out from Rome and
Constantinople brought Christianity to the whole continent of Europe. At
the same time they made their way to the heart of Asia, as far as India and
China. The end of the 15th century marked both the discovery of America and
the beginning of the evangelization of that great continent, North and
South.

<p>Simultaneously, while the sub-Saharan coasts of Africa welcomed the light
of Christ, St. Francis Xavier, patron of the missions, reached Japan. At
the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, several lay men
brought Christianity to Korea. In the same period the proclamation of the
Gospel reached Indochina, as well as Australia and the islands of the
Pacific.

<p>The 19th century witnessed vast missionary activity among the peoples of
Africa. All these efforts bore fruit which has lasted up to the present
day. The Second Vatican Council gives an account of this in the decree <i>Ad
Gentes</i> on missionary activity. After the council the question of
missionary work was dealt with in the encyclical <i>Redemptoris Missio</i>, in
the light of the problems of the missions in these final years of our
century. In the future, too, the Church must continue to be missionary:
Indeed missionary outreach is part of her very nature. With the fall of the
great anti-Christian systems in Europe, first of nazism and then of
communism, there is urgent need to bring once more the liberating message
of the Gospel to the men and women of Europe.[39] Furthermore, as the
encyclical <i>Redemptoris Missio</i> affirms, the modern world reflects the
situation of the Areopagus of Athens, where St. Paul spoke.[40] Today there
are many <i>areopagi</i>, and very different ones: These are the vast sectors of
contemporary civilization and culture, of politics and economics. The more
the West is becoming estranged from its Christian roots, the more it is
becoming missionary territory, taking the form of many different
<i>areopagi</i>.

<p>58. The future of the world and the Church belongs to the younger
generation, to those who born in this century will reach maturity in the
next, the first century of the new millennium. Christ expects great things
from young people, as he did from the young man who asked him: "What good
deed must I do to have eternal life?" (Mt. 19:16). I have referred to the
remarkable answer which Jesus gave to him in the recent encyclical
Veritatis Splendor, as I did earlier, in 1985, in my apostolic letter to
the youth of the world. Young people, in every situation, in every region
of the world, do not cease to put questions to Christ: They meet him and
they keep searching for him in order to question him further. If they
succeed in following the road which he points out to them, they will have
the joy of making their own contribution to his presence in the next
century and in the centuries to come, until the end of time: "Jesus is the
same yesterday, today and forever."

<p>59. In conclusion, it is helpful to recall the words of the pastoral
constitution Gaudium et Spes: "The Church believes that Christ, who died
and was raised up for all, can through his Spirit offer man the light and
the strength to measure up to his supreme destiny. Nor has any other name
under heaven been given to man by which it is fitting for him to be saved.
She likewise holds that in her most benign Lord and master can be found the
key, the focal point and the goal of all human history. The Church also
maintains that beneath all changes there are so many realities which do not
change and which have their ultimate foundation in Christ, who is the same
yesterday and today and forever. Hence in the light of Christ, the image of
the unseen God, the firstborn of every creature, the council wishes to
speak to all men in order to illuminate the mystery of man and to cooperate
in finding the solution to the outstanding problems of our time."[41]

<p>While I invite the faithful to raise to the Lord fervent prayers to obtain
the light and assistance necessary for the preparation and celebration of
the forthcoming jubilee, I exhort my venerable brothers in the episcopate
and the ecclesial communities entrusted to them to open their hearts to the
promptings of the Spirit. He will not fail to arouse enthusiasm and lead
people to celebrate the jubilee with renewed faith and generous
participation.

<p>I entrust this responsibility of the whole church to the maternal
intercession of Mary, mother of the redeemer. She, the mother of fairest
love, will be for Christians on the way to the Great Jubilee of the third
millennium the star which safely guides their steps to the Lord. May the
unassuming young woman of Nazareth, who 2,000 years ago offered to the
world the incarnate Word, lead the men and women of the new millennium
toward the one who is the true light that enlightens every man" (Jn. 1:9).

<p>With these sentiments I impart to all my blessing.

<p>From the Vatican, on Nov. 10 in the year 1994, the 17th of my pontificate.
