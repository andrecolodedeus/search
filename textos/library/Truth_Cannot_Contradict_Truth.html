<h1>Truth Cannot Contradict Truth</h1>  
<p><b>Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (October 22, 1996)</b>

<p>WITH GREAT PLEASURE I address cordial greeting to you, Mr. President, and to
all of you who constitute the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, on the
occasion of your plenary assembly. I offer my best wishes in particular to
the new academicians, who have come to take part in your work for the first
time. I would also like to remember the academicians who died during the
past year, whom I commend to the
<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord of life</a>.

<p>1. In celebrating the 60th anniversary of the academy's refoundation, I
would like to recall the intentions of my predecessor Pius XI, who wished to
surround himself with a select group of scholars, relying on them to inform
the Holy See in complete freedom about developments in scientific research,
and thereby to assist him in his reflections.

<p>He asked those whom he called the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> "senatus scientificus" to serve
the
<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I again extend this same invitation to you today, certain that we
will be able to profit from the fruitfulness of a trustful dialogue between
the Church and science (cf. Address to the Academy of Sciences, No. 1, Oct.
28, 1986; <i>L'Osservatore Romano, Eng. ed.</i>, Nov. 24, 1986, p. 22).

<p>2. I am pleased with the first theme you have chosen, that of the origins of
life and evolution, an essential subject which deeply interests the
<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,
since
<a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, for its part, contains teaching concerning the nature and
origins of man. How do the conclusions reached by the various scientific
disciplines coincide with those contained in the message of revelation? And
if, at first sight, there are apparent contradictions, in what direction do
we look for their solution? We know, in fact, that truth cannot contradict
truth (cf. Leo XIII, encyclical <i>Providentissimus Deus</i>). Moreover, to shed
greater light on historical truth, your research on the Church's relations
with science between the 16th and 18th centuries is of great importance.
During this plenary session, you are undertaking a "reflection on science at
the dawn of the third millennium," starting with the identification of the
principal problems created by the sciences and which affect humanity's
future. With this step you point the way to solutions which will be
beneficial to the whole human community. In the domain of inanimate and
animate nature, the evolution of science and its applications give rise to
new questions. The better the Church's knowledge is of their essential
aspects, the more she will understand their impact. Consequently, in
accordance with her specific mission she will be able to offer criteria for
discerning the moral conduct required of all human beings in view of their
integral
<a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>3. Before offering you several reflections that more specifically concern
the subject of the origin of life and its evolution, I would like to remind
you that the
<a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">magisterium</a>
of the Church has already made pronouncements on
these matters within the framework of her own competence. I will cite here
two interventions.

<p>In his encyclical
<a href="../docs/pi12hg.htm"><i>Humani Generis</i></a> (1950),
my predecessor Pius XII had
already stated that there was no opposition between evolution and the
doctrine of the faith about man and his vocation, on condition that one did
not lose sight of several indisputable points.

<p>For my part, when I received those taking part in your academy's plenary
assembly on October 31, 1992, I had the opportunity with regard to
<a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> to
draw attention to the need of a rigorous
<a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutic</a>
for the correct
interpretation of the inspired word. It is necessary to determine the proper
sense of Scripture, while avoiding any unwarranted interpretations that make
it say what it does not intend to say. In order to delineate the field of
their own study, the exegete and the theologian must keep informed about the
results achieved by the natural sciences (cf. AAS 85 1/81993 3/8, pp.
764-772; address to the Pontifical Biblical Commission, April 23, 1993,
announcing the document on the <i>The Interpretation of the Bible in the
Church</i>: AAS 86 1/81994 3/8, pp. 232-243).

<p>4. Taking into account the state of scientific research at the time as well
as of the requirements of theology, the encyclical <i>Humani Generis</i>
considered the doctrine of "evolutionism" a serious hypothesis, worthy of
investigation and in-depth study equal to that of the opposing hypothesis.
Pius XII added two methodological conditions: that this opinion should not
be adopted as though it were a certain, proven doctrine and as though one
could totally prescind from revelation with regard to the questions it
raises. He also spelled out the condition on which this opinion would be
compatible with the Christian faith, a point to which I will return.
Today, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical, new
knowledge has led to the recognition of
the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis.

[<i>Aujourdhui, pr&egrave;s dun demi-si&egrave;cle apr&egrave;s la parution de
l'encyclique, de nouvelles connaissances conduisent &agrave; reconnaitre
dans la th&eacute;orie de l'&eacute;volution plus qu'une hypoth&egrave;se.</i>]

It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been
progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in
various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated,
of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a
significant argument in favor of this theory.

<p>What is the significance of such a theory? To address this question is to
enter the field of
<a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a>.
A theory is a metascientific elaboration,
distinct from the results of observation but consistent with them. By means
of it a series of independent data and facts can be related and interpreted
in a unified explanation. A theory's validity depends on whether or not it
can be verified; it is constantly tested against the facts; wherever it can
no longer explain the latter, it shows its limitations and unsuitability. It
must then be rethought.

<p>Furthermore, while the formulation of a theory like that of evolution
complies with the need for consistency with the observed data, it borrows
certain notions from natural philosophy.

<p>And, to tell the truth, rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak
of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do
with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and
on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based. Hence the
existence of
<a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialist</a>, reductionist and
<a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">spiritualist</a> interpretations.
What is to be decided here is the true role of
<a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and, beyond it, of
theology.

<p>5. The Church's magisterium is directly concerned with the question of
evolution, for it involves the conception of man:
<a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a>
teaches us that
he was created in the image and likeness of God (cf. Gn 1:27-29). The
conciliar constitution
<a href="../docs/ec21gs.htm"><i>Gaudium et Spes</i></a>
has magnificently explained this
doctrine, which is pivotal to Christian thought. It recalled that man is
"the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake" (No. 24).
In other terms, the human individual cannot be subordinated as a pure means
or a pure instrument, either to the species or to society; he has value
<i>per se</i>. He is a person. With his
<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>
and his
<a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, he is capable of
forming a relationship of communion, solidarity and self-giving with his
peers.
<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>
observes that man's likeness to God resides especially in
his speculative intellect, for his relationship with the object of his
knowledge resembles God's relationship with what he has created
<a href="../summa/200305.htm">(Summa Theologica I-II:3:5, ad 1)</a>.
But even more, man is called to enter
into a relationship of knowledge and love with God himself, a relationship
which will find its complete fulfillment beyond
<a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, in
<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. All the
depth and grandeur of this vocation are revealed to us in the mystery of the
<a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen Christ</a> (cf. <i>Gaudium et Spes</i>, 22). It is by virtue of his
<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>
<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the whole person possesses such a dignity even in his body. Pius
XII stressed this essential point: If the human body take its origin from
pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God
("animas enim a Deo immediate creari catholica fides nos retinere iubei";
<a href="../docs/pi12hg.htm#36">"Humani Generis," 36</a>).
Consequently, theories of evolution which, in accordance with the
philosophies inspiring them, consider the
<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> as emerging from the forces
of living matter or as a mere <i>epiphenomenon</i> of this matter, are incompatible
with the truth about man. Nor are they able to ground the dignity of the
person.

<p>6. With man, then, we find ourselves in the presence of an
<a href="../cathen/11258a.htm">ontological</a>
difference, an ontological leap, one could say. However, does not the posing
of such ontological discontinuity run counter to that physical continuity
which seems to be the main thread of research into evolution in the field of
<a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>
and chemistry? Consideration of the method used in the various
branches of knowledge makes it possible to reconcile two points of view
which would seem irreconcilable. The sciences of observation describe and
measure the multiple manifestations of life with increasing precision and
correlate them with the time line. The moment of transition to the
<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>
cannot be the object of this kind of observation, which nevertheless can
discover at the experimental level a series of very valuable signs
indicating what is specific to the human being. But the experience of
metaphysical knowledge, of self-awareness and self-reflection, of
<a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">moral conscience</a>, freedom, or again of aesthetic and religious experience, falls
within the competence of philosophical analysis and reflection, while
theology brings out its ultimate meaning according to the Creator's plans.

<p>7. In conclusion, I would like to call to mind a Gospel truth which can shed
a higher light on the horizon of your research into the origins and
unfolding of living matter. The
<a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a> in fact bears an extraordinary message
of life. It gives us a wise vision of life inasmuch as it describes the
loftiest forms of existence. This vision guided me in the encyclical which I
dedicated to respect for human life, and which I called precisely
"Evangelium Vitae."

<p>It is significant that in St. John's Gospel <i>life</i> refers to the
<a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">divine light</a>
which Christ communicates to us. We are called to enter into
<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>,
that is to say, into the eternity of divine beatitude.
To warn us against the serious
<a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> threatening us,
<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> quotes
the great saying of Deuteronomy: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceeds from the mouth of God" (Dt 8:3; cf. Mt 4:4).
Even more, "life" is one of the most beautiful titles which the Bible
attributes to God. He is the living God.

<p>I cordially invoke an abundance of divine blessings upon you and upon all
who are close to you.
