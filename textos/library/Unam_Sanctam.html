<h1>Unam Sanctam</h1>  

<p><b>His Holiness Pope Boniface VIII</b>
<br><b>November 18, 1302</b>

<p>URGED BY FAITH, we are obliged to believe and to maintain that the
Church is one, holy, catholic, and also apostolic. We believe in her
firmly and we confess with simplicity that outside of her there is
neither salvation nor the remission of sins, as the Spouse in the
Canticles [Sgs 6:8] proclaims: "One is my dove, my perfect one. She is
the only one, the chosen of her who bore her," and she represents one
sole mystical body whose Head is Christ and the head of Christ is God [1
Cor 11:3]. In her then is one Lord, one faith, one baptism [Eph 4:5].
There had been at the time of the deluge only one ark of Noah,
prefiguring the one Church, which ark, having been finished to a single
cubit, had only one pilot and guide, i.e., Noah, and we read that,
outside of this ark, all that subsisted on the earth was destroyed.

<p>We venerate this Church as one, the Lord having said by the mouth of the
prophet: "Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword and my only one from
the hand of the dog." [Ps 21:20] He has prayed for his soul, that is
for himself, heart and body; and this body, that is to say, the Church,
He has called one because of the unity of the Spouse, of the faith, of
the sacraments, and of the charity of the Church. This is the tunic of
the Lord, the seamless tunic, which was not rent but which was cast by
lot [Jn 19:23-24]. Therefore, of the one and only Church there is one
body and one head, not two heads like a monster; that is, Christ and the
Vicar of Christ, Peter and the successor of Peter, since the Lord
speaking to Peter Himself said: "Feed my sheep" [Jn 21:17], meaning, my
sheep in general, not these, nor those in particular, whence we
understand that He entrusted all to him [Peter]. Therefore, if the
Greeks or others should say that they are not confided to Peter and to
his successors, they must confess not bei ng the sheep of Christ, since
Our Lord says in John "there is one sheepfold and one shepherd." We are
informed by the texts of the gospels that in this Church and in its
power are two swords; namely, the spiritual and the temporal. For when
the Apostles say: "Behold, here are two swords" [Lk 22:38] that is to
say, in the Church, since the Apostles were speaking, the Lord did not
reply that there were too many, but sufficient. Certainly the one who
denies that the temporal sword is in the power of Peter has not
listened well to the word of the Lord commanding: "Put up thy sword
into thy scabbard" [Mt 26:52]. Both, therefore, are in the power of the
Church, that is to say, the spiritual and the material sword, but the
former is to be administered <i>for</i> the Church but the latter <i>by</i> the
Church; the former in the hands of the priest; the latter by the hands
of kings and soldiers, but at the will and sufferance of the priest.

<p>However, one sword ought to be subordinated to the other and temporal
authority, subjected to spiritual power. For since the Apostle said:
"There is no power except from God and the things that are, are ordained
of God" [Rom 13:1-2], but they would not be ordained if one sword were
not subordinated to the other and if the inferior one, as it were, were
not led upwards by the other.

<p>For, according to the Blessed Dionysius, it is a law of the divinity
that the lowest things reach the highest place by intermediaries.
Then, according to the order of the universe, all things are not led
back to order equally and immediately, but the lowest by the
intermediary, and the inferior by the superior. Hence we must recognize
the more clearly that spiritual power surpasses in dignity and in
nobility any temporal power whatever, as spiritual things surpass the
temporal. This we see very clearly also by the payment, benediction,
and consecration of the tithes, but the acceptance of power itself and
by the government even of things. For with truth as our witness, it
belongs to spiritual power to establish the terrestrial power and to
pass judgement if it has not been good. Thus is accomplished the
prophecy of Jeremias concerning the Church and the ecclesiastical power:
"Behold today I have placed you over nations, and over kingdoms" and
the rest. Therefore, if the terrestrial power err, it will be judged by
the spiritual power; but if a minor spiritual power err, it will be
judged by a superior spiritual power; but if the highest power of all
err, it can be judged only by God, and not by man, according to the
testimony of the Apostle: "The spiritual man judgeth of all things and
he himself is judged by no man" [1 Cor 2:15]. This authority, however,
(though it has been given to man and is exercised by man), is not human
but rather divine, granted to Peter by a divine word and reaffirmed to
him (Peter) and his successors by the One Whom Peter confessed, the
Lord saying to Peter himself, "Whatsoever you shall bind on earth, shall
be bound also in Heaven" etc., [Mt 16:19]. Therefore whoever resists
this power thus ordained by God, resists the ordinance of God [Rom
13:2], unless he invent like Manicheus two beginnings, which is false
and judged by us heretical, since according to the testimony of Moses,
it is not in the beginnings but in the beginning that God created heaven
and earth [Gen 1:1]. Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define
that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature
be subject to the Roman Pontiff.
