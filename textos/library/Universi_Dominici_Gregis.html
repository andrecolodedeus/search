<h1>Universi Dominici Gregis</h1>  
<p><b>Apostolic Constitution of Pope John Paul II on the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff (22 February, 1996)</b>

<p>JOHN PAUL, BISHOP
<br>SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD
<br>FOR PERPETUAL REMEMBRANCE

<p>The Shepherd of the Lord's whole flock is the Bishop of the Church of Rome,
where the Blessed Apostle Peter, by sovereign disposition of divine Providence,
offered to Christ the supreme witness of martyrdom by the shedding of his blood.
It is therefore understandable that the lawful apostolic succession in this See,
with which &quot;because of its great pre-eminence every Church must agree&quot;,1
has always been the object of particular attention.
<p>Precisely for this reason, down the centuries the Supreme Pontiffs have
deemed it their special duty, as well as their specific right, to establish
fitting norms to regulate the orderly election of their Successor. Thus, also in
more recent times, my Predecessors Saint Pius X,2 Pius XI,3 Pius XII,4 John
XXIII 5 and lastly Paul VI,6 each with the intention of responding to the needs
of the particular historical moment, issued wise and appropriate regulations in
order to ensure the suitable preparation and orderly gathering of the electors
charged, at the vacancy of the Apostolic See, with the important and weighty
duty of electing the Roman Pontiff.
<p>If I too now turn to this matter, it is certainly not because of any lack of
esteem for those norms, for which I have great respect and which I intend for
the most part to confirm, at least with regard to their substance and the basic
principles which inspired them. What leads me to take this step is awareness of
the Church's changed situation today and the need to take into consideration the
general revision of Canon Law which took place, to the satisfaction of the whole
Episcopate, with the publication and promulgation first of the Code of Canon Law
and subsequently of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. In conformity
with this revision, itself inspired by the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, I
then took up the reform of the Roman Curia in the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor
Bonus</i>.7 Furthermore, Canon 335 of the Code of Canon Law, restated in Canon
47 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, makes clear the need to issue
and constantly update the specific laws regulating the canonical provision for
the Roman See, when for any reason it becomes vacant.
<p>While keeping in mind present-day requirements, I have been careful, in
formulating the new discipline, not to depart in substance from the wise and
venerable tradition already established.
<p>It is in fact an indisputable principle that the Roman Pontiff has the right
to define and adapt to changing times the manner of designating the person
called to assume the Petrine succession in the Roman See. This regards, first of
all, the body entrusted with providing for the election of the Roman Pontiff:
based on a millennial practice sanctioned by specific canonical norms and
confirmed by an explicit provision of the current Code of Canon Law (Canon 349),
this body is made up of the College of Cardinals of Holy Roman Church. While it
is indeed a doctrine of faith that the power of the Supreme Pontiff derives
directly from Christ, whose earthly Vicar he is,8 it is also certain that this
supreme power in the Church is granted to him &quot;by means of lawful election
accepted by him, together with episcopal consecration&quot;.9 A most serious
duty is thus incumbent upon the body responsible for this election. Consequently
the norms which regulate its activity need to be very precise and clear, so that
the election itself will take place in a most worthy manner, as befits the
office of utmost responsibility which the person elected will have to assume, by
divine mandate, at the moment of his assent.
<p>Confirming therefore the norm of the current Code of Canon Law (cf. Canon
349), which reflects the millennial practice of the Church, I once more affirm
that the College of electors of the Supreme Pontiff is composed solely of the
Cardinals of Holy Roman Church. In them one finds expressed in a remarkable
synthesis the two aspects which characterize the figure and office of the
Roman Pontiff: <i>Roman, </i>because identified with the Bishop of the
Church in Rome and thus closely linked to the clergy of this City,
represented by the Cardinals of the presbyteral and diaconal titles of Rome, and
to the Cardinal Bishops of the suburbicarian Sees; <i>Pontiff of the universal
Church, </i>because called to represent visibly the unseen Pastor who leads his
whole flock to the pastures of eternal life. The universality of the Church is
clearly expressed in the very composition of the College of Cardinals, whose
members come from every continent.
<p>In the present historical circumstances, the universality of the Church is
sufficiently expressed by the College of one hundred and twenty electors, made
up of Cardinals coming from all parts of the world and from very different
cultures. I therefore confirm that this is to be the maximum number of Cardinal
electors, while at the same time indicating that it is in no way meant as a sign
of less respect that the provision laid down by my predecessor Pope Paul VI has
been retained, namely, that those Cardinals who celebrate their eightieth
birthday before the day when the Apostolic See becomes vacant do not take part
in the election.10 The reason for this provision is the desire not to add to the
weight of such venerable age the further burden of responsibility for choosing
the one who will have to lead Christ's flock in ways adapted to the needs of the
times. This does not however mean that the Cardinals over eighty years of age
cannot take part in the preparatory meetings of the Conclave, in conformity with
the norms set forth below. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, and
especially during the election of the Supreme Pontiff, they in particular should
lead the People of God assembled in the Patriarchal Basilicas of Rome and in
other churches in the Dioceses throughout the world, supporting the work of the
electors with fervent prayers and supplications to the Holy Spirit and imploring
for them the light needed to make their choice before God alone and with concern
only for the &quot;salvation of souls, which in the Church must always be the
supreme law&quot;.11
<p>It has been my wish to give particular attention to the age-old institution
of the Conclave, the rules and procedures of which have been established and
defined by the solemn ordinances of a number of my Predecessors. A careful
historical examination confirms both the appropriateness of this institution,
given the circumstances in which it originated and gradually took definitive
shape, and its continued usefulness for the orderly, expeditious and proper
functioning of the election itself, especially in times of tension and upheaval.
<p>Precisely for this reason, while recognizing that theologians and canonists
of all times agree that this institution is not of its nature necessary for the
valid election of the Roman Pontiff, I confirm by this Constitution that the
Conclave is to continue in its essential structure; at the same time, I have
made some modifications in order to adapt its procedures to present-day
circumstances. Specifically, I have considered it appropriate to decree that for
the whole duration of the election the living-quarters of the Cardinal electors
and of those called to assist in the orderly process of the election itself are
to be located in suitable places within Vatican City State. Although small, the
State is large enough to ensure within its walls, with the help of the
appropriate measures indicated below, the seclusion and resulting concentration
which an act so vital to the whole Church requires of the electors.
<p>At the same time, in view of the sacredness of the act of election and thus
the need for it to be carried out in an appropriate setting where, on the one
hand, liturgical actions can be readily combined with juridical formalities, and
where, on the other, the electors can more easily dispose themselves to accept
the interior movements of the Holy Spirit, I decree that the election will
continue to take place in the Sistine Chapel, where everything is conducive to
an awareness of the presence of God, in whose sight each person will one day be
judged.
<p>I further confirm, by my apostolic authority, the duty of maintaining the
strictest secrecy with regard to everything that directly or indirectly concerns
the election process itself. Here too, though, I have wished to simplify the
relative norms, reducing them to their essentials, in order to avoid confusion,
doubts and even eventual problems of conscience on the part of those who have
taken part in the election.
<p>Finally, I have deemed it necessary to revise the form of the election
itself in the light of the present-day needs of the Church and the usages of
modern society. I have thus considered it fitting not to retain election by
acclamation <i>quasi ex inspiratione, </i>judging that it is no longer an apt
means of interpreting the thought of an electoral college so great in number and
so diverse in origin. It also appeared necessary to eliminate election <i>per
compromissum, </i>not only because of the difficulty of the procedure, evident
from the unwieldy accumulation of rules issued in the past, but also because
by its very nature it tends to lessen the responsibility of the individual
electors who, in this case, would not be required to express their choice
personally.
<p>After careful reflection I have therefore decided that the only form by
which the electors can manifest their vote in the election of the Roman Pontiff
is by secret ballot, in accordance with the rules set forth below. This form
offers the greatest guarantee of clarity, straightforwardness, simplicity,
openness and, above all, an effective and fruitful participation on the part of
the Cardinals who, individually and as a group, are called to make up the
assembly which elects the Successor of Peter.
<p>With these intentions, I promulgate the present Apostolic Constitution
containing the norms which, when the Roman See becomes vacant, are to be
strictly followed by the Cardinals whose right and duty it is to elect the
Successor of Peter, the visible Head of the whole Church and the Servant of the
servants of God.

<p><b>PART ONE</b>
<p><b>THE VACANCY OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE</b>
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER I</b>
<p><b>THE POWERS OF THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS DURING THE VACANCY OF THE
APOSTOLIC SEE </b></CENTER>
<p>1. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, the College of Cardinals has no
power or jurisdiction in matters which pertain to the Supreme Pontiff during his
lifetime or in the exercise of his office; such matters are to be reserved
completely and exclusively to the future Pope. I therefore declare null and void
any act of power or jurisdiction pertaining to the Roman Pontiff during his
lifetime or in the exercise of his office which the College of Cardinals might
see fit to exercise, beyond the limits expressly permitted in this Constitution.

<p>2. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, the government of the Church is
entrusted to the College of Cardinals solely for the dispatch of ordinary
business and of matters which cannot be postponed (cf. No. 6), and for the
preparation of everything necessary for the election of the new Pope. This task
must be carried out in the ways and within the limits set down by this
Constitution: consequently, those matters are to be absolutely excluded which,
whether by law or by practice, come under the power of the Roman Pontiff alone
or concern the norms for the election of the new Pope laid down in the present
Constitution.

<p>3. I further establish that the College of Cardinals may make no
dispositions whatsoever concerning the rights of the Apostolic See and of the
Roman Church, much less allow any of these rights to lapse, either directly or
indirectly, even though it be to resolve disputes or to prosecute actions
perpetrated against these same rights after the death or valid resignation of
the Pope.12 All the Cardinals are obliged to defend these rights.

<p> 4. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, laws issued by the Roman
Pontiffs can in no way be corrected or modified, nor can anything be added or
subtracted, nor a dispensation be given even from a part of them, especially
with regard to the procedures governing the election of the Supreme Pontiff.
Indeed, should anything be done or even attempted against this prescription, by
my supreme authority I declare it null and void.

<p>5. Should doubts arise concerning the prescriptions contained in this
Constitution, or concerning the manner of putting them into effect, I decree
that all power of issuing a judgment in this regard belongs to the College of
Cardinals, to which I grant the faculty of interpreting doubtful or controverted
points. I also establish that should it be necessary to discuss these or other
similar questions, except the act of election, it suffices that the majority of
the Cardinals present should concur in the same opinion.

<p>6. In the same way, should there be a problem which, in the view of the
majority of the assembled Cardinals, cannot be postponed until another time, the
College of Cardinals may act according to the majority opinion.

<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER II</b>
<p><b>THE CONGREGATIONS OF THE CARDINALS IN PREPARATION FOR THE ELECTION OF
THE SUPREME PONTIFF</b></CENTER>
<p>7. While the See is vacant, there are two kinds of Congregations of the
Cardinals: <i>General </i>Congregations, which include the whole College and
are held before the beginning of the election, and <i>Particular </i>Congregations.
All the Cardinals who are not legitimately impeded must attend the General
Congregations, once they have been informed of the vacancy of the Apostolic See.
Cardinals who, by virtue of No. 33 of this Constitution, do not enjoy the right
of electing the Pope are granted the faculty of not attending these General
Congregations, should they prefer.
<p>The Particular Congregation is made up of the Cardinal Camerlengo of Holy
Roman Church and three Cardinals, one from each Order, chosen by lot from among
the Cardinal electors already present in Rome. The office of these Cardinals,
called Assistants, ceases at the conclusion of the third full day, and their
place is taken by others, also chosen by lot and having the same term of office,
also after the election has begun.
<p>During the time of the election, more important matters are, if necessary,
dealt with by the assembly of the Cardinal electors, while ordinary affairs
continue to be dealt with by the Particular Congregation of Cardinals. In the
General and Particular Congregations, during the vacancy of the Apostolic See,
the Cardinals are to wear the usual black cassock with piping and the red sash,
with skull-cap, pectoral cross and ring.
<p>8. The Particular Congregations are to deal only with questions of lesser
importance which arise on a daily basis or from time to time. But should there
arise more serious questions deserving fuller examination, these must be
submitted to the General Congregation. Moreover, anything decided, resolved or
refused in one Particular Congregation cannot be revoked, altered or granted in
another; the right to do this belongs solely to the General Congregation, and by
a majority vote.
<p>9. The General Congregations of Cardinals are to be held in the Apostolic
Palace in the Vatican or, if circumstances demand it, in another place judged
more suitable by the Cardinals. At these Congregations the Dean of the College
presides or, should he be absent or lawfully impeded, the Subdean. If one or
both of these, in accordance with No. 33 of this Constitution, no longer enjoy
the right of electing the Pope, the assembly of the Cardinal electors will be
presided over by the senior Cardinal elector, according to the customary order
of precedence.
<p>10. Votes in the Congregations of Cardinals, when more important matters
are concerned, are not to be expressed by word of mouth but in a way which
ensures secrecy.
<p>11. The General Congregations preceding the beginning of the election,
which are therefore called &quot;preparatory&quot;, are to be held daily,
beginning on the day which shall be fixed by the Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church
and the senior Cardinal of each of the three Orders among the electors, and
including the days on which the funeral rites for the deceased Pope are
celebrated. In this way the Cardinal Camerlengo can hear the opinion of the
College and communicate whatever is considered necessary or appropriate, while
the individual Cardinals can express their views on possible problems, ask for
explanations in case of doubt and make suggestions.
<p>12. In the first General Congregations provision is to be made for each
Cardinal to have available a copy of this Constitution and at the same time to
have an opportunity to raise questions about the meaning and the implementation
of its norms. The part of the present Constitution regarding the vacancy of the
Apostolic See should also be read aloud. At the same time the Cardinals present
are to swear an oath to observe the prescriptions contained herein and to
maintain secrecy. This oath, which shall also be taken by Cardinals who arrive
late and subsequently take part in these Congregations, is to be read aloud by
the Cardinal Dean or by whoever else presides over the College by virtue of No.
9 of this Constitution, in the presence of the other Cardinals and according to
the following formula:
<p><i>We, the Cardinals of Holy Roman Church, of the Order of Bishops, of
Priests and of Deacons, promise, pledge and swear, as a body and individually,
to observe exactly and faithfully all the norms contained in the Apostolic
Constitution </i>Universi Dominici Gregis <i>of the Supreme Pontiff John Paul
II, and to maintain rigorous secrecy with regard to all matters in any way
related to the election of the Roman Pontiff or those which, by their very
nature, during the vacancy of the Apostolic See, call for the same secrecy.</i>
<p>Next, each Cardinal shall add: <i>And I, N. Cardinal N., so promise, pledge
and swear. </i>And, placing his hand on the Gospels, he will add: <i>So help me
God and these Holy Gospels which I now touch with my hand.</i>
<p>13. In one of the Congregations immediately following, the Cardinals, on
the basis of a prearranged agenda, shall take the more urgent decisions
regarding the beginning of the election. In other words:
<p><i>a</i>) they shall fix the day, hour and manner in which the body of the
deceased Pope shall be brought to the Vatican Basilica in order to be exposed
for the homage of the faithful;
<p><i>b</i>) they shall make all necessary arrangements for the funeral rites
of the deceased Pope, to be celebrated for nine consecutive days, determining
when they are to begin, in such a way that burial will take place, except for
special reasons, between the fourth and sixth day after death;
<p><i>c</i>) they shall see to it that the Commission, made up of the Cardinal
Camerlengo and the Cardinals who had formerly held the offices of Secretary of
State and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, ensures
that the rooms of the <i>Domus Sanctae Marthae </i>are made ready for the
suitable lodging of the Cardinal electors, that rooms suitable for those persons
mentioned in No. 46 of the present Constitution are also made ready, and that
all necessary arrangements are made to prepare the Sistine Chapel so that the
election process can be carried out in a smooth and orderly manner and with
maximum discretion, according to the provisions laid down in this Constitution;
<p><i>d</i>) they shall entrust to two ecclesiastics known for their sound
doctrine, wisdom and moral authority the task of presenting to the Cardinals two
well-prepared meditations on the problems facing the Church at the time and on
the need for careful discernment in choosing the new Pope; at the same time,
without prejudice to the provisions of No. 52 of this Constitution, they shall
fix the day and the time when the first of these meditations is to be given;
<p><i>e</i>) they shall approve &#151; at the proposal of the Administration
of the Apostolic See or, within its competence, of the Governatorato of Vatican
City State &#151; expenses incurred from the death of the Pope until the
election of his successor;
<p><i>f</i>) they shall read any documents left by the deceased Pope for the
College of Cardinals;
<p><i>g</i>) they shall arrange for the destruction of the Fisherman's Ring
and of the lead seal with which Apostolic Letters are despatched;
<p><i>h</i>) they shall make provision for the assignment of rooms by lot to
the Cardinal electors;
<p><i>i</i>) they shall set the day and hour of the beginning of the voting
process.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER III</b>
<p><b>CONCERNING CERTAIN OFFICES DURING THE VACANCY OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE </b></CENTER>
<p>14. According to the provisions of Article 6 of the Apostolic Constitution
<i>Pastor Bonus</i>,13 at the death of the Pope all the heads of the
Dicasteries of the Roman Curia &#151; the Cardinal Secretary of State and the
Cardinal Prefects, the Archbishop Presidents, together with the members of those
Dicasteries &#151; cease to exercise their office. An exception is made for the
Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church and the Major Penitentiary, who continue to
exercise their ordinary functions, submitting to the College of Cardinals
matters that would have had to be referred to the Supreme Pontiff.
<p>Likewise, in conformity with the Apostolic Constitution <i>Vicariae
Potestatis </i>(No. 2 &#167; 1),14 the Cardinal Vicar General for the Diocese of
Rome continues in office during the vacancy of the Apostolic See, as does the
Cardinal Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica and Vicar General for Vatican City
for his jurisdiction.
<p>15. Should the offices of Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church or of Major
Penitentiary be vacant at the time of the Pope's death, or should they become
vacant before the election of his successor, the College of Cardinals shall as
soon as possible elect the Cardinal, or Cardinals as the case may be, who shall
hold these offices until the election of the new Pope. In each of the two cases
mentioned, election takes place by a secret vote of all the Cardinal electors
present, with the use of ballots distributed and collected by the Masters of
Ceremonies. The ballots are then opened in the presence of the Camerlengo and of
the three Cardinal Assistants, if it is a matter of electing the Major
Penitentiary; if it is a matter of electing the Camerlengo, they are opened in
the presence of the said three Cardinals and of the Secretary of the College of
Cardinals. Whoever receives the greatest number of votes shall be elected and
shall <i>ipso facto </i>enjoy all the relevant faculties. In the case of an
equal number of votes, the Cardinal belonging to the higher Order or, if both
are in the same Order, the one first created a Cardinal, shall be appointed.
Until the Camerlengo is elected, his functions are carried out by the Dean of
the College or, if he is absent or lawfully impeded, by the Subdean or by the
senior Cardinal according to the usual order of precedence, in conformity with
No. 9 of this Constitution, who can without delay take the decisions that
circumstances dictate.
<p>16. If during the vacancy of the Apostolic See the Vicar General for the
Diocese of Rome should die, the Vicegerent in office at the time shall also
exercise the office proper to the Cardinal Vicar in addition to the ordinary
vicarious jurisdiction which he already holds.15 Should there not be a
Vicegerent, the Auxiliary Bishop who is senior by appointment will carry out his
functions.
<p>17. As soon as he is informed of the death of the Supreme Pontiff, the
Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church must officially ascertain the Pope's death, in
the presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, of the Cleric
Prelates of the Apostolic Camera and of the Secretary and Chancellor of the
same; the latter shall draw up the official death certificate. The Camerlengo
must also place seals on the Pope's study and bedroom, making provision that the
personnel who ordinarily reside in the private apartment can remain there until
after the burial of the Pope, at which time the entire papal apartment will be
sealed; he must notify the Cardinal Vicar for Rome of the Pope's death,
whereupon the latter shall inform the People of Rome by a special announcement;
he shall notify the Cardinal Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica; he shall take
possession of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican and, either in person or
through a delegate, of the Palaces of the Lateran and of Castel Gandolfo, and
exercise custody and administration of the same; he shall determine, after
consulting the heads of the three Orders of Cardinals, all matters concerning
the Pope's burial, unless during his lifetime the latter had made known his
wishes in this regard; and he shall deal, in the name of and with the consent of
the College of Cardinals, with all matters that circumstances suggest for
safeguarding the rights of the Apostolic See and for its proper
administration. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, the Camerlengo of Holy
Roman Church has the duty of safeguarding and administering the goods and
temporal rights of the Holy See, with the help of the three Cardinal Assistants,
having sought the views of the College of Cardinals, once only for less
important matters, and on each occasion when more serious matters arise.
<p>18. The Cardinal Major Penitentiary and his Officials, during the vacancy
of the Apostolic See, can carry out the duties laid down by my Predecessor Pius
XI in the Apostolic Constitution <i>Quae Divinitus </i>of 25 March 1935,16 and
by myself in the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i>.17
<p>19. The Dean of the College of Cardinals, for his part, as soon as he has
been informed of the Pope's death by the Cardinal Camerlengo or the Prefect of
the Papal Household, shall inform all the Cardinals and convoke them for the
Congregations of the College. He shall also communicate news of the Pope's death
to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the
respective Nations.
<p>20. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, the Substitute of the
Secretariat of State, the Secretary for Relations with States and the
Secretaries of the Dicasteries of the Roman Curia remain in charge of their
respective offices, and are responsible to the College of Cardinals.
<p>21. In the same way, the office and attendant powers of Papal
Representatives do not lapse.
<p>22. The Almoner of His Holiness will also continue to carry out works of
charity in accordance with the criteria employed during the Pope's lifetime. He
will be dependent upon the College of Cardinals until the election of the new
Pope.
<p>23. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, all the civil power of the
Supreme Pontiff concerning the government of Vatican City State belongs to the
College of Cardinals, which however will be unable to issue decrees except in
cases of urgent necessity and solely for the time in which the Holy See is
vacant. Such decrees will be valid for the future only if the new Pope confirms
them.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER IV</b>
<p><b>FACULTIES OF THE DICASTERIES OF THE ROMAN CURIA DURING THE VACANCY OF
THE APOSTOLIC SEE </b></CENTER>
<p>24. During the period of vacancy, the Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, with
the exception of those mentioned in No. 26 of this Constitution, have no faculty
in matters which, <i>Sede plena, </i>they can only deal with or carry out <i>facto
verbo cum Sanctissimo </i>or <i>ex Audientia Sanctissimi </i>or <i>vigore
specialium et extraordinariarum facultatum </i>which the Roman Pontiff is
accustomed to grant to the Prefects, Presidents or Secretaries of those
Dicasteries.
<p>25. The ordinary faculties proper to each Dicastery do not, however, cease
at the death of the Pope. Nevertheless, I decree that the Dicasteries are only
to make use of these faculties for the granting of favours of lesser importance,
while more serious or controverted matters, if they can be postponed, shall be
exclusively reserved to the future Pope. If such matters admit of no delay (as
for example in the case of dispensations which the Supreme Pontiff usually
grants <i>in articulo mortis</i>), they can be entrusted by the College of
Cardinals to the Cardinal who was Prefect until the Pope's death, or to the
Archbishop who was then President, and to the other Cardinals of the same
Dicastery, to whose examination the deceased Supreme Pontiff would probably have
entrusted them. In such circumstances, they will be able to decide <i>per modum
provisionis, </i>until the election of the Pope, what they judge to be most
fitting and appropriate for the preservation and defence of ecclesiastical
rights and traditions.
<p>26. The Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and the Tribunal of the
Roman Rota, during the vacancy of the Holy See, continue to deal with cases in
accordance with their proper laws, with due regard for the prescriptions of
Article 18, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i>.18

<p><b>CHAPTER V</b>
<p><b>THE FUNERAL RITES OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF </b></CENTER>
<p>27. After the death of the Roman Pontiff, the Cardinals will celebrate the
funeral rites for the repose of his soul for nine consecutive days, in
accordance with the <i>Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, </i>the norms of
which, together with those of the <i>Ordo Rituum Conclavis, </i>they are to
observe faithfully.
<p>28. If burial takes place in the Vatican Basilica, the relevant official
document is drawn up by the Notary of the Chapter of the Basilica or by the
Canon Archivist. Subsequently, a delegate of the Cardinal Camerlengo and a
delegate of the Prefect of the Papal Household shall separately draw up
documents certifying that burial has taken place. The former shall do so in the
presence of the members of the Apostolic Camera and the latter in the presence
of the Prefect of the Papal Household.
<p>29. If the Roman Pontiff should die outside Rome, it is the task of the
College of Cardinals to make all necessary arrangements for the dignified and
reverent transfer of the body to the Basilica of Saint Peter's in the Vatican.
<p>30. No one is permitted to use any means whatsoever in order to photograph
or film the Supreme Pontiff either on his sickbed or after death, or to record
his words for subsequent reproduction. If after the Pope's death anyone should
wish to take photographs of him for documentary purposes, he must ask permission
from the Cardinal Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church, who will not however permit
the taking of photographs of the Supreme Pontiff except attired in pontifical
vestments.
<p>31. After the burial of the Supreme Pontiff and during the election of the
new Pope, no part of the private apartment of the Supreme Pontiff is to be lived
in.
<p>32. If the deceased Supreme Pontiff has made a will concerning his
belongings, bequeathing letters and private documents, and has named an executor
thereof, it is the responsibility of the latter to determine and execute, in
accordance with the mandate received from the testator, matters concerning the
private property and writings of the deceased Pope. The executor will give an
account of his activities only to the new Supreme Pontiff.

<p><b>PART TWO</b>
<p><b>THE ELECTION OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF</b>
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER I</b>
<p><b>THE ELECTORS OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF</b> </CENTER>
<p>33. The right to elect the Roman Pontiff belongs exclusively to the
Cardinals of Holy Roman Church, with the exception of those who have reached
their eightieth birthday before the day of the Roman Pontiff's death or the day
when the Apostolic See becomes vacant. The maximum number of Cardinal electors
must not exceed one hundred and twenty. The right of active election by any
other ecclesiastical dignitary or the intervention of any lay power of
whatsoever grade or order is absolutely excluded.
<p>34. If the Apostolic See should become vacant during the celebration of an
Ecumenical Council or of a Synod of Bishops being held in Rome or in any other
place in the world, the election of the new Pope is to be carried out solely and
exclusively by the Cardinal electors indicated in No. 33, and not by the Council
or the Synod of Bishops. For this reason I declare null and void acts which
would in any way temerariously presume to modify the regulations concerning the
election or the college of electors. Moreover, in confirmation of the provisions
of Canons 340 and 347 &#167; 2 of the Code of Canon Law and of Canon 53 of the
Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches in this regard, a Council or Synod of
Bishops, at whatever point they have reached, must be considered immediately
suspended <i>ipso iure, </i>once notification is received of the vacancy of the
Apostolic See. Therefore without any delay all meetings, congregations or
sessions must be interrupted, and the preparation of any decrees or canons,
together with the promulgation of those already confirmed, must be suspended,
under pain of nullity of the same. Neither the Council nor the Synod can
continue for any reason, even though it be most serious or worthy of special
mention, until the new Pope, canonically elected, orders their resumption or
continuation.
<p>35. No Cardinal elector can be excluded from active or passive voice in the
election of the Supreme Pontiff, for any reason or pretext, with due regard for
the provisions of No. 40 of this Constitution.
<p>36. A Cardinal of Holy Roman Church who has been created and published
before the College of Cardinals thereby has the right to elect the Pope, in
accordance with the norm of No. 33 of the present Constitution, even if he has
not yet received the red hat or the ring, or sworn the oath. On the other hand,
Cardinals who have been canonically deposed or who with the consent of the Roman
Pontiff have renounced the cardinalate do not have this right. Moreover,
during the period of vacancy the College of Cardinals cannot readmit or
rehabilitate them.
<p>37. I furthermore decree that, from the moment when the Apostolic See is
lawfully vacant, the Cardinal electors who are present must wait fifteen full
days for those who are absent; the College of Cardinals is also granted the
faculty to defer, for serious reasons, the beginning of the election for a few
days more. But when a maximum of twenty days have elapsed from the beginning of
the vacancy of the See, all the Cardinal electors present are obliged to proceed
to the election.
<p>38. All the Cardinal electors, convoked for the election of the new Pope by
the Cardinal Dean, or by another Cardinal in his name, are required, in virtue
of holy obedience, to obey the announcement of convocation and to proceed to the
place designated for this purpose, unless they are hindered by sickness or by
some other grave impediment, which however must be recognized as such by the
College of Cardinals.
<p>39. However, should any Cardinal electors arrive <i>re integra, </i>that
is, before the new Pastor of the Church has been elected, they shall be allowed
to take part in the election at the stage which it has reached.
<p>40. If a Cardinal with the right to vote should refuse to enter Vatican
City in order to take part in the election, or subsequently, once the election
has begun, should refuse to remain in order to discharge his office, without
manifest reason of illness attested to under oath by doctors and confirmed by
the majority of the electors, the other Cardinals shall proceed freely with the
election, without waiting for him or readmitting him. If on the other hand a
Cardinal elector is constrained to leave Vatican City because of illness, the
election can proceed without asking for his vote; if however he desires to
return to the place of the election, once his health is restored or even before,
he must be readmitted.
<p>Furthermore, if a Cardinal elector leaves Vatican City for some grave
reason, acknowledged as such by the majority of the electors, he can return, in
order once again to take part in the election.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER II</b>
<p><b>THE PLACE OF THE ELECTION AND THOSE ADMITTED TO IT BY REASON OF THEIR
OFFICE </b></CENTER>
<p>41. The Conclave for the election of the Supreme Pontiff shall take place
within the territory of Vatican City, in determined areas and buildings, closed
to unauthorized persons in such a way as to ensure suitable accommodation for
the Cardinal electors and all those legitimately called to cooperate in the
orderly functioning of the election.
<p>42. By the time fixed for the beginning of the election of the Supreme
Pontiff, all the Cardinal electors must have been assigned and must have taken
up suitable lodging in the <i>Domus Sanctae Marthae, </i>recently built in
Vatican City.
<p>If reasons of health, previously confirmed by the appropriate Congregation
of Cardinals, require that a Cardinal elector should have a nurse in attendance,
even during the period of the election, arrangements must be made to provide
suitable accommodation for the latter.
<p>43. From the beginning of the electoral process until the public
announcement that the election of the Supreme Pontiff has taken place, or in any
case until the new Pope so disposes, the rooms of the <i>Domus Sanctae Marthae,
</i>and in particular the Sistine Chapel and the areas reserved for liturgical
celebrations are to be closed to unauthorized persons, by the authority of the
Cardinal Camerlengo and with the outside assistance of the Substitute of the
Secretariat of State, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
following Numbers.
<p>During this period, the entire territory of Vatican City and the
ordinary activity of the offices located therein shall be regulated in a way
which permits the election of the Supreme Pontiff to be carried out with due
privacy and freedom. In particular, provision shall be made to ensure that no
one approaches the Cardinal electors while they are being transported from
the <i> Domus Sanctae Marthae </i>to the Apostolic Vatican Palace.
<p>44. The Cardinal electors, from the beginning of the election until its
conclusion and the public announcement of its outcome, are not to communicate &#151;
whether by writing, by telephone or by any other means of communication &#151;
with persons outside the area where the election is taking place, except in
cases of proven and urgent necessity, duly acknowledged by the Particular
Congregation mentioned in No. 7. It is also the competence of the Particular
Congregation to recognize the necessity and urgency of any communication with
their respective offices on the part of the Cardinal Major Penitentiary, the
Cardinal Vicar General for the Diocese of Rome and the Cardinal Archpriest of
the Vatican Basilica.
<p>45. Anyone not indicated in No. 46 below and who, while legitimately
present in Vatican City in accordance with No. 43 of this Constitution, should
happen to meet one of the Cardinal electors during the time of the election, is
absolutely forbidden to engage in conversation of any sort, by whatever means
and for whatever reason, with that Cardinal.
<p>46. In order to meet the personal and official needs connected with the
election process, the following individuals must be available and therefore
properly lodged in suitable areas within the confines mentioned in No. 43 of
this Constitution: the Secretary of the College of Cardinals, who acts as
Secretary of the electoral assembly; the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations
with two Masters of Ceremonies and two Religious attached to the Papal Sacristy;
and an ecclesiastic chosen by the Cardinal Dean or by the Cardinal taking his
place, in order to assist him in his duties.
<p>There must also be available a number of priests from the regular clergy for
hearing confessions in the different languages, and two medical doctors for
possible emergencies.
<p>Appropriate provisions must also be made beforehand for a suitable number of
persons to be available for preparing and serving meals and for housekeeping.
<p>All the persons indicated here must receive prior approval from the Cardinal
Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants.
<p>47. All the persons listed in No. 46 of this Constitution who in any way or
at any time should come to learn anything from any source, directly or
indirectly, regarding the election process, and in particular regarding the
voting which took place in the election itself, are obliged to maintain strict
secrecy with all persons extraneous to the College of Cardinal electors:
accordingly, before the election begins, they shall take an oath in the form and
using the formula indicated in No. 48.
<p>48. At a suitable time before the beginning of the election, the persons
indicated in No. 46 of this Constitution, having been duly warned about the
meaning and extent of the oath which they are to take, shall, in the presence of
the Cardinal Camerlengo or another Cardinal delegated by him, and of two Masters
of Ceremonies, swear and sign the oath according to the following formula:
<p><i>I, N.N., promise and swear that, unless I should receive a special
faculty given expressly by the newly-elected Pontiff or by his successors, I
will observe absolute and perpetual secrecy with all who are not part of the
College of Cardinal electors concerning all matters directly or indirectly
related to the ballots cast and their scrutiny for the election of the Supreme
Pontiff.</i>
<p><i> I likewise promise and swear to refrain from using any audio or video
equipment capable of recording anything which takes place during the
period of the election within Vatican City, and in particular anything which in
any way, directly or indirectly, is related to the process of the election
itself. I declare that I take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof
will make me subject to the spiritual and canonical penalties which the future
Supreme Pontiff will see fit to adopt, in accordance with Canon 1399 of the Code
of Canon Law.</i>
<p><i> So help me God and these Holy Gospels which I touch with my hand.</i>
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER III</b>
<p><b>THE BEGINNING OF THE ELECTION </b></CENTER>
<p>49. When the funeral rites for the deceased Pope have been celebrated
according to the prescribed ritual, and everything necessary for the regular
functioning of the election has been prepared, on the appointed day &#151; and
thus on the fifteenth day after the death of the Pope or, in conformity with the
provisions of No. 37 of the present Constitution, not later than the twentieth &#151;
the Cardinal electors shall meet in the Basilica of Saint Peter's in the
Vatican, or elsewhere, should circumstances warrant it, in order to take part in
a solemn Eucharistic celebration with the Votive Mass <i>Pro Eligendo Papa</i>.19
This celebration should preferably take place at a suitable hour in the morning,
so that in the afternoon the prescriptions of the following Numbers of this
Constitution can be carried out.
<p>50. From the Pauline Chapel of the Apostolic Palace, where they will
assemble at a suitable hour in the afternoon, the Cardinal electors, in choir
dress, and invoking the assistance of the Holy Spirit with the chant of the <i>Veni
Creator, </i>will solemnly process to the Sistine Chapel of the Apostolic
Palace, where the election will be held.
<p>51. Retaining the essential elements of the Conclave, but modifying some
less important elements which, because of changed circumstances, no longer serve
their original purpose, I establish and decree by the present Constitution that
the election of the Supreme Pontiff, in conformity with the prescriptions
contained in the following Numbers, is to take place exclusively in the Sistine
Chapel of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The Sistine Chapel is therefore
to remain an absolutely enclosed area until the conclusion of the election, so
that total secrecy may be ensured with regard to everything said or done there
in any way pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the election of the Supreme
Pontiff.
<p>It will therefore be the responsibility of the College of Cardinals,
operating under the authority and responsibility of the Camerlengo, assisted by
the Particular Congregation mentioned in No. 7 of the present Constitution, and
with the outside assistance of the Substitute of the Secretariat of State, to
make all prior arrangements for the interior of the Sistine Chapel and adjacent
areas to be prepared, so that the orderly election and its privacy will be
ensured.
<p>In a special way, careful and stringent checks must be made, with the help
of trustworthy individuals of proven technical ability, in order to ensure that
no audiovisual equipment has been secretly installed in these areas for
recording and transmission to the outside.
<p>52. When the Cardinal electors have arrived in the Sistine Chapel, in
accordance with the provisions of No. 50, and still in the presence of those who
took part in the solemn procession, they shall take the oath, reading aloud the
formula indicated in No. 53.
<p>The Cardinal Dean, or the Cardinal who has precedence by order and seniority
in accordance with the provisions of No. 9 of the present Constitution, will
read the formula aloud; then each of the Cardinal electors, touching the Holy
Gospels, will read and recite the formula, as indicated in the following Number.
<p>When the last of the Cardinal electors has taken the oath, the Master of
Papal Liturgical Celebrations will give the order <i>Extra omnes, </i>and all
those not taking part in the Conclave must leave the Sistine Chapel.
<p>The only ones to remain in the Chapel are the Master of Papal Liturgical
Celebrations and the ecclesiastic previously chosen to preach to the Cardinal
electors the second meditation, mentioned in No. 13 d), concerning the grave
duty incumbent on them and thus on the need to act with right intention for the
good of the Universal Church, <i>solum Deum prae oculis habentes.</i>
<p>53. In conformity with the provisions of No. 52, the Cardinal Dean or the
Cardinal who has precedence by order and seniority, will read aloud the
following formula of the oath:
<p><i>We, the Cardinal electors present in this election of the Supreme
Pontiff promise, pledge and swear, as individuals and as a group, to observe
faithfully and scrupulously the prescriptions contained in the Apostolic
Constitution of the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, </i>Universi Dominici Gregis,
<i>published on 22 February 1996. We likewise promise, pledge and swear that
whichever of us by divine disposition is elected Roman Pontiff will commit
himself faithfully to carrying out the </i>munus Petrinum <i>of Pastor of the
Universal Church and will not fail to affirm and defend strenuously the
spiritual and temporal rights and the liberty of the Holy See. In a particular
way, we promise and swear to observe with the greatest fidelity and with all
persons, clerical or lay, secrecy regarding everything that in any way relates
to the election of the Roman Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of
the election, directly or indirectly related to the results of the voting; we
promise and swear not to break this secret in any way, either during or after
the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the
same Pontiff; and never to lend support or favour to any interference,
opposition or any other form of intervention, whereby secular authorities of
whatever order and degree or any group of people or individuals might wish to
intervene in the election of the Roman Pontiff.</i>
<p>Each of the Cardinal electors, according to the order of precedence, will
then take the oath according to the following formula:
<p><i>And I, N. Cardinal N., do so promise, pledge and swear. </i>Placing his
hand on the Gospels, he will add: <i>So help me God and these Holy Gospels
which I touch with my hand.</i>
<p>54. When the ecclesiastic who gives the meditation has concluded, he leaves
the Sistine Chapel together with the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations.
The Cardinal electors, after reciting the prayers found in the relative <i>Ordo,
</i>listen to the Cardinal Dean (or the one taking his place), who begins by
asking the College of electors whether the election can begin, or whether there
still remain doubts which need to be clarified concerning the norms and
procedures laid down in this Constitution. It is not however permitted, even if
the electors are unanimously agreed, to modify or replace any of the norms and
procedures which are a substantial part of the election process, under penalty
of the nullity of the same deliberation.
<p>If, in the judgment of the majority of the electors, there is nothing to
prevent the election process from beginning, it shall start immediately, in
accordance with the procedures indicated in this Constitution.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER IV</b>
<p><b>OBSERVANCE OF SECRECY ON ALL MATTERS CONCERNING THE ELECTION</b></CENTER>
<p>55. The Cardinal Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants <i>pro
tempore </i>are obliged to be especially vigilant in ensuring that there is
absolutely no violation of secrecy with regard to the events occurring in the
Sistine Chapel, where the voting takes place, and in the adjacent areas, before,
as well as during and after the voting.
<p>In particular, relying upon the expertise of two trustworthy technicians,
they shall make every effort to preserve that secrecy by ensuring that no
audiovisual equipment for recording or transmitting has been installed by anyone
in the areas mentioned, and particularly in the Sistine Chapel itself, where the
acts of the election are carried out.
<p>Should any infraction whatsoever of this norm occur and be discovered, those
responsible should know that they will be subject to grave penalties according
to the judgment of the future Pope.
<p>56. For the whole duration of the election, the Cardinal electors are
required to refrain from written correspondence and from all conversations,
including those by telephone or radio, with persons who have not been duly
admitted to the buildings set aside for their use.
<p>Such conversations shall be permitted only for the most grave and urgent
reasons, confirmed by the Particular Congregation of Cardinals mentioned in No.
7.
<p>It shall therefore be the duty of the Cardinal electors to make necessary
arrangements, before the beginning of the election, for the handling of all
non-deferrable official or personal business, so that there will be no need for
conversations of this sort to take place.
<p>57. The Cardinal electors are likewise to refrain from receiving or
sending messages of any kind outside Vatican City; naturally it is prohibited
for any person legitimately present in Vatican City to deliver such
messages. It is specifically prohibited to the Cardinal electors, for the
entire duration of the election, to receive newspapers or periodicals of any
sort, to listen to the radio or to watch television.
<p>58. Those who, in accordance with the prescriptions of No. 46 of the
present Constitution, carry out any functions associated with the election, and
who directly or indirectly could in any way violate secrecy &#151; whether by
words or writing, by signs or in any other way &#151; are absolutely obliged to
avoid this, lest they incur the penalty of excommunication <i>latae sententiae
</i>reserved to the Apostolic See.
<p>59. In particular, the Cardinal electors are forbidden to reveal to any
other person, directly or indirectly, information about the voting and about
matters discussed or decided concerning the election of the Pope in the meetings
of Cardinals, both before and during the time of the election. This obligation
of secrecy also applies to the Cardinals who are not electors but who take part
in the General Congregations in accordance with No. 7 of the present
Constitution.
<p>60. I further order the Cardinal electors, <i>graviter onerata ipsorum
conscientia, </i>to maintain secrecy concerning these matters also after the
election of the new Pope has taken place, and I remind them that it is not licit
to break the secret in any way unless a special and explicit permission has been
granted by the Pope himself.
<p>61. Finally, in order that the Cardinal electors may be protected from the
indiscretion of others and from possible threats to their independence of
judgment and freedom of decision, I absolutely forbid the introduction into the
place of the election, under whatsoever pretext, or the use, should they have
been introduced, of technical instruments of any kind for the recording,
reproducing or transmitting of sound, visual images or writing.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER V</b>
<p><b>THE ELECTION PROCEDURE</b> </CENTER>
<p>62. Since the forms of election known as <i>per acclamationem seu
inspirationem </i>and <i>per compromissum </i>are abolished, the form of
electing the Roman Pontiff shall henceforth be <i>per scrutinium </i>alone.
<p>I therefore decree that for the valid election of the Roman Pontiff two
thirds of the votes are required, calculated on the basis of the total number of
electors present.
<p>Should it be impossible to divide the number of Cardinals present into three
equal parts, for the validity of the election of the Supreme Pontiff one
additional vote is required.
<p>63. The election is to begin immediately after the provisions of No. 54 of
the present Constitution have been duly carried out.
<p>Should the election begin on the afternoon of the first day, only one ballot
is to be held; then, on the following days, if no one was elected on the first
ballot, two ballots shall be held in the morning and two in the afternoon. The
voting is to begin at a time which shall have been determined earlier, either in
the preparatory Congregations or during the election period, but in accordance
with the procedures laid down in Nos. 64ff of the present Constitution.
<p>64. The voting process is carried out in three phases. The first phase,
which can be called the <i>pre-scrutiny, </i>comprises: 1) the preparation and
distribution of the ballot papers by the Masters of Ceremonies, who give at
least two or three to each Cardinal elector; 2) the drawing by lot, from among
all the Cardinal electors, of three Scrutineers, of three persons charged with
collecting the votes of the sick, called for the sake of brevity <i>Infirmarii,
</i>and of three Revisers; this drawing is carried out in public by the junior
Cardinal Deacon, who draws out nine names, one after another, of those who shall
carry out these tasks; 3) if, in the drawing of lots for the Scrutineers, <i>Infirmarii
</i>and Revisers, there should come out the names of Cardinal electors who
because of infirmity or other reasons are unable to carry out these tasks, the
names of others who are not impeded are to be drawn in their place. The first
three drawn will act as Scrutineers, the second three as <i>Infirmarii </i>and
the last three as Revisers.
<p>65. For this phase of the voting process the following norms must be
observed: 1) the ballot paper must be rectangular in shape and must bear in the
upper half, in print if possible, the words <i>Eligo in Summum Pontificem; </i>on
the lower half there must be a space left for writing the name of the person
chosen; thus the ballot is made in such a way that it can be folded in two; 2)
the completion of the ballot must be done in secret by each Cardinal elector,
who will write down legibly, as far as possible in handwriting that cannot be
identified as his, the name of the person he chooses, taking care not to write
other names as well, since this would make the ballot null; he will then fold
the ballot twice; 3) during the voting, the Cardinal electors are to remain
alone in the Sistine Chapel; therefore, immediately after the distribution of
the ballots and before the electors begin to write, the Secretary of the College
of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of
Ceremonies must leave the Chapel. After they have left, the junior Cardinal
Deacon shall close the door, opening and closing it again each time this is
necessary, as for example when the <i>Infirmarii </i>go to collect the votes of
the sick and when they return to the Chapel.
<p>66. The second phase, the <i>scrutiny </i>proper, comprises: 1) the
placing of the ballots in the appropriate receptacle; 2) the mixing and counting
of the ballots; 3) the opening of the votes. Each Cardinal elector, in order of
precedence, having completed and folded his ballot, holds it up so that it can
be seen and carries it to the altar, at which the Scrutineers stand and upon
which there is placed a receptacle, covered by a plate, for receiving the
ballots. Having reached the altar, the Cardinal elector says aloud the words of
the following oath: <i>I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my
judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be
elected. </i>He then places the ballot on the plate, with which he drops it into
the receptacle. Having done this, he bows to the altar and returns to his place.
<p>If any of the Cardinal electors present in the Chapel is unable to go to the
altar because of infirmity, the last of the Scrutineers goes to him. The infirm
elector, having pronounced the above oath, hands the folded ballot to the
Scrutineer, who carries it in full view to the altar and omitting the oath,
places it on the plate, with which he drops it into the receptacle.
<p>67. If there are Cardinal electors who are sick and confined to their
rooms, referred to in Nos. 41ff of this Constitution, the three <i>Infirmarii
</i>go to them with a box which has an opening in the top through which a folded
ballot can be inserted. Before giving the box to the <i>Infirmarii, </i>the
Scrutineers open it publicly, so that the other electors can see that it is
empty; they are then to lock it and place the key on the altar. The <i>Infirmarii,
</i>taking the locked box and a sufficient number of ballot papers on a small
tray, then go, duly accompanied, to the <i>Domus Sanctae Marthae </i>to each
sick elector, who takes a ballot, writes his vote in secret, folds the ballot
and, after taking the above-mentioned oath, puts it through the opening in the
box. If any of the electors who are sick is unable to write, one of the three
<i>Infirmarii </i>or another Cardinal elector chosen by the sick man, having
taken an oath before the <i>Infirmarii </i>concerning the observance of
secrecy, carries out the above procedure. The <i>Infirmarii </i>then take the
box back into the Chapel, where it shall be opened by the Scrutineers after the
Cardinals present have cast their votes. The Scrutineers then count the ballots
in the box and, having ascertained that their number corresponds to the number
of those who are sick, place them one by one on the plate and then drop them all
together into the receptacle. In order not to prolong the voting process unduly,
the <i>Infirmarii </i>may complete their own ballots and place them in the
receptable immediately after the senior Cardinal, and then go to collect the
votes of the sick in the manner indicated above while the other electors are
casting their votes.
<p>68. After all the ballots of the Cardinal electors have been placed in the
receptacle, the first Scrutineer shakes it several times in order to mix them,
and immediately afterwards the last Scrutineer proceeds to count them, picking
them out of the urn in full view and placing them in another empty
receptacle previously prepared for this purpose. If the number of ballots does
not correspond to the number of electors, the ballots must all be burned and a
second vote taken at once; if however their number does correspond to the number
of electors, the opening of the ballots then takes place in the following
manner.
<p>69. The Scrutineers sit at a table placed in front of the altar. The first
of them takes a ballot, unfolds it, notes the name of the person chosen and
passes the ballot to the second Scrutineer, who in his turn notes the name of
the person chosen and passes the ballot to the third, who reads it out in a loud
and clear voice, so that all the electors present can record the vote on a sheet
of paper prepared for that purpose. He himself writes down the name read from
the ballot. If during the opening of the ballots the Scrutineers should discover
two ballots folded in such a way that they appear to have been completed by one
elector, if these ballots bear the same name they are counted as one vote; if
however they bear two different names, neither vote will be valid; however, in
neither of the two cases is the voting session annulled.
<p>When all the ballots have been opened, the Scrutineers add up the sum of the
votes obtained by the different names and write them down on a separate sheet of
paper. The last Scrutineer, as he reads out the individual ballots, pierces each
one with a needle through the word <i>Eligo </i>and places it on a thread, so
that the ballots can be more securely preserved. After the names have been read
out, the ends of the thread are tied in a knot, and the ballots thus joined
together are placed in a receptacle or on one side of the table.
<p>70. There then follows the third and last phase, also known as the <i>post-scrutiny,
</i>which comprises: 1) the counting of the votes; 2) the checking of the same;
3) the burning of the ballots.
<p>The Scrutineers add up all the votes that each individual has received, and
if no one has obtained two thirds of the votes on that ballot, the Pope has not
been elected; if however it turns out that someone has obtained two thirds of
the votes, the canonically valid election of the Roman Pontiff has taken place.
<p>In either case, that is, whether the election has occurred or not, the
Revisers must proceed to check both the ballots and the notes made by the
Scrutineers, in order to make sure that these latter have performed their task
exactly and faithfully.
<p>Immediately after the checking has taken place, and before the Cardinal
electors leave the Sistine Chapel, all the ballots are to be burnt by the
Scrutineers, with the assistance of the Secretary of the Conclave and the
Masters of Ceremonies who in the meantime have been summoned by the junior
Cardinal Deacon. If however a second vote is to take place immediately, the
ballots from the first vote will be burned only at the end, together with those
from the second vote.
<p>71. In order that secrecy may be better observed, I order each and every
Cardinal elector to hand over to the Cardinal Camerlengo or to one of the three
Cardinal Assistants any notes which he may have in his possession concerning the
results of each ballot. These notes are to be burnt together with the ballots.
<p>I further lay down that at the end of the election the Cardinal Camerlengo
of Holy Roman Church shall draw up a document, to be approved also by the three
Cardinal Assistants, declaring the result of the voting at each session. This
document is to be given to the Pope and will thereafter be kept in a designated
archive, enclosed in a sealed envelope, which may be opened by no one unless the
Supreme Pontiff gives explicit permission.
<p>72. Confirming the dispositions of my Predecessors, Saint Pius X,20 Pius
XII 21 and Paul VI,22 I decree that &#151; except for the afternoon of the
entrance into the Conclave &#151; both in the morning and in the afternoon,
after a ballot which does not result in an election, the Cardinal electors shall
proceed immediately to a second one, in which they are to express their vote
anew. In this second ballot all the formalities of the previous one are to be
observed, with the difference that the electors are not bound to take a new oath
or to choose new Scrutineers, <i>Infirmarii </i>and Revisers. Everything done
in this regard for the first ballot will be valid for the second one, without
the need for any repetition.
<p>73. Everything that has been laid down above concerning the voting
procedures must be diligently observed by the Cardinal electors in all the
ballots, which are to take place each day, in the morning and in the afternoon,
after the celebration of the sacred rites or prayers laid down in the <i>Ordo
Rituum Conclavis.</i>
<p><i> </i>74. In the event that the Cardinal electors find it difficult to
agree on the person to be elected, after balloting has been carried out for
three days in the form described above (in Nos. 62ff) without result, voting is
to be suspended for a maximum of one day in order to allow a pause for prayer,
informal discussion among the voters, and a brief spiritual exhortation given by
the senior Cardinal in the Order of Deacons. Voting is then resumed in the usual
manner, and after seven ballots, if the election has not taken place, there is
another pause for prayer, discussion and an exhortation given by the senior
Cardinal in the Order of Priests. Another series of seven ballots is then held
and, if there has still been no election, this is followed by a further pause
for prayer, discussion and an exhortation given by the senior Cardinal in the
Order of Bishops. Voting is then resumed in the usual manner and, unless the
election occurs, it is to continue for seven ballots.
<p>75. If the balloting does not result in an election, even after the
provisions of No. 74 have been fulfilled, the Cardinal electors shall be invited
by the Camerlengo to express an opinion about the manner of proceeding. The
election will then proceed in accordance with what the absolute majority of the
electors decides.
<p>Nevertheless, there can be no waiving of the requirement that a valid
election takes place only by an absolute majority of the votes or else by voting
only on the two names which in the ballot immediately preceding have received
the greatest number of votes; also in this second case only an absolute majority
is required.
<p>76. Should the election take place in a way other than that prescribed in
the present Constitution, or should the conditions laid down here not be
observed, the election is for this very reason null and void, without any need
for a declaration on the matter; consequently, it confers no right on the one
elected.
<p>77. I decree that the dispositions concerning everything that precedes the
election of the Roman Pontiff and the carrying out of the election itself must
be observed in full, even if the vacancy of the Apostolic See should occur as a
result of the resignation of the Supreme Pontiff, in accordance with the
provisions of Canon 333 &#167; 2 of the Code of Canon Law and Canon 44 &#167; 2
of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

<p><b>CHAPTER VI</b>
<p><b>MATTERS TO BE OBSERVED OR AVOIDED IN THE ELECTION OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF
</b></CENTER>
<p>78. If &#151; God forbid &#151; in the election of the Roman Pontiff the
crime of simony were to be perpetrated, I decree and declare that all those
guilty thereof shall incur excommunication <i>latae sententiae. </i>At the same
time I remove the nullity or invalidity of the same simoniacal provision, in
order that &#151; as was already established by my Predecessors &#151; the
validity of the election of the Roman Pontiff may not for this reason be
challenged.23
<p>79. Confirming the prescriptions of my Predecessors, I likewise forbid
anyone, even if he is a Cardinal, during the Pope's lifetime and without having
consulted him, to make plans concerning the election of his successor, or to
promise votes, or to make decisions in this regard in private gatherings.
<p>80. In the same way, I wish to confirm the provisions made by my
Predecessors for the purpose of excluding any external interference in the
election of the Supreme Pontiff. Therefore, in virtue of holy obedience and
under pain of excommunication <i>latae sententiae, </i>I again forbid each and
every Cardinal elector, present and future, as also the Secretary of the College
of Cardinals and all other persons taking part in the preparation and carrying
out of everything necessary for the election, to accept under any pretext
whatsoever, from any civil authority whatsoever, the task of proposing the <i>veto
</i>or the so-called <i>exclusiva, </i>even under the guise of a simple desire,
or to reveal such either to the entire electoral body assembled together or to
individual electors, in writing or by word of mouth, either directly and
personally or indirectly and through others, both before the election begins and
for its duration. I intend this prohibition to include all possible forms of
interference, opposition and suggestion whereby secular authorities of whatever
order and degree, or any individual or group, might attempt to exercise
influence on the election of the Pope.
<p>81. The Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact,
agreement, promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to
give or deny their vote to a person or persons. If this were in fact done, even
under oath, I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no
one shall be bound to observe it; and I hereby impose the penalty of
excommunication <i>latae sententiae </i>upon those who violate this
prohibition. It is not my intention however to forbid, during the period in
which the See is vacant, the exchange of views concerning the election.
<p>82. I likewise forbid the Cardinals before the election to enter into any
stipulations, committing themselves of common accord to a certain course of
action should one of them be elevated to the Pontificate. These promises too,
should any in fact be made, even under oath, I also declare null and void.
<p>83. With the same insistence shown by my Predecessors, I earnestly exhort
the Cardinal electors not to allow themselves to be guided, in choosing the
Pope, by friendship or aversion, or to be influenced by favour or personal
relationships towards anyone, or to be constrained by the interference of
persons in authority or by pressure groups, by the suggestions of the mass
media, or by force, fear or the pursuit of popularity. Rather, having before
their eyes solely the glory of God and the good of the Church, and having prayed
for divine assistance, they shall give their vote to the person, even outside
the College of Cardinals, who in their judgment is most suited to govern the
universal Church in a fruitful and beneficial way.
<p>84. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, and above all during the time
of the election of the Successor of Peter, the Church is united in a very
special way with her Pastors and particularly with the Cardinal electors of the
Supreme Pontiff, and she asks God to grant her a new Pope as a gift of his
goodness and providence. Indeed, following the example of the first Christian
community spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles (cf. 1:14), the universal
Church, spiritually united with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, should persevere with
one heart in prayer; thus the election of the new Pope will not be something
unconnected with the People of God and concerning the College of electors alone,
but will be in a certain sense an act of the whole Church. I therefore lay down
that in all cities and other places, at least the more important ones, as soon
as news is received of the vacancy of the Apostolic See and, in particular, of
the death of the Pope, and following the celebration of his solemn funeral
rites, humble and persevering prayers are to be offered to the Lord (cf. <i>Mt
</i>21:22; <i>Mk </i>11:24), that he may enlighten the electors and make them
so likeminded in their task that a speedy, harmonious and fruitful election may
take place, as the salvation of souls and the good of the whole People of God
demand.
<p>85. In a most earnest and heartfelt way I recommend this prayer to the
venerable Cardinals who, by reason of age, no longer enjoy the right to take
part in the election of the Supreme Pontiff. By virtue of the singular bond with
the Apostolic See which the Cardinalate represents, let them lead the prayer of
the People of God, whether gathered in the Patriarchal Basilicas of the city of
Rome or in places of worship in other particular Churches, fervently imploring
the assistance of Almighty God and the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit for the
Cardinal electors, especially at the time of the election itself. They will
thereby participate in an effective and real way in the difficult task of
providing a Pastor for the universal Church.
<p>86. I also ask the one who is elected not to refuse, for fear of its
weight, the office to which he has been called, but to submit humbly to the
design of the divine will. God who imposes the burden will sustain him with his
hand, so that he will be able to bear it. In conferring the heavy task upon him,
God will also help him to accomplish it and, in giving him the dignity, he will
grant him the strength not to be overwhelmed by the weight of his office.
<CENTER>
<p><b>CHAPTER VII</b>
<p><b>THE ACCEPTANCE AND PROCLAMATION OF THE NEW POPE AND THE BEGINNING OF HIS
MINISTRY</b></CENTER>
<p>87. When the election has canonically taken place, the junior Cardinal
Deacon summons into the hall of election the Secretary of the College of
Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations. The Cardinal Dean, or
the Cardinal who is first in order and seniority, in the name of the whole
College of electors, then asks the consent of the one elected in the following
words: <i>Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff? </i>And, as
soon as he has received the consent, he asks him: <i>By what name do you wish
to be called? </i>Then the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, acting as
notary and having as witnesses two Masters of Ceremonies, who are to be summoned
at that moment, draws up a document certifying acceptance by the new Pope and
the name taken by him.
<p>88. After his acceptance, the person elected, if he has already received
episcopal ordination, is immediately Bishop of the Church of Rome, true Pope and
Head of the College of Bishops. He thus acquires and can exercise full and
supreme power over the universal Church.
<p>If the person elected is not already a Bishop, he shall immediately be
ordained Bishop.
<p>89. When the other formalities provided for in the <i>Ordo Rituum
Conclavis </i>have been carried out, the Cardinal electors approach the
newly-elected Pope in the prescribed manner, in order to make an act of homage
and obedience. An act of thanksgiving to God is then made, after which the
senior Cardinal Deacon announces to the waiting people that the election has
taken place and proclaims the name of the new Pope, who immediately thereafter
imparts the Apostolic Blessing <i>Urbi et Orbi </i>from the balcony of the
Vatican Basilica.
<p>If the person elected is not already a Bishop, homage is paid to him and the
announcement of his election is made only after he has been solemnly ordained
Bishop.
<p>90. If the person elected resides outside Vatican City, the norms contained
in the <i>Ordo Rituum Conclavis </i>are to be observed.
<p>If the newly-elected Supreme Pontiff is not already a Bishop, his episcopal
ordination, referred to in Nos. 88 and 89 of the present Constitution, shall be
carried out according to the usage of the Church by the Dean of the College of
Cardinals or, in his absence, by the Subdean or, should he too be prevented from
doing so, by the senior Cardinal Bishop.
<p>91. The Conclave ends immediately after the new Supreme Pontiff assents to
his election, unless he should determine otherwise. From that moment the new
Pope can be approached by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State, the
Secretary for Relations with States, the Prefect of the Papal Household and by
anyone else needing to discuss with him matters of importance at the time.
<p>92. After the solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the Pontificate and
within an appropriate time, the Pope will take possession of the Patriarchal
Archbasilica of the Lateran, according to the prescribed ritual.

<CENTER>
<p><b>PROMULGATION</b></CENTER>
<p>Wherefore, after mature reflection and following the example of my
Predecessors, I lay down and prescribe these norms and I order that no one shall
presume to contest the present Constitution and anything contained herein for
any reason whatsoever. This Constitution is to be completely observed by all,
notwithstanding any disposition to the contrary, even if worthy of special
mention. It is to be fully and integrally implemented and is to serve as a guide
for all to whom it refers.
<p>As determined above, I hereby declare abrogated all Constitutions and Orders
issued in this regard by the Roman Pontiffs, and at the same time I declare
completely null and void anything done by any person, whatever his authority,
knowingly or unknowingly, in any way contrary to this Constitution.

Chair of Saint Peter, Apostle, in the year 1996, the eighteenth of my
Pontificate.</i>
