<h1>Vi &egrave; ben noto</h1>  
<p><b>On the Rosary and Public Life
<br>His Holiness Pope Leo XIII
<br>September 20, 1887</b>

<p><i>To the Bishops of Italy.</i>

<p>Venerable Brethren,

<p>YOU KNOW HOW WE PLACE amid present dangers Our confidence in the Glorious
Virgin of the Holy Rosary, for the safety and prosperity of Christendom and
the peace and tranquillity of the Church. Mindful that in moments of great
trial, pastors and people have ever had recourse with entire confidence to
the august Mother of God, in whose hands are all graces, certain too, that
devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary is most opportune for the needs of these
times, We have desired to revive everywhere this devotion, and to spread it
far and wide among the faithful of the world. Oftentimes already We, in
recommending the pious practice of devoting October to honoring Our Lady,
have pointed out Our reasons and hope for so doing, and the forms to be
observed; and the entire Church, docile to Our desires, has ever replied by
special manifestations of devotion; and now is making ready to pay to Mary,
during a whole month, a daily tribute of the devotion so dear to it. In
such pious rivalry Italy has not been behind-hand, for devotion to Our Lady
is deeply and widely rooted in this land; and We doubt not that this year
too, Italy will set a glorious example of love for the august Mother of
God, and will give Us fresh reasons for consolation and hope. Nevertheless
We cannot do less than address to you, Venerable Brethren, a few words of
exhortation, so that with particular and renewed zeal the month dedicated
to the Most Holy Virgin of the Rosary may be sanctified in every diocese of
Italy.

<p>2. It is easy to imagine what reasons We have for doing this. Since God
called Us to govern His Church on earth, We have sought to use every
possible means that We deemed suitable, for the sanctification of souls
and the extension of the reign of Jesus Christ. We have excepted from Our
daily solicitude no nation and no people, mindful that Our Redeemer shed
His precious blood on the Cross and opened the reign of grace and of glory
for all. None, however, can be surprised that We showed special care for
the Italian people, for Our Divine Master Jesus Christ chose, from out all
the world, Italy to be the seat of His Vicar on earth, and in His
providential designs appointed Rome to be the capital of the Catholic
world. On this account the Italian people is called upon to live close to
the Father of the whole Christian family, and to share in a special way in
his sorrows and his glory. Unfortunately We find in Italy much to sadden
Our souls. Faith and Christian morals, the precious inheritance
bequeathed by Our ancestors, and in all past times the glory of Our
country and of Italy's great ones, are being attacked artfully and in
covert ways, or even openly, with cynicism that is revolting, by a handful
of men who seek to rob others of that faith and morality they have
themselves lost. In this more especially is seen the work of the sects,
and of those who are more or less their willing tools. Above all, in this
city of Rome, where Christ's Vicar has his See are their efforts
concentrated and their diabolical designs displayed with ferocious
obstinacy.

<p>3. We need not tell you, Venerable Brethren, with what bitterness Our soul
is filled at seeing the danger there is for the salvation of so many of Our
beloved children. And Our sorrow is greater because We find it impossible
to oppose such great evil with that salutary efficacy We would desire and
that We have the right to use, for you know, Venerable Brethren, and all
the world knows, the state to which we are reduced. On this account We feel
a still greater desire to call upon the Mother of God and to ask her help.
Let all good Italians pray for their misguided brethren, for their common
Father the Roman Pontiff, that God, in His infinite mercy, may hear and
answer the prayers of a father and his sons. And Our most lively and sure
hope is placed in the Queen of the Rosary, who has shown herself, since she
has been invoked by that title, so ready to help the Church and Christian
peoples in their necessities. Already have We recorded these glories and
the great triumphs won over the Albigenses and other powerful enemies,
glories and triumphs which have not only profited the Church, afflicted and
persecuted, but also the temporal welfare of peoples and nations. Why in
this hour of need should We not behold again such marvels of the power and
goodness of the august Virgin, for the good of the Church and its Head, and
of the whole Christian world, if the faithful only revive, on their part,
the magnificent examples of piety given by their forefathers, under similar
circumstances? And to make this most powerful Queen more and more
propitious, We would honor her more and more in the invocation of the
Rosary, and increase this devotion. And to this end We have made a double
of the second class for all the Church of the Feast of the Rosary. And for
the same purpose We ardently desire the Catholics of Italy, with lively
faith, especially during this month of October, to invoke this august
Virgin and to do loving violence to her mother's heart, and to pray to her
for the triumph of the Church and the Apostolic See, for the liberty of the
Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth, and for peace and public prosperity. And,
since the effects of such prayers will be proportionate to the dispositions
of those offering them, We ardently exhort you, venerable brethren, devote
all your care and zeal to kindle among those committed to your charge a
strong, living and active faith, and to call on all to return by penance to
grace and to the faithful fulfillment of; all their duties. Among such
duties, considering the state of the times, must be reckoned as paramount
an open and sincere profession of the fait and teaching of Jesus Christ,
casting aside al human respect, and considering before all thing the
interest of religion and the salvation of souls. It cannot be concealed
that, although thanks to the mercy of God religious feeling is strong and
widely spread among Italians, nevertheless by the evil influence of men and
the times religious indifference is on the increase, and hence there is
lessening of that respect and filial love for the Church which was the
glory of our ancestors and in which they placed their highest ambition. Let
it be your work, venerable brethren, to revive this Christian feeling among
your people, an interest in the Catholic cause, a confidence in Our Lady'
help, and a spirit of prayer. It is certain that the august Queen, invoked
thus well by her many sons, would deign to hear their prayer, console Us in
Our sorrow, and crown Our efforts for the Church and for Italy, by granting
better times to both. With these desires, We bestow on you venerable
brethren, and the clergy and people committed to your care, the Apostolic
Benediction as a promise of graces and favors of the highest kind from heaven.

<p>Given at the Vatican this 20th day of September 1887.
