<h1>Vix Pervenit</h1>  

<p><b>His Holiness Pope Benedict XIV</b>
<br><b>On Usury and Other Dishonest Profit</b>
<br><b>November 1, 1745</b>

<p><i>To the Venerable Brothers, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and Ordinary Clergy of Italy.</i>

<p>Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>HARDLY HAD the new controversy (namely, whether certain contracts should
be held valid) come to our attention, when several opinions began spreading
in Italy that hardly seemed to agree with sound doctrine; We decided that
We must remedy this. If We did not do so immediately, such an evil might
acquire new force by delay and silence. If we neglected our duty, it
might even spread further, shaking those cities of Italy so far not affected.

<p>Therefore We decided to consult with a number of the Cardinals of the
Holy Roman Church, who are renowned for their knowledge and competence in
theology and canon law. We also called upon many from the regular clergy
who were outstanding in both the faculty of theology and that of canon
law. We chose some monks, some mendicants, and finally some from the regular
clergy. As presiding officer, We appointed one with degrees in both
canon and civil law, who had lengthy court experience. We chose the past July
4 for the meeting at which We explained the nature of the whole business.
We learned that all had known and considered it already.

<p>2. We then ordered them to consider carefully all aspects of the matter,
meanwhile searching for a solution; after this consideration, they were
to write out their conclusions. We did not ask them to pass judgment on the
contract which gave rise to the controversy since the many documents
they would need were not available. Rather We asked that they establish a
fixed teaching on
<a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>,
since the opinions recently spread abroad seemed to
contradict the Church's doctrine. All complied with these orders. They
gave their opinions publicly in two convocations, the first of which was held
in our presence last July 18, the other last August 1; then they submitted
their opinions in writing to the secretary of the convocation.

<p>3. Indeed they proved to be of one mind in their opinions.

<blockquote>
I. The nature of the sin called usury has its proper place and origin in
a loan contract. This financial contract between consenting parties
demands, by its very nature, that one return to another only as much as he has
received. The sin rests on the fact that sometimes the creditor desires
more than he has given. Therefore he contends some gain is owed him
beyond that which he loaned, but any gain which exceeds the amount he gave is
illicit and usurious.

<p>II. One cannot condone the sin of usury by arguing that the gain is not
great or excessive, but rather moderate or small; neither can it be
condoned by arguing that the borrower is rich; nor even by arguing that
the money borrowed is not left idle, but is spent usefully, either to
increase one's fortune, to purchase new estates, or to engage in business
transactions. The law governing loans consists necessarily in the
equality of what is given and returned; once the equality has been established,
whoever demands more than that violates the terms of the loan. Therefore
if one receives
<a href="../cathen/08077a.htm">interest</a>,
he must make restitution according to the
commutative bond of justice; its function in human contracts is to
assure equality for each one. This law is to be observed in a holy manner. If
not observed exactly, reparation must be made.

<p>III. By these remarks, however, We do not deny that at times together
with the loan contract certain other titles-which are not at all intrinsic to
the contract-may run parallel with it. From these other titles, entirely
just and legitimate reasons arise to demand something over and above the
amount due on the contract. Nor is it denied that it is very often
possible for someone, by means of contracts differing entirely from loans, to
spend and invest money legitimately either to provide oneself with an annual
income or to engage in legitimate trade and business. From these types
of contracts honest gain may be made.

<p>IV. There are many different contracts of this kind. In these contracts,
if equality is not maintained, whatever is received over and above what is
fair is a real injustice. Even though it may not fall under the precise
rubric of usury (since all reciprocity, both open and hidden, is
absent), restitution is obligated. Thus if everything is done correctly and
weighed in the scales of justice, these same legitimate contracts suffice to
provide a standard and a principle for engaging in commerce and fruitful
business for the common good. Christian minds should not think that
gainful commerce can flourish by usuries or other similar injustices. On the
contrary We learn from divine Revelation that justice raises up nations;
sin, however, makes nations miserable.

<p>V. But you must diligently consider this, that some will falsely and
rashly persuade themselves-and such people can be found anywhere-that together
with loan contracts there are other legitimate titles or, excepting loan
contracts, they might convince themselves that other just contracts
exist, for which it is permissible to receive a moderate amount of interest.
Should any one think like this, he will oppose not only the judgment of
the Catholic Church on usury, but also common human sense and natural
reason. Everyone knows that man is obliged in many instances to help his fellows
with a simple, plain loan. Christ Himself teaches this: "Do not refuse
to lend to him who asks you." In many circumstances, no other true and just
contract may be possible except for a loan. Whoever therefore wishes to
follow his conscience must first diligently inquire if, along with the
loan, another category exists by means of which the gain he seeks may be
lawfully attained.
</blockquote>

4. This is how the Cardinals and theologians and the men most conversant
with the canons, whose advice We had asked for in this most serious
business, explained their opinions. Also We devoted our private study to
this matter before the congregations were convened, while they were in
session, and again after they had been held; for We read the opinions of
these outstanding men most diligently. Because of this, We approve and
confirm whatever is contained in the opinions above, since the
professors of Canon Law and Theology, scriptural evidence, the decrees of
previous
popes, and the authority of Church councils and the Fathers all seem to
enjoin it. Besides, We certainly know the authors who hold the opposite
opinions and also those who either support and defend those authors or
at least who seem to give them consideration. We are also aware that the
theologians of regions neighboring those in which the controversy had
its origin undertook the defense of the truth with wisdom and seriousness.

<p>5. Therefore We address these encyclical letters to all Italian
Archbishops, Bishops, and priests to make all of you aware of these
matters. Whenever Synods are held or sermons preached or instructions on
sacred doctrine given, the above opinions must be adhered to strictly.
Take great care that no one in your dioceses dares to write or preach the
contrary; however if any one should refuse to obey, he should be
subjected to the penalties imposed by the sacred canons on those who violate
Apostolic mandates.

<p>6. Concerning the specific contract which caused these new
controversies, We decide nothing for the present; We also shall not decide now
about
the other contracts in which the theologians and canonists lack agreement.
Rekindle your zeal for piety and your conscientiousness so that you may
execute what We have given.

<p>7. First of all, show your people with persuasive words that the sin and
vice of usury is most emphatically condemned in the Sacred Scriptures;
that it assumes various forms and appearances in order that the faithful,
restored to liberty and grace by the blood of Christ, may again be
driven headlong into ruin. Therefore, if they desire to invest their money, let
them exercise diligent care lest they be snatched by cupidity, the
source of all evil; to this end, let them be guided by those who excel in
doctrine and the glory of virtue.

<p>8. In the second place, some trust in their own strength and knowledge
to such an extent that they do not hesitate to give answers to those
questions which demand considerable knowledge of sacred theology and of the
canons. But it is essential for these people, also, to avoid extremes, which are
always evil. For instance, there are some who judge these matters with
such severity that they hold any profit derived from money to be illegal and
usurious; in contrast to them, there are some so indulgent and so remiss
that they hold any gain whatsoever to be free of usury. Let them not
adhere too much to their private opinions. Before they give their answer, let
them consult a number of eminent writers; then let them accept those views
which they understand to be confirmed by knowledge and authority. And if a
dispute should arise, when some contract is discussed, let no insults be
hurled at those who hold the contrary opinion; nor let it be asserted
that it must be severely censured, particularly if it does not lack the
support of reason and of men of reputation. Indeed clamorous outcries and
accusations break the chain of Christian love and give offense and
scandal to the people.

<p>9. In the third place, those who desire to keep themselves free and
untouched by the contamination of usury and to give their money to
another in such a manner that they may receive only legitimate gain should be
admonished to make a contract beforehand. In the contract they should
explain the conditions and what gain they expect from their money. This
will not only greatly help to avoid concern and anxiety, but will also
confirm the contract in the realm of public business. This approach also
closes the door on controversies-which have arisen more than once-since
it clarifies whether the money, which has been loaned without apparent
interest, may actually contain concealed usury.

<p>10. In the fourth place We exhort you not to listen to those who say
that today the issue of usury is present in name only, since gain is almost
always obtained from money given to another. How false is this opinion
and how far removed from the truth! We can easily understand this if we
consider that the nature of one contract differs from the nature of
another. By the same token, the things which result from these contracts
will differ in accordance with the varying nature of the contracts.
Truly an obvious difference exists between gain which arises from money
legally, and therefore can be upheld in the courts of both civil and canon law,
and gain which is illicitly obtained, and must therefore be returned
according to the judgments of both courts. Thus, it is clearly invalid to
suggest,
on the grounds that some gain is usually received from money lent out, that
the issue of usury is irrelevant in our times.

<p>11. These are the chief things We wanted to say to you. We hope that you
may command your faithful to observe what these letters prescribe; and
that you may undertake effective remedies if disturbances should be stirred
up among your people because of this new controversy over usury or if the
simplicity and purity of doctrine should become corrupted in Italy.
Finally, to you and to the flock committed to your care, We impart the
Apostolic Benediction.

<p>Given in Rome at St. Mary Major, November 1, 1745, the sixth year of Our Pontificate.
