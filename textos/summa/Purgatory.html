<h1>Purgatory</h1>

<ol> <li><a href="../summa/7001.htm#article1"> Is there a Purgatory after this life?</a> <li><a href="../summa/7001.htm#article2"> Is it the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned punished?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is a Purgatory after this life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is not a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> after this life. For it is said (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse13">Apocalypse 14:13</a>): "Blessed are the dead who die in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. From henceforth now, saith the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that they may rest from their labors." Therefore after this life no cleansing labor awaits those who die in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, nor those who do not die in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, since they cannot be cleansed. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is to an eternal reward, so is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Now those who die in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are forthwith consigned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>. Therefore those who die in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> go at once to their <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">reward</a>; and consequently no <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> awaits them after this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is supremely merciful is more inclined to reward <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than to punish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now just as those who are in the state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, do certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which are not deserving of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, so those who are in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, at times perform actions, generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which are not deserving of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward. Therefore since these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions are not rewarded after this life in those who will be damned, neither should those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a> be punished after this life. Hence the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (<a href="../bible/2ma012.htm#verse46">2 Maccabees 12:46</a>): "It is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wholesome thought to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>, that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now there is no need to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for they are in no need; nor again for those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because they cannot be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore after this life, there are some not yet loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who can be loosed therefrom; and the like have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, without which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot be loosed, for "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" [<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>]. Hence they will not be consigned to everlasting death, since "he that liveth and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Me, shall not die for ever" [<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse26">John 11:26</a>]: nor will they obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without being cleansed, because nothing unclean shall obtain it, as stated in the last chapter of the Apocalypse (verse 14). Therefore some kind of cleansing remains after this life.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [De iis qui in fide dormiunt] says: "If one who loves and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," has failed to wash away his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in this life, "he is set free after death by the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>." Therefore there remains some kind of cleansing after this life.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From the conclusions we have drawn above (III, 86, 4-5; Supplement, 12, 1) it is sufficiently clear that there is a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> after this life. For if the debt of punishment is not paid in full after the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been washed away by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, nor again are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> always removed when mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, and if <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be set in order by due punishment, it follows that one who after <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> for his fault and after being <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, dies before making due satisfaction, is punished after this life. Wherefore those who deny <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> speak against the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for which reason such a statement is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, after the words quoted above, adds: "This we preach, holding to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this is our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>; this the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds, by <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a> that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." This cannot be understood except as referring to <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>: and whosoever resists the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, incurs the note of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The authority quoted is speaking of the labor of working for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, and not of the labor of suffering to be cleansed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> has not a perfect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but results from each single defect: whereas <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> arises from one perfect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts [Div. Nom. iv, 4]. Hence each defect is an obstacle to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hinders some consummation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since there is never <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> without some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> prevents one who has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from obtaining the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, until he be cleansed; whereas mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be hindered by some conjoined <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from bringing a man forthwith to the extreme of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that falls into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, deadens all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he has done before, and what he does, while in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is dead: since by offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he deserves to lose all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he has from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore no reward after this life awaits him who dies in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas sometimes punishment awaits him who dies in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which does not always wash away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which it finds, but only that which is contrary to it.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned punished?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not the same place where <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are cleansed and the damned punished. For the punishment of the damned is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew 25:46</a>, "These shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'fire']." But the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is temporary, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iv, D, 21). Therefore the former and the latter are not punished together in the same place: and consequently these places must needs be distinct.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> The punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is called by various names, as in <a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse7">Psalm 10:7</a>, "Fire and brimstone, and storms of winds," etc., whereas the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is called by one name only, namely fire. Therefore they are not punished with the same fire and in the same place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says (De Sacram. ii, 16): "It is probable that they are punished in the very places where they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." And <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> relates (Dial. iv, 40) that Germanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, found Paschasius being cleansed in the baths. Therefore they are not cleansed in the same place as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but in this world.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei i, 8)]: "Even as in the same fire gold glistens and straw smokes, so in the same fire the sinner burns and the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> is cleansed." Therefore the fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is the same as the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: and hence they are in the same place.

<p>Further, the holy fathers; before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">coming of Christ</a>, were in a more worthy place than that wherein <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are now cleansed after death, since there was no pain of sense there. Yet that place was joined to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or the same as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: otherwise <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when descending into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">Limbo</a> would not be said to have descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is either close to, or the same place as, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing is clearly stated in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> about the situation of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, nor is it possible to offer convincing arguments on this question. It is probable, however, and more in keeping with the statements of holy men and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> made to many, that there is a twofold place of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. One, according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and thus the place of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is situated below and in proximity to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, so that it is the same fire which torments the damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and cleanses the just in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>; although the damned being lower in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, are to be consigned to a lower place. Another place of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is according to dispensation: and thus sometimes, as we read, some are punished in various places, either that the living may learn, or that the dead may be succored, seeing that their punishment being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the living may be mitigated through the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Some say, however, that according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the place of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This does not seem probable, since a man may be punished at the same time for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in various places. And others say that according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> they are punished above us, because they are between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as regards their state. But this is of no account, for they are not punished for being above us, but for that which is lowest in them, namely <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The fire of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but temporary in its cleansing effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is for the purpose of affliction, wherefore it is called by the names of things that are wont to afflict us here. But the chief purpose of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is to cleanse us from the remains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and consequently the pain of fire only is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, because fire cleanses and consumes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the point of special dispensation and not that of the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.
