<h1>Question 100. Simony</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article1"> What is simony?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article2"> Is it lawful to accept money for the sacraments?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article3"> Is it lawful to accept money for spiritual actions?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article4"> Is it lawful to sell things connected with spirituals?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article5"> Does real remuneration alone make a man guilty of simony, or also oral remuneration or remuneration by service?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3100.htm#article6"> The punishment of simony</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether simony is an intentional will to buy or sell something spiritual or connected with a spiritual thing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that simony is not "an express will to buy or sell something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or connected with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing." Simony is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, since it is written (I, qu. i [Can. Eos qui per pecunias.]): "The impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Macedonius and of those who with him impugned the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is more endurable than that of those who are guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>: since the former in their ravings maintained that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of Father and Son is a creature and the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas the latter make the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be their own <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>. For every master sells what he has just as he wills, whether it be his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> or any other of his possessions." But unbelief, like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is an act not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as shown above (Question 10, Article 2). Therefore simony should not be defined as an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> intentionally is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and this is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore, if simony is an intentional will to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would seem that it is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing is more <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> than the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But it is lawful to buy the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (v, in Ev.): "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is worth as much as you possess." Therefore simony does not consist in a will to buy something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, simony takes its name from Simon the magician, of whom we read (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse18">Acts 8:18-19</a>) that "he offered the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> money" that he might buy a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, in order, to wit, "that on whomsoever he imposed his hand they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." But we do not read that he wished to sell anything. Therefore simony is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to sell a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, there are many other <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> commutations besides buying and selling, such as exchange and transaction [A kind of legal compromise--Oxford Dictionary]. Therefore it would seem that simony is defined insufficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, anything connected with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things is itself <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore it is superfluous to add "or connected with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, according to some, the Pope cannot commit <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>: yet he can buy or sell something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore simony is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to buy or sell something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or connected with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> says (Regist. [Caus. I, qu. i, can. Presbyter, qu. iii, can. Altare]): "None of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that buying or selling altars, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 18, 2) an act is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generically when it bears on undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing is undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for buying and selling for three reasons. First, because a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing cannot be appraised at any earthly price, even as it is said concerning wisdom (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse15">Proverbs 3:15</a>), "she is more precious than all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and all things that are desired, are not to be compared with her": and for this reason Peter, in condemning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of Simon in its very source, said (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts 8:20</a>): "Keep thy money to thyself to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be purchased with money."

<p>Secondly, because a thing cannot be due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for sale if the vendor is not the owner thereof, as appears from the authority quoted (Objection 1). Now ecclesiastical superiors are not owners, but dispensers of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>, "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Thirdly, because sale is opposed to the source of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, since they flow from the gratuitous will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew 10:8</a>): "Freely have you received, freely give."

<p>Therefore by buying or selling a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, a man treats <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and divine things with irreverence, and consequently commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of irreligion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as religion consists in a kind of protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without, sometimes, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being in one's heart, so too the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to religion include a certain protestation of unbelief without, sometimes, unbelief being in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Accordingly simony is said to be a "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>," as regards the outward protestation, since by selling a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> a man declares, in a way, that he is the owner of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>; and this is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. It must, however, be observed that Simon Magus, besides wishing the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to sell him a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for money, said that the world was not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by some heavenly power, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states (Etym. viii, 5): and so for this reason simoniacs are reckoned with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> book on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 58, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, with all its parts, and consequently all the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its subject. Hence simony is fittingly defined from its relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. This act is furthermore described as "express," in order to signify that it proceeds from choice, which takes the principal part in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Nor does everyone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from choice, but only he who chooses <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through contempt of those things whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is wont to be withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 14, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is said to be bought when a man gives what he has for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. But this is to employ the term "buying" in a wide sense, and as synonymous with <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>: nor does it reach to the perfect signification of buying, both because neither "the sufferings of this time," nor any <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of ours, "are worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come, that shall be revealed in us" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a>), and because <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> consists chiefly, not in an outward <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, action or passion, but in an inward affection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Simon the magician wished to buy a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power in order that afterwards he might sell it. For it is written (I, qu. iii [Can. Salvator]), that "Simon the magician wished to buy the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in order that he might make money by selling the signs to be wrought by him." Hence those who sell <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are likened in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to Simon the magician: while those who wish to buy them are likened to him in act. Those who sell them imitate, in act, Giezi the disciple of Eliseus, of whom we read (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse20">2 Kings 5:20-24</a>) that he received money from the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> who was healed: wherefore the sellers of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things may be called not only "simoniacs" but also "giezites."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The terms "buying" and "selling" cover all kinds of non-gratuitous contracts. Wherefore it is impossible for the exchange or agency of prebends or ecclesiastical benefices to be made by authority of the parties concerned without danger of committing simony, as laid down by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [Cap. Quaesitum, de rerum Permutat.; cap. Super, de Transact.]. Nevertheless the superior, in virtue of his office, can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> these exchanges to be made for useful or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> reasons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives by itself, while the body lives through being united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; so, too, certain things are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> by themselves, such as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the like, while others are called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, through adhering to those others. Hence (I, qu. iii, cap. Siquis objecerit) it is stated that "<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things do not progress without corporal things, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has no bodily life without the body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The Pope can be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of simony, like any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since the higher a man's position the more grievous is his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For although the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belong to him as dispenser in chief, they are not his as master and owner. Therefore, were he to accept money from the income of any church in exchange for a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, he would not escape being guilty of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. In like manner he might commit simony by accepting from a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> moneys not belonging to the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is always unlawful to give money for the sacraments?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not always unlawful to give money for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is the door of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as we shall state in the III, 68, 6; III, 73, 3. But seemingly it is lawful in certain cases to give money for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, for instance if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a dying child without being paid. Therefore it is not always unlawful to buy or sell the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the Mass. But some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> receive a prebend or money for singing masses. Much more therefore is it lawful to buy or sell the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sacrament consisting chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. But some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> demand money when absolving from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Therefore it is not always unlawful to buy or sell a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, custom makes that which otherwise were <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to be not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 47) that "it was no crime to have several wives, so long as it was the custom." Now it is the custom in some places to give something in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, blessings of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, ordinations of the clergy, in exchange for the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil, and so forth. Therefore it would seem that it is not unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it happens sometimes that someone maliciously hinders a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from obtaining a bishopric or some like dignity. But it is lawful for a man to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> his grievance. Therefore it is lawful, seemingly, in such a case to give money for a bishopric or a like ecclesiastical dignity.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, marriage is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But sometimes money is given for marriage. Therefore it is lawful to sell a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (I, qu. i [Can. Qui per pecunias]): "Whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> anyone for money, let him be cut off from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are of all things most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, inasmuch as they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, on which no price can be set, and which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> incompatible with a non-gratuitous giving. Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are dispensed through the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whom the people are bound to support, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>), "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not, that they who work in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, eat the things that are of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place; and they that serve the altar, partake with the altar?"

<p>Accordingly we must answer that to receive money for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of simony, which cannot be excused by any custom whatever, since "custom does not prevail over <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>" [Cap. Cum tanto, de Consuetud.; cf. I-II, 97, 3. Now by money we are to understand anything that has a pecuniary value, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iv, 1). On the other hand, to receive anything for the support of those who administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in accordance with the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and approved customs, is not simony, nor is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is received not as a price of goods, but as a payment for their need. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well," says: "They should look to the people for a supply to their need, but to the Lord for the reward of their ministry."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> anyone may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. And since nowise ought one to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> without being paid, one must act as though there were no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> available for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is in charge of the child can, in such a case, lawfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> it, or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by anyone else. He could, however, lawfully buy the water from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because it is merely a bodily element. But if it were an adult in danger of death that wished to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him without being paid, he ought, if possible, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by someone else. And if he is unable to have recourse to another, he must by no means pay a price for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and should rather die without being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because for him the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of desire would supply the lack of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receives money, not as the price for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, or for singing the Mass (for this would be simoniacal), but as payment for his livelihood, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The money exacted of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> is not the price of his <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> (for this would be simoniacal), but a punishment of a past crime for which he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above, "custom does not prevail over <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>" whereby simony is forbidden. Wherefore the custom, if such there be, of demanding anything as the price of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of buying or selling it, is manifestly simoniacal, especially when the demand is made of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unwilling to pay. But if the demand be made in payment of a stipend recognized by custom it is not simoniacal, provided there be no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of buying or selling, but only of doing what is customary, and especially if the demand be acceded to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. On all these cases, however, one must beware of anything having an appearance of simony or avarice, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse22">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>), "From all appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> restrain yourselves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> It would be simoniacal to buy off the opposition of one's rivals, before acquiring the right to a bishopric or any dignity or prebend, by election, appointment or presentation, since this would be to use money as a means of obtaining a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing. But it is lawful to use money as a means of removing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> opposition, after one has already acquired that right.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Some [<a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> on Cap. Cum in Ecclesia, de Simonia] say that it is lawful to give money for Matrimony because no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is conferred thereby. But this is not altogether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as we shall state in the Third Part of the work [Supplement, 42, 3]. Wherefore we must reply that Matrimony is not only a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently it is lawful to give money for Matrimony considered as an office of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but unlawful if it be considered as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> [Cap. Cum in Ecclesia, de Simonia], it is forbidden to demand anything for the Nuptial Blessing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is lawful to give and receive money for spiritual actions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is lawful to give and receive money for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions. The use of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> action. But something used to be given of old for the use of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 9:7-8</a>, and <a href="../bible/1ki014.htm#verse3">1 Kings 14:3</a>. Therefore it would seem that it is lawful to give and receive money for a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, preaching, divine praise, are most <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions. Now money is given to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in order to obtain the assistance of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>, "Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." To preachers also, who sow <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, temporal things are due according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>). Moreover, something is given to those who celebrate the divine praises in the ecclesiastical office, and make processions: and sometimes an annual income is assigned to them. Therefore it is lawful to receive something for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> actions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, science is no less <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> than power. Now it is lawful to receive money for the use of science: thus a lawyer may sell his just advocacy, a physician his advice for health, and a master the exercise of his teaching. Therefore in like manner it would seem lawful for a prelate to receive something for the use of his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, for instance, for correction, dispensation, and so forth.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, religion is the state of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfection. Now in certain monasteries something is demanded from those who are received there. Therefore it is lawful to demand something for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated (I, qu. i [Can. Quidquid invisibilis]): "It is absolutely forbidden to make a charge for what is acquired by the consolation of invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whether by demanding a price or by seeking any kind of return whatever." Now all these <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things are acquired through an invisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it is not lawful to charge a price or return for them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, because they confer a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so, too, certain other things are called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, because they flow from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and dispose thereto. And yet these things are obtainable through the ministry of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>, "Who serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charges? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?" Hence it is simoniacal to sell or buy that which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> in such like actions; but to receive or give something for the support of those who minister <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in accordance with the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and approved customs is lawful, yet in such wise that there be no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of buying or selling, and that no pressure be brought to bear on those who are unwilling to give, by withholding <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things that ought to be administered, for then there would be an appearance of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. But after the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things have been freely bestowed, then the statutory and customary offerings and other dues may be exacted from those who are unwilling but able to pay, if the superior authorize this to be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mic003.htm#verse9">Micah 3:9</a>, certain <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> were freely offered to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for their livelihood, but not as a price for the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of prophecy. Wicked <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, however, abused this exercise by demanding payment for it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the poor in order to obtain from them the assistance of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> do not give with the intent of buying their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; but by their gratuitous beneficence inspire the poor with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them freely and out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Temporal things are due to the preacher as means for his support, not as a price of the words he preaches. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 5:11</a>, "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well," says: "Their need allows them to receive the wherewithal to live, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> demands that this should be given to them: yet the Gospel is not for sale, nor is a livelihood the object of preaching: for if they sell it for this purpose, they sell a great thing for a contemptible price." On like manner temporal things are given to those who praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by celebrating the divine office whether for the living or for the dead, not as a price but as a means of livelihood; and the same purpose is fulfilled when <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are received for making processions in funerals. Yet it is simoniacal to do such things by contract, or with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of buying or selling. Hence it would be an unlawful ordinance if it were decreed in any church that no procession would take place at a funeral unless a certain sum of money were paid, because such an ordinance would preclude the free granting of pious offices to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The ordinance would be more in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, if it were decreed that this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> would be accorded to all who gave a certain <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, because this would not preclude its being granted to others. Moreover, the former ordinance has the appearance of an exaction, whereas the latter bears a likeness to a gratuitous remuneration.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is entrusted is bound by virtue of his office to exercise the power entrusted to him in dispensing <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Moreover, he receives a statutory payment from the funds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a means of livelihood. Therefore, if he were to accept anything for the exercise of his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, this would imply, not a hiring of his labor (which he is bound to give, as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> arising out of the office he has accepted), but a sale of the very use of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For this reason it is unlawful for him to receive anything for any dispensing whatever, or for allowing someone else to take his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, or for correcting his subjects, or for omitting to correct them. On the other hand it is lawful for him to receive "procurations," when he visits his subjects, not as a price for correcting them, but as a means of livelihood. He that is possessed of science, without having taken upon himself the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of using it for the benefit of others can lawfully receive a price for his learning or advice, since this is not a sale of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or science, but a hiring of labor. If, on the other hand, he be so bound by virtue of his office, this would amount to a sale of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and consequently he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> grievously. For instance, those who in certain churches are appointed to instruct the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of that church and other poor <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and are in receipt of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> for so doing, are not allowed to receive anything in return, either for teaching, or for celebrating or omitting any feasts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is unlawful to exact or receive anything as price for entering a monastery: but, in the case of small monasteries, that are unable to support so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it is lawful, while entrance to the monastery is free, to accept something for the support of those who are about to be received into the monastery, if its revenues are insufficient. On like manner it is lawful to be easier in admitting to a monastery a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his regard for that monastery by the generosity of his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: just as, on the other hand, it is lawful to incite a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> regard for a monastery by means of temporal benefits, in order that he may thereby be induced to enter the monastery; although it is unlawful to agree to give or receive something for entrance into a monastery (I, qu. ii, cap. Quam pio).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it is lawful to receive money for things annexed to spiritual things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem lawful to receive money for things annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Seemingly all temporal things are annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, since temporal things ought to be sought for the sake of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. If, therefore, it is unlawful to sell what is annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, it will be unlawful to sell anything temporal, and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing would seem to be more annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things than <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> vessels. Yet it is lawful to sell a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> for the ransom of prisoners, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Offic. ii, 28). Therefore it is lawful to sell things annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things include right of burial, right of patronage, and, according to ancient writers, right of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> (because before the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> exercised the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office), and the right to receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> bought from Ephron a double cave for a burying-place (<a href="../bible/gen023.htm#verse8">Genesis 23:8</a>, sqq.), and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> bought from <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> the right of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse31">Genesis 25:31</a>, sqq.). Again the right of patronage is transferred with the property sold, and is granted "in fee." Tithes are granted to certain soldiers, and can be redeemed. Prelates also at times retain for themselves the revenues of prebends of which they have the presentation, although a prebend is something annexed to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing. Therefore it is lawful to sell things annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Paschal [<a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Paschal II</a>] says (cf. I, qu. iii, cap. Si quis objecerit): "Whoever sells one of two such things, that the one is unproductive without the other, leaves neither unsold. Wherefore let no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sell a church, or a prebend, or anything ecclesiastical."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may be annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in two ways. First, as being dependent on <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Thus to have to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, because it is not competent save to those who hold a clerical office. Hence such things can by no means <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Consequently it is altogether unlawful to sell such things, because the sale thereof implies the sale of things <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Other things are annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things through being directed thereto, for instance the right of patronage, which is directed to the presentation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>; and sacred vessels, which are directed to the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Wherefore such things as these do not presuppose <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, but precede them in the order of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence in a way they can be sold, but not as annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All things temporal are annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, as to their end, wherefore it is lawful to sell temporal things, but their relation to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things cannot be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a lawful sale.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sacred vessels also are annexed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things as to their end, wherefore their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> cannot be sold. Yet their material can be sold for the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of the poor provided they first be broken, after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has been said over them, since when once broken, they are considered to be no longer sacred vessels but mere metal: so that if like vessels were to be made out of the same material they would have to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We have no authority for supposing that the double cave which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> bought for a burial place was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for that purpose: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> could lawfully buy that site to be used for burial, in order to turn it into a sepulchre: even so it would be lawful now to buy an ordinary field as a site for a cemetery or even a church. Nevertheless because even among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> burial places are looked upon as religious, if Ephron intended to accept the price as payment for a burial place, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in selling, though <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in buying, because he intended merely to buy an ordinary plot of ground. Even now, it is lawful in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to sell or buy land on which there has previously been a church, as we have also said with regard to sacred vessels (Reply to Objection[2). Or again, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is to be excused because he thus freed himself of a grievance. For although Ephron offered him the burial place for nothing, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> deemed that he could not accept it gratis without prejudice to himself.

<p>The right of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> was due to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> choice, according to <a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse2">Malachi 1:2-3</a>, "I have loved <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, but have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by selling his birthright, yet <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not in buying, because he is understood to have freed himself of his grievance.

<p>The right of patronage cannot be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a direct sale, nor can it be granted "in fee," but is transferred with the property sold or granted.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> right of receiving <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is not granted to layfolk, but merely the temporal commodities which are granted in the name of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, as stated above (Question 87, Article 3).

<p>With regard to the granting of benefices it must, however, be observed, that it is not unlawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, before presenting a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to a benefice, to decide, for some reason, to retain part of the revenues of the benefice in question, and to spend it on some pious object. But, on the other hand, if he were to require part of the revenues of that benefice to be given to him by the beneficiary, it would be the same as though he demanded payment from him, and he would not escape the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful to grant <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in return for an equivalent of service, or an oral remuneration. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. iii, ep. 18): "It is right that those who serve the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be rewarded." Now an equivalent of service denotes serving the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore it seems lawful to confer ecclesiastical benefices for services received.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to confer an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> for service received seems to indicate a carnal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, no less than to do so on account of kinship. Yet the latter seemingly is not simoniacal since it implies no buying or selling. Therefore neither is the former simoniacal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is done only at another's request would seem to be done gratis: so that apparently it does not involve simony, which consists in buying or selling. Now oral remuneration denotes the conferring of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> at some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> request. Therefore this is not simoniacal.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> perform <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in order that they may receive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, which seems to imply oral remuneration: and yet <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> are not said to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Therefore oral remuneration does not entail <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Urban [Urban II, Ep. xvii ad Lucium] says: "Whoever grants or acquires ecclesiastical things, not for the purpose for which they were instituted but for his own profit, in consideration of an oral remuneration or of an equivalent in service rendered or money received, is guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the term "money" denotes "anything that can have a pecuniary value." Now it is evident that a man's service is directed to some kind of usefulness, which has a pecuniary value, wherefore servants are hired for a money wage. Therefore to grant a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing for a service rendered or to be rendered is the same as to grant it for the money, received or promised, at which that service could be valued. If likewise, to grant a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> request for the bestowal of a temporary favor is directed to some kind of usefulness which has a pecuniary value. Wherefore just as a man contracts the guilt of simony by accepting money or any <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> thing which comes under the head of "real remuneration," so too does he contract it, by receiving "oral remuneration" or an "equivalent in service rendered."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> renders a prelate a lawful service, directed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things (e.g. to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or benefit of her ministers), he becomes worthy of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> by reason of the devotion that led him to render the service, as he would by reason of any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Hence this is not a case of remuneration for service rendered, such as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> has in mind. But if the service be unlawful, or directed to carnal things (e.g. a service rendered to the prelate for the profit of his kindred, or the increase of his patrimony, or the like), it will be a case of remuneration for service rendered, and this will be <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The bestowal of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing gratis on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by reason of kinship or of any carnal affection is unlawful and carnal, but not simoniacal: since nothing is received in return, wherefore it does not imply a contract of buying and selling, on which simony is based. But to present a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> with the understanding or <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> that he provide for one's kindred from the revenue is manifest <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Oral remuneration denotes either praise that pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favor, which has its price, or a request whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> favor is obtained or the contrary avoided. Hence if one intend this chiefly one commits <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Now to grant a request made for an unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> implies, seemingly, that this is one's chief <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> itself is simoniacal. But if the request be made for a worthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> itself is not simoniacal, because it is based on a worthy <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, on account of which a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing is granted to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom the request is made. Nevertheless there may be simony in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, if one look, not to the worthiness of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favor. If, however, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> asks for himself, that he may obtain the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, his very presumption renders him unworthy, and so his request is made for an unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But, if one be in need, one may lawfully seek for oneself an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> without the cure of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A hypocrite does not give a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing for the sake of praise, he only makes a show of it, and under <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> pretenses stealthily purloins rather than buys <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise: so that seemingly the hypocrite is not guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether those who are guilty of simony are fittingly punished by being deprived of what they have acquired by simony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that those who are guilty of simony are not fittingly punished by being deprived of what they have acquired by simony. Simony is committed by acquiring <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in return for a remuneration. Now certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things cannot be lost when once acquired, such as all characters that are imprinted by a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Therefore it is not a fitting punishment for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be deprived of what he has acquired simoniacally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it sometimes happens that one who has obtained the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> by simony commands a subject of his to receive orders from him: and apparently the subject should obey, so long as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> tolerates him. Yet no one ought to receive from him that has not the power to give. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not lose his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> power, if he has acquired it by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one should be punished for what was done without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and consent, since punishment is due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 74, 1 and 2; I-II, 77, 7). Now it happens sometimes that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> acquires something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, which others have procured for him without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and consent. Therefore he should not be punished by being deprived of what has been bestowed on him.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no one should profit by his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet, if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has acquired an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> by simony, were to restore what he has received, this would sometimes turn to the profit of those who had a share in his <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; for instance, when a prelate and his entire chapter have consented to the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Therefore that which has been acquired by simony ought not always to be restored.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> obtains admission to a monastery by simony, and there takes the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of profession. But no one should be freed from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> on account of a fault he has committed. Therefore he should not be expelled from the monastic state which he has acquired by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, in this world external punishment is not inflicted for the internal movements of the heart, whereof <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the judge. Now simony is committed in the mere <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> or will, wherefore it is defined in reference to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should not always be deprived of what he has acquired by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, to be promoted to greater dignity is much less than to retain that which one has already received. Now sometimes those who are guilty of simony are, by dispensation, promoted to greater dignity. Therefore they should not always be deprived of what they have received.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (I, qu. i, cap. Si quis Episcopus): "He that has been ordained shall profit nothing from his ordination or promotion that he has acquired by the bargain, but shall forfeit the dignity or cure that he has acquired with his money."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No one can lawfully retain that which he has acquired against the owner's will. For instance, if a steward were to give some of his lord's property to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, against his lord's will and orders, the recipient could not lawfully retain what he received. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, Whose stewards and ministers are the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of churches, ordered <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things to be given gratis, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew 10:8</a>, "Freely have you received, freely give." Wherefore whosoever acquires <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things in return for a remuneration cannot lawfully retain them. Moreover, those who are guilty of simony, by either selling or buying <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, as well as those who act as go-between, are sentenced to other punishments, namely, infamy and deposition, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> if they be laymen, as stated qu. i, cap. Si quis Episcopus [Qu. iii, can. Si quis praebendas].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He that has received a sacred Order simoniacally, receives the character of the Order on account of the efficacy of the sacrament: but he does not receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor the exercise of the Order, because he has received the character by stealth as it were, and against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Supreme Lord. Wherefore he is suspended, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, both as regards himself, namely, that he should not busy himself about exercising his Order, and as regards others, namely, that no one may communicate with him in the exercise of his Order, whether his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be public or secret. Nor may he reclaim the money which he basely gave, although the other party <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> retains it.

<p>Again, a man who is guilty of simony, through having conferred Orders simoniacally, or through having simoniacally granted or received a benefice, or through having been a go-between in a simoniacal transaction, if he has done so publicly, is suspended by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as regards both himself and others; but if he has acted in secret he is suspended by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as regards himself alone, and not as regards others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One ought not to receive Orders from a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to have been promoted simoniacally, either on account of his command or for fear of his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>: and such as receive Orders from him do not receive the exercise of their Orders, even though they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his being guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; and they need to receive a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Some, however, maintain that one ought to receive Orders in obedience to his command unless one can <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> him to be guilty of simony, but that one ought not to exercise the Order without a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. But this is an unreasonable statement, because no one should obey a man to the extent of communicating with him in an unlawful action. Now he that is, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, suspended as regards both himself and others, confers Orders unlawfully: wherefore no one should communicate with him, by receiving Orders from him for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever. If, however, one be not certain on the point, one ought not to give credence to another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so one ought with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to receive Orders from him. And if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been guilty of simony otherwise than by a simoniacal promotion, and the fact be a secret, one can receive Orders from him because he is not suspended as regards others, but only as regards himself, as stated above (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be deprived of what one has received is not only the punishment of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is also sometimes the effect of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, as when one buys a thing of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who cannot sell it. Wherefore if a man, knowingly and spontaneously, receives Orders or an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> simoniacally, not only is he deprived of what he has received, by forfeiting the exercise of his order, and resigning the benefice and the fruits acquired therefrom, but also in addition to this he is punished by being marked with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. Moreover, he is bound to restore not only the fruit actually acquired, but also such as could have been acquired by a careful possessor (which, however, is to be understood of the net fruits, allowance being made for expenses incurred on account of the fruits), excepting those fruits that have been expended for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>On the other hand, if a man's promotion be procured simoniacally by others, without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and consent, he forfeits the exercise of his Order, and is bound to resign the benefice obtained together with fruits still extant; but he is not bound to restore the fruits which he has consumed, since he possessed them in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Exception must be made in the case when his promotion has been deceitfully procured by an enemy of his; or when he expressly opposes the transaction, for then he is not bound to resign, unless subsequently he agree to the transaction, by paying what was promised.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Money, property, or fruits simoniacally received, must be restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that has incurred loss by their transfer, notwithstanding the fact that the prelate or a member of the chapter of that church was at fault, since others ought not to be the losers by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: in suchwise, however, that, as far as possible, the guilty parties be not the gainers. But if the prelate and the entire chapter be at fault, restitution must be made, with the consent of superior authority, either to the poor or to some other church.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> If there are any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have been simoniacally admitted into a monastery, they must quit: and if the simony was committed with their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> since the holding of the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">General Council</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>, A.D. 1215, held by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a></span>, they must be expelled from their monastery without hope of return, and do perpetual penance under a stricter rule, or in some house of the same order, if a stricter one be not found. If, however, this took place before the Council, they must be placed in other houses of the same order. If this cannot be done, they must be received into monasteries of the same order, by way of compensation, lest they wander about the world, but they must not be admitted to their former rank, and must be assigned a lower place.

<p>On the other hand, if they were received simoniacally, without their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether before or after the Council, then after quitting they may be received again, their rank being changed as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight the mere will makes a man guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; but as regards the external ecclesiastical punishment he is not punished as a simoniac, by being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign, but is bound to repent of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The Pope alone can grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to one who has knowingly received a benefice (simoniacally). On other cases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also can dispense, provided the beneficiary first of all renounce what he has received simoniacally, so that he will receive either the lesser dispensation allowing him to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, or a greater dispensation, allowing him after doing penance to retain his order in some other Church; or again a greater dispensation, allowing him to remain in the same Church, but in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>; or a full dispensation allowing him to exercise even the major orders in the same Church, but not to accept a prelacy.
