<h1>Question 100. The condition of the offspring as regards righteousness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1100.htm#article1"> Would men have been born in a state of righteousness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1100.htm#article2"> Would they have been born confirmed in righteousness?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether men would have been born in a state of righteousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence men would not have been born in a state of righteousness. For <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> says (De Sacram. i): "Before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have begotten children sinless; but not heirs to their father's righteousness."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, righteousness is effected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse16">Romans 5:16-21</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not transfused from one to another, for thus it would be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>; but is infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore children would not have been born righteous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, righteousness is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not transmitted from the parent. Therefore neither would righteousness have been transmitted from parents, to the children.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Concep. Virg. x): "As long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he would have begotten children endowed with righteousness together with the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> begets a specific likeness to himself. Hence whatever <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> result from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, must be alike in parent and child, unless <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fails in its operation, which would not have occurred in the state of innocence. But <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> do not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> alike in parent and child. Now original righteousness, in which the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, was an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is clear from the fact that opposites are of the same genus; and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which is opposed to original righteousness, is called the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore it is transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and for this reason also, the children would have been assimilated to their parents as regards original righteousness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of Hugh are to be understood as referring, not to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of righteousness, but to the execution of the act thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some say that children would have been born, not with the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but with original righteousness. But since the root of original righteousness, which conferred righteousness on the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he was made, consists in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> subjection of the reason to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which subjection results from <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, as above explained (95, 1), we must conclude that if children were born in original righteousness, they would also have been born in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; thus we have said above that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (95, 1). This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, however, would not have been <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, for it would not have been transfused by virtue of the semen; but would have been conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately on his receiving a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In the same way the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is not transmitted by the parent, is infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as soon as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is apt to receive it.

<p>From this the reply to the third objection is clear.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv) on the words of <a href="../bible/job003.htm#verse13">Job 3:13</a>: "For now I should have been asleep, etc.: If no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> corruption had infected our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, he would not have begotten "children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>"; no children would have been born of him but such as were destined to be saved by the Redeemer." Therefore all would have been born confirmed in righteousness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Cur Deus Homo i, 18): "If our first parents had lived so as not to yield to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, they would have been confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so that with their offspring they would have been unable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any more." Therefore the children would have been born confirmed in righteousness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is stronger than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there resulted, in those born of him, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, if the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had persevered in righteousness, his descendants would have derived from him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of preserving righteousness.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the others <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, were at once confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so as to be unable henceforth to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In like manner, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been confirmed in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> if he had persevered. But he would have begotten children like himself. Therefore they also would have been born confirmed in righteousness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): "Happy would have been the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> if neither they--that is our first parents--had committed any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be transmitted to their descendants, nor any of their race had committed any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which they would have been condemned." From which words we gather that even if our first parents had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, any of their descendants might have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and therefore they would not have been born confirmed in righteousness.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It does not seem possible that in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For it is clear that at their birth they would not have had greater perfection than their parents at the time of begetting. Now the parents, as long as they begot children, would not have been confirmed in righteousness. For the rational creature is confirmed in righteousness through the beatitude given by the clear <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>; and when once it has seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it cannot but cleave to Him Who is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, wherefrom no one can turn away, since nothing is desired or loved but under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. I say this according to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; for it may be otherwise in the case of special privilege, such as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> was granted to the Virgin Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And as soon as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had attained to that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Essence, he would have become <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; and his animal life would have ceased, wherein alone there is generation. Hence it is clear that children would not have been born confirmed in righteousness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he would not have begotten "children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" in the sense that they would contract from him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: yet by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> they could have become "children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." If, however, they did not become "children of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>" by falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this would not have been owing to their being confirmed in righteousness, but to Divine Providence preserving them free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> does not say this by way of assertion, but only as an opinion, which is clear from his mode of expression as follows: "It seems that if they had lived, etc."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument is not conclusive, though <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> seems to have been influenced by it, as appears from his words above quoted. For the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> incurred by the descendants would not have been such that they could not return to righteousness, which is the case only with the damned. Wherefore neither would the parents have transmitted to their descendants the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, which is only in the blessed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is no comparison between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is changeable, both before and after choice; whereas the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> is not changeable, as we have said above in treating of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (64, 2).
