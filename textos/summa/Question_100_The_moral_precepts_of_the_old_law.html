<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all the moral precepts of the Old Law belong to the law of nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all the moral precepts belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse9">Sirach 17:9</a>): "Moreover He gave them instructions, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of life for an inheritance." But instruction is in contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not learnt, but instilled by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. Therefore not all the moral precepts belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is more perfect than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> adds certain things concerning <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals, to those that belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: as is evidenced by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is the same in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, while these moral institutions are various for various people. Much more reason therefore was there why the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> should add to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, ordinances pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> leads to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals in certain matters, so does <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> "worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not included in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; since that which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore not all the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have not the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>": which must be understood of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals. Therefore all the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The moral precepts, distinct from the ceremonial and judicial precepts, are about things pertaining of their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals. Now since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> morals depend on their relation to reason, which is the proper principle of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, those morals are called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which accord with reason, and those are called bad which are discordant from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And as every judgment of speculative reason proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of first principles, so every judgment of practical reason proceeds from principles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as stated above (94, A2,4): from which principles one may proceed in various ways to judge of various matters. For some matters connected with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are so evident, that after very little consideration one is able at once to approve or disapprove of them by means of these general first principles: while some matters cannot be the subject of judgment without much consideration of the various circumstances, which all are not competent to do carefully, but only those who are wise: just as it is not possible for all to consider the particular conclusions of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but only for those who are versed in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: and lastly there are some matters of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot judge unless he be helped by Divine instruction; such as the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>.

<p>It is therefore evident that since the moral precepts are about matters which concern <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals; and since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals are those which are in accord with reason; and since also every judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> must needs by derived in some way from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; it follows, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, that all the moral precepts belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but not all in the same way. For there are certain things which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of its own accord and at once, judges to be done or not to be done: e.g. "Honor thy father and thy mother," and "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal": and these belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> absolutely. And there are certain things which, after a more careful consideration, wise men deem obligatory. Such belong to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet so that they need to be inculcated, the wiser teaching the less wise: e.g. "Rise up before the hoary head, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the aged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and the like. And there are some things, to judge of which, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> needs Divine instruction, whereby we are taught about the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: e.g. "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything; Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain."

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the moral precepts of the Law are about all the acts of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are not about all the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For observance of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is called <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse8">Psalm 118:8</a>: "I will keep Thy justifications." But justification is the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the moral precepts are only about acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which comes under a precept has the character of a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. But the character of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> alone and to none of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for the proper act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in rendering to each one his due. Therefore the precepts of the moral <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are not about the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only about the acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is made for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 21). But of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> alone regards the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1). Therefore the moral precepts are only about the acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Paradiso viii) that "a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and a disobedience to the commandments of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But there are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> contrary to all the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to direct all the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2), the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> must needs be diversified according to the various kinds of community: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. iv, 1) teaches that the laws which are made in a state which is ruled by a king must be different from the laws of a state which is ruled by the people, or by a few powerful men in the state. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained for one kind of community, and the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> for another kind. Because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is ordained for the civil community, implying mutual duties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and his fellows: and men are ordained to one another by outward acts, whereby men live in communion with one another. This life in common of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whose proper function consists in directing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> community. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> makes precepts only about acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and if it commands acts of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, this is only in so far as they assume the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. v, 1).

<p>But the community for which the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is ordained, is that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either in this life or in the life to come. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> proposes precepts about all those matters whereby men are well ordered in their relations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or mind, in which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> proposes precepts about all those matters whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is well ordered. But this is effected by the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> set in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order the acts of the reason in themselves: while the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> set in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order the acts of the reason in reference to the interior <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and exterior actions. It is therefore evident that the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> fittingly proposes precepts about the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: yet so that certain matters, without which the order of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, cannot even <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, come under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of precept; while other matters, which pertain to the well-being of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, come under an admonition of counsel.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The fulfilment of the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, even of those which are about the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, has the character of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, inasmuch as it is just that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: or again, inasmuch as it is just that all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Justice properly so called regards the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another: but all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> regard the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the lower powers to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. It is in relation to this latter <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks (Ethic. v, 11) of a kind of metaphorical <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said about the different kinds of community.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all the moral precepts of the Old Law are reducible to the ten precepts of the decalogue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> are reducible to the ten precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. For the first and principal precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," and "Thou shalt love thy neighbor," as stated in <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37-39</a>. But these two are not contained in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Therefore not all the moral precepts are contained in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the moral precepts are not reducible to the ceremonial precepts, but rather vice versa. But among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, one is ceremonial, viz. "Remember that thou keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>." Therefore the moral precepts are not reducible to all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the moral precepts are about all the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are only such as regard acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; as may be seen by going through them all. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> do not include all the moral precepts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew 5:11</a>: "Blessed are ye when they shall revile you," etc. says that "<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, after propounding the ten precepts, set them out in detail." Therefore all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are so many parts of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> differ from the other precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, in the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is said to have given the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>; whereas He gave the other precepts to the people through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> includes those precepts the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such are those which with but slight reflection can be gathered at once from the first general principles: and those also which become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately through divinely infused <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently two kinds of precepts are not reckoned among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: viz. first general principles, for they need no further promulgation after being once imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to which they are self-evident; as, for instance, that one should do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and other similar principles: and again those which the careful reflection of wise men shows to be in accord with reason; since the people receive these principles from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through being taught by wise men. Nevertheless both kinds of precepts are contained in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>; yet in different ways. For the first general principles are contained in them, as principles in their proximate conclusions; while those which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through wise men are contained, conversely, as conclusions in their principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those two principles are the first general principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and are self-evident to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, either through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are referred to these, as conclusions to general principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precept of the Sabbath observance is moral in one respect, in so far as it commands <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to give some time to the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa045.htm#verse11">Psalm 45:11</a>: "Be still and see that I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." In this respect it is placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: but not as to the fixing of the time, in which respect it is a ceremonial precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is not so patent in the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as it is in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence the precepts about the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not so well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the people as are the precepts about acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore the acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> especially come under the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, which are the primary elements of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the precepts of the decalogue are suitably distinguished from one another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unsuitably distinguished from one another. For worship is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now the precepts are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But that which is said at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," belongs to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and that which is added, "Thou shalt not make . . . any graven thing," etc. belongs to worship. Therefore these are not one precept, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> asserts (Qq. in Exod. qu. lxxi), but two.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the affirmative precepts in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are distinct from the negative precepts; e.g. "Honor thy father and thy mother," and, "Thou shalt not kill." But this, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," is affirmative: and that which follows, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," is negative. Therefore these are two precepts, and do not, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. in Exod. qu. lxxi), make one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans 7:7</a>): "I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not say: 'Thou shalt not covet.'" Hence it seems that this precept, "Thou shalt not covet," is one precept; and, therefore, should not be divided into two.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> who, in commenting on Exodus (Qq. in Exod. qu. lxxi) distinguishes three precepts as referring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seven as referring to our neighbor.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are differently divided by different authorities. For Hesychius commenting on <a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse26">Leviticus 26:26</a>, "Ten <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall bake your bread in one oven," says that the precept of the Sabbath-day observance is not one of the ten precepts, because its observance, in the letter, is not binding for all time. But he distinguishes four precepts pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first being, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>"; the second, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," (thus also <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> distinguishes these two precepts, in his commentary on <a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse10">Hosea 10:10</a>, "On thy" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: "their"] "two iniquities"); the third precept according to him is, "Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven thing"; and the fourth, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain." He states that there are six precepts pertaining to our neighbor; the first, "Honor thy father and thy mother"; the second, "Thou shalt not kill"; the third, "Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>"; the fourth, "Thou shalt not steal"; the fifth, "Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness"; the sixth, "Thou shalt not covet."

<p>But, in the first place, it seems unbecoming for the precept of the Sabbath-day observance to be put among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, if it nowise belonged to the decalogue. Secondly, because, since it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew 6:24</a>), "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can serve two masters," the two statements, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," and, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me" seem to be of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to form one precept. Hence <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. viii in Exod.) who also distinguishes four precepts as referring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unites these two under one precept; and reckons in the second place, "Thou shalt not make . . . any graven thing"; as third, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain"; and as fourth, "Remember that thou keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>." The other six he reckons in the same way as Hesychius.

<p>Since, however, the making of graven things or the likeness of anything is not forbidden except as to the point of their being worshipped as gods--for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded an image of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>] to be made and placed in the tabernacle, as related in <a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse18">Exodus 25:18</a>--<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> more fittingly unites these two, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," and, "Thou shalt not make . . . any graven thing," into one precept. Likewise to covet another's wife, for the purpose of carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh; whereas, to covet other things, which are desired for the purpose of possession, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> reckons as distinct precepts, that which forbids the coveting of another's goods, and that which prohibits the coveting of another's wife. Thus he distinguishes three precepts as referring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seven as referring to our neighbor. And this is better.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Worship is merely a declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: wherefore the precepts about worship should not be reckoned as distinct from those about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nevertheless precepts should be given about worship rather than about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the precept about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is presupposed to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as is also the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For just as the first general principles of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> are self-evident to a subject having <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and need no promulgation; so also to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a first and self-evident principle to a subject possessed of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: "for he that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is" (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>). Hence it needs no other promulgation that the infusion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The affirmative precepts are distinct from the negative, when one is not comprised in the other: thus that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> his parents does not include that he should not kill another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor does the latter include the former. But when an affirmative precept is included in a negative, or vice versa, we do not find that two distinct precepts are given: thus there is not one precept saying that "Thou shalt not steal," and another binding one to keep another's property intact, or to give it back to its owner. In the same way there are not different precepts about <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and about not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in strange gods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> has one common ratio: and therefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks of the commandment about <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as though it were one. But because there are various special kinds of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, therefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> distinguishes different prohibitions against coveting: for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> differs specifically in respect of the diversity of actions or things <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 5).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the precepts of the decalogue are suitably set forth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unsuitably set forth. Because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Paradiso viii), is "a transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and a disobedience to the commandments of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are distinguished according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or his neighbor, or himself. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> does not include any precepts directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to himself, but only such as direct him in his relations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and himself, it seems that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the Sabbath-day observance pertained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also did the observance of other solemnities, and the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contains a precept about the Sabbath-day observance. Therefore it should contain others also, pertaining to the other solemnities, and to the sacrificial rite.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> include the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of perjury, so also do they include <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, or other ways of lying against the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But there is a precept forbidding perjury, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain." Therefore there should be also a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> forbidding <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affection for his parents, so has he also for his children. Moreover the commandment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> extends to all our neighbors. Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are ordained unto <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>: "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore as there is a precept referring to parents, so should there have been some precepts referring to children and other neighbors.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is possible to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in thought or in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. But in some kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely in <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, when it is said, "Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, Thou shalt not steal," is distinct from the prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought, when it is said, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods," and, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife." Therefore the same should have been done in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of homicide and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> happens through disorder of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, so does it arise through disorder of the irascible part. But some precepts forbid inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, when it is said, "Thou shalt not covet." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should have included some precepts forbidding the disorders of the irascible faculty. Therefore it seems that the ten precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unfittingly enumerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>): "He shewed you His covenant, which He commanded you to do, and the ten words that He wrote in two tablets of stone."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), just as the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> community, so the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to a community or commonwealth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now in order that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may dwell aright in a community, two things are required: the first is that he behave well to the head of the community; the other is that he behave well to those who are his fellows and partners in the community. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> should contain in the first place precepts ordering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in the second place, other precepts ordering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to other men who are his neighbors and live with him under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes three things to the head of the community: first, fidelity; secondly, reverence; thirdly, service. Fidelity to his master consists in his not giving sovereign <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to another: and this is the sense of the first commandment, in the words "Thou shalt not have strange gods." Reverence to his master requires that he should do nothing injurious to him: and this is conveyed by the second commandment, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain." Service is due to the master in return for the benefits which his subjects receive from him: and to this belongs the third commandment of the sanctification of the Sabbath in memory of the creation of all things.

<p>To his neighbors a man behaves himself well both in particular and in general. In particular, as to those to whom he is indebted, by paying his debts: and in this sense is to be taken the commandment about honoring one's parents. In general, as to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by doing harm to none, either by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, or by word, or by thought. By <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, harm is done to one's neighbor--sometimes in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, i.e. as to his personal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and this is forbidden by the words, "Thou shalt not kill": sometimes in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> united to him, as to the propagation of offspring; and this is prohibited by the words, "Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>": sometimes in his possessions, which are directed to both the aforesaid; and with this regard to this it is said, "Thou shalt not steal." Harm done by word is forbidden when it is said, "Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against thy neighbor": harm done by thought is forbidden in the words, "Thou shalt not covet."

<p>The three precepts that direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his behavior towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may also be differentiated in this same way. For the first refers to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; wherefore it is said, "Thou shalt not make . . . a graven thing": the second, to words; wherefore it is said, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain": the third, to thoughts; because the sanctification of the Sabbath, as the subject of a moral precept, requires repose of the heart in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (In Ps. 32: Conc. 1), by the first commandment we reverence the unity of the First Principle; by the second, the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; by the third, His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> whereby we are sanctified, and wherein we rest as in our last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection may be answered in two ways. First, because the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> can be reduced to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now there was need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to receive a precept about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor, because in this respect the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> had become obscured on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but not about the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> oneself, because in this respect the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> retained its vigor: or again, because love of oneself is contained in the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of one's neighbor: since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> self-love consists in directing oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And for this reason the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> includes those precepts only which refer to our neighbor and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, it may be answered that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are those which the people received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>): "He wrote in the tables, according as He had written before, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you." Hence the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> need to be such as the people can understand at once. Now a precept implies the notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. But it is easy for a man, especially for a believer, to understand that, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, he owes certain duties to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to his neighbor. But that, in matters which regard himself and not another, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, certain duties to himself, is not so evident: for, at the first glance, it seems that everyone is free in matters that concern himself. And therefore the precepts which prohibit disorders of a man with regard to himself, reach the people through the instruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are versed through the instruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are versed in such matters; and, consequently, they are not contained in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All the solemnities of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were instituted in celebration of some Divine favor, either in memory of past favors, or in sign of some favor to come: in like manner all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered up with the same purpose. Now of all the Divine favors to be commemorated the chief was that of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a>, which was called to mind by the sanctification of the Sabbath; wherefore the reason for this precept is given in <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse11">Exodus 20:11</a>: "In six days the Lord made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," etc. And of all future blessings, the chief and final was the repose of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either, in the present life, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or, in the future life, by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; which repose was also foreshadowed in the Sabbath-day observance: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse13">Isaiah 58:13</a>): "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own will in My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day, and call the Sabbath delightful, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>." Because these favors first and chiefly are borne in mind by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially by the faithful. But other solemnities were celebrated on account of certain particular favors temporal and transitory, such as the celebration of the Passover in memory of the past favor of the delivery from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and as a sign of the future <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, which though temporal and transitory, brought us to the repose of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> Sabbath. Consequently, the Sabbath alone, and none of the other solemnities and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, is mentioned in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse16">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "men swear by one greater than themselves; and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> for confirmation is the end of all their controversy." Hence, since oaths are common to all, inordinate swearing is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a special prohibition by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. According to one interpretation, however, the words, "Thou shalt not take the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in vain," are a prohibition of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine, for one <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds them thus: "Thou shalt not say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> That a man should not do harm to anyone is an immediate dictate of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: and therefore the precepts that forbid the doing of harm are binding on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But it is not an immediate dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that a man should do one thing in return for another, unless he happen to be indebted to someone. Now a son's debt to his father is so evident that one cannot get away from it by denying it: since the father is the principle of generation and being, and also of upbringing and teaching. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> does not prescribe <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of kindness or service to be done to anyone except to one's parents. On the other hand parents do not seem to be indebted to their children for any favors received, but rather the reverse is the case. Again, a child is a part of his father; and "parents love their children as being a part of themselves," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 12). Hence, just as the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contains no ordinance as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> behavior towards himself, so, for the same reason, it includes no precept about <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> one's children.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The pleasure of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and the usefulness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, in so far as they have the character of pleasurable or useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, are of themselves, objects of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: and for this reason they needed to be forbidden not only in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> but also in the desire. But <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and falsehood are, of themselves, objects of repulsion (since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to love his neighbor and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>): and are desired only for the sake of something else. Consequently with regard to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to proscribe, not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought, but only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As stated above (Question 25, Article 1), all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible faculty arise from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part. Hence, as the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are, as it were, the first elements of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, there was no need for mention of the irascible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but only of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the ten precepts of the decalogue are set in proper order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ten precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are not set in proper order. Because love of one's neighbor is seemingly previous to love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since our neighbor is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is; according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse20">1 John 4:20</a>: "He that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom he seeth not?" But the first three precepts belong to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the other seven pertain to the love of our neighbor. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are not set in proper order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are prescribed by the affirmative precepts, and acts of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are forbidden by the negative precepts. But according to <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> in his commentary on the Categories [Lib. iv, cap. De Oppos.], <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> should be uprooted before <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are sown. Therefore among the precepts concerning our neighbor, the negative precepts should have preceded the affirmative.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are about men's actions. But actions of thought precede actions of word or outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Therefore the precepts about not coveting, which regard our thoughts, are unsuitably placed last in order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>): "The things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are well ordered" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>']. But the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> were given immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore they are arranged in becoming order.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (3,5, ad 1), the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are such as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ready to grasp at once. Now it is evident that a thing is so much the more easily grasped by the reason, as its contrary is more grievous and repugnant to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Moreover, it is clear, since the order of reason begins with the end, that, for a man to be inordinately disposed towards his end, is supremely contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life and society is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, first of all, to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since the contrary to this is most grievous. Thus also, in an army, which is ordained to the commander as to its end, it is requisite first that the soldier should be subject to the commander, and the opposite of this is most grievous; and secondly it is requisite that he should be in coordination with the other soldiers.

<p>Now among those things whereby we are ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be subjected to Him faithfully, by having nothing in common with His enemies. The second is that he should show Him reverence: the third that he should offer Him service. Thus, in an army, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a soldier to act treacherously and make a compact with the foe, than to be insolent to his commander: and this last is more grievous than if he be found wanting in some point of service to him.

<p>As to the precepts that direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his behavior towards his neighbor, it is evident that it is more repugnant to reason, and a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not observe the due order as to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom he is most indebted. Consequently, among those precepts that direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relations to his neighbor, the first place is given to that one which regards his parents. Among the other precepts we again find the order to be according to the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is more grave and more repugnant to reason, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> than by word; and by word than by thought. And among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> which destroys life in one already living is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which imperils the life of the unborn child; and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is more grave than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, which regards external goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although our neighbor is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the way of the senses, nevertheless the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the reason for the love of our neighbor, as shall be declared later on (II-II, 25, 1; II-II, 26, 2). Hence the precepts ordaining <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> demanded precedence of the others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal principle of being in respect of all things, so is a father a principle of being in respect of his son. Therefore the precept regarding parents was fittingly placed after the precepts regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This argument holds in respect of affirmative and negative precepts about the same kind of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: although even then it is not altogether cogent. For although in the order of execution, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> should be uprooted before <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are sown, according to <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse15">Psalm 33:15</a>: "Turn away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," and <a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>: "Cease to do perversely; learn to do well"; yet, in the order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, because "the crooked line is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the straight" (De Anima i): and "by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans 3:20</a>). Wherefore the affirmation precept demanded the first place. However, this is not the reason for the order, but that which is given above. Because in the precepts regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which belongs to the first table, an affirmative precept is placed last, since its transgression implies a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of thought stands first in the order of execution, yet its prohibition holds a later position in the order of reason.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the precepts of the decalogue are suitably formulated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unsuitably formulated. Because the affirmative precepts direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while the negative precepts withdraw him from acts of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But in every <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to one another. Therefore in whatever <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there is an ordinance of a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, there should have been an affirmative and a negative precept. Therefore it was unfitting that affirmative precepts should be framed in some matters, and negative precepts in others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. ii, 10) that every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is based on reason. But all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Therefore the reason should have been pointed out in each precept, and not only in the first and third.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by observing the precepts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves to be rewarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the Divine promises concern the rewards of the precepts. Therefore the promise should have been included in each precept, and not only in the second and fourth.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is called "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of fear," in so far as it induced men to observe the precepts, by means of the threat of punishments. But all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore a threat of punishment should have been included in each, and not only in the first and second.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be retained in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse3">Proverbs 3:3</a>): "Write them in the tables of thy heart." Therefore it was not fitting that mention of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> should be made in the third commandment only. Consequently it seems that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unsuitably formulated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things, in measure, number and weight." Much more therefore did He observe a suitable manner in formulating His Law.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The highest wisdom is contained in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>): "This is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Now it belongs to wisdom to arrange all things in due manner and order. Therefore it must be evident that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are suitably set forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Affirmation of one thing always leads to the denial of its opposite: but the denial of one opposite does not always lead to the affirmation of the other. For it follows that if a thing is white, it is not black: but it does not follow that if it is not black, it is white: because negation extends further than affirmation. And hence too, that one ought not to do harm to another, which pertains to the negative precepts, extends to more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as a primary dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, than that one ought to do someone a service or kindness. Nevertheless it is a primary dictate of reason that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a debtor in the point of rendering a service or kindness to those from whom he has received kindness, if he has not yet repaid the debt. Now there are two whose favors no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can sufficiently repay, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> father, as stated in Ethic. viii, 14. Therefore it is that there are only two affirmative precepts; one about the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to parents, the other about the celebration of the Sabbath in memory of the Divine favor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reasons for the purely moral precepts are manifest; hence there was no need to add the reason. But some of the precepts include ceremonial <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or a determination of a general moral precept; thus the first precept includes the determination, "Thou shalt not make a graven thing"; and in the third precept the Sabbath-day is fixed. Consequently there was need to state the reason in each case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Generally speaking, men direct their actions to some point of utility. Consequently in those precepts in which it seemed that there would be no useful result, or that some utility might be hindered, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to add a promise of reward. And since parents are already on the way to depart from us, no benefit is expected from them: wherefore a promise of reward is added to the precept about honoring one's parents. The same applies to the precept forbidding <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: since thereby it seemed that men were hindered from receiving the apparent benefit which they think they can get by entering into a compact with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Punishments are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> against those who are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated in Ethic. x, 9. Wherefore a threat of punishment is only affixed to those precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which forbade <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to which men were prone. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were prone to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> by reason of the general custom of the nations. Likewise men are prone to perjury on account of the frequent use of oaths. Hence it is that a threat is affixed to the first two precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The commandment about the Sabbath was made in memory of a past <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. Wherefore special mention of the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> is made therein. Or again, the commandment about the Sabbath has a determination affixed to it that does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, wherefore this precept needed a special admonition.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the precepts of the decalogue are dispensable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are dispensable. For the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> fails in some cases and is changeable, like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 7). Now the failure of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to apply in certain particular cases is a reason for dispensation, as stated above (96, 6; 97, 4). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> can be granted in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands in the same relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can dispense with the precepts of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> made by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore, since the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can dispense with them. Now our superiors are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> viceregents on earth; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes have I done it in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore superiors can dispense with the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is one forbidding <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. But it seems that a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this precept: for instance, when according to the prescription of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, such as evil-doers or enemies are lawfully slain. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are dispensable.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the observance of the Sabbath is ordained by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. But a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was granted in this precept; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1ma002.htm#verse4">1 Maccabees 2:4</a>): "And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up to fight against us on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a>, we will fight against him." Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are dispensable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> are the words of <a href="../bible/isa024.htm#verse5">Isaiah 24:5</a>, where some are reproved for that "they have changed the ordinance, they have broken the everlasting covenant"; which, seemingly, apply principally to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> cannot be changed by dispensation.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (96, 6; 97, 4), precepts admit of dispensation, when there occurs a particular case in which, if the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> be observed, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is frustrated. Now the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of every lawgiver is directed first and chiefly to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; secondly, to the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereby the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is preserved and attained. If therefore there by any precepts which contain the very preservation of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or the very order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such precepts contain the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, and therefore are indispensable. For instance, if in some community a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> were enacted, such as this--that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should work for the destruction of the commonwealth, or betray the state to its enemies, or that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should do anything <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, such precepts would not admit of dispensation. But if other precepts were enacted, subordinate to the above, and determining certain special modes of procedure, these latter precepts would admit of dispensation, in so far as the omission of these precepts in certain cases would not be prejudicial to the former precepts which contain the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver. For instance if, for the safeguarding of the commonwealth, it were enacted in some city that from each ward some men should keep watch as sentries in case of siege, some might be dispensed from this on account of some greater utility.

<p>Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contain the very <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the precepts of the first table, which direct us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, contain the very order to the common and final <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while the precepts of the second table contain the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be observed among men, that nothing undue be done to anyone, and that each one be given his due; for it is in this sense that we are to take the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Consequently the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> admit of no dispensation whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is not speaking of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> which contains the very order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for it is a never-failing principle that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should be preserved." But he is speaking in reference to certain fixed modes of observing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which fail to apply in certain cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 2:13</a>), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> continueth faithful, He cannot deny Himself." But He would deny Himself if He were to do away with the very order of His own <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since He is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot dispense a man so that it be lawful for him not to direct himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or not to be subject to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even in those matters in which men are directed to one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The slaying of a man is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, in so far as it bears the character of something undue: for in this sense the precept contains the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot make it lawful for a man to be slain unduly. But it is not undue for evil-doers or foes of the common weal to be slain: hence this is not contrary to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>; and such a killing is no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> as forbidden by that precept, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Lib. Arb. i, 4). In like manner when a man's property is taken from him, if it be due that he should lose it, this is not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery as forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p>Consequently when the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command, took away the spoils of the Egyptians, this was not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>; since it was due to them by the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Likewise when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> consented to slay his son, he did not consent to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, because his son was due to be slain by the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is Lord of life and death: for He it is Who inflicts the punishment of death on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, both godly and ungodly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, and if a man be the executor of that sentence by Divine authority, he will be no murderer any more than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be. Again Osee, by taking unto himself a wife of fornications, or an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was not guilty either of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or of fornication: because he took unto himself one who was his by command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Author of the institution of marriage.

<p>Accordingly, therefore, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which they contain, are unchangeable: but as to any determination by application to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> actions--for instance, that this or that be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or not--in this point they admit of change; sometimes by Divine authority alone, namely, in such matters as are exclusively of Divine institution, as marriage and the like; sometimes also by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority, namely in such matters as are subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>: for in this respect men stand in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and yet not in all respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This determination was an interpretation rather than a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. For a man is not taken to break the Sabbath, if he does something <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> welfare; as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> proves (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse3">Matthew 12:3, seqq.</a>).

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the mode of virtue falls under the precept of the law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should be done <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> should be done bravely, and in like manner as to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But it is commanded (<a href="../bible/deu026.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 26:20</a>) that "thou shalt follow <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> after that which is just." Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls under the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver comes chiefly under the precept. But the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is directed chiefly to make men <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii: and it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act virtuously. Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls under the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seems to consist properly in working willingly and with pleasure. But this falls under a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa099.htm#verse2">Psalm 99:2</a>): "Serve ye the Lord with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">gladness</a>"; and (<a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>): "Not with sadness or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth a cheerful giver"; whereupon the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Whatever ye do, do gladly; and then you will do it well; whereas if you do it sorrowfully, it is done in thee, not by thee." Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can act as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts unless he has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. ii, 4; v, 8). Now whoever transgresses a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, deserves to be punished. Hence it would follow that a man who has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, would deserve to be punished, whatever he does. But this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which aims at leading <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by habituating him to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not fall under the precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, 3, ad 2), a precept of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has compulsory power. Hence that on which the compulsion of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is brought to bear, falls directly under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> compels through fear of punishment, as stated in Ethic. x, 9, because that properly falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, for which the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is inflicted. But <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are differently situated as to the appointment of penalties; since the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is inflicted only for those things which come under the judgment of the lawgiver; for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> punishes in accordance with the verdict given. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the framer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is competent to judge only of outward acts; because "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeth those things that appear," according to <a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>: while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, the framer of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, is competent to judge of the inward movements of wills, according to <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse10">Psalm 7:10</a>: "The searcher of hearts and reins is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Accordingly, therefore, we must say that the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in some sort regarded both by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; in some respect it is regarded by the Divine, but not by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and in another way, it is regarded neither by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nor by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in three things, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states in Ethic. ii. The first is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should act "knowingly": and this is subject to the judgment of both Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; because what a man does in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, he does <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Hence according to both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, certain things are judged in respect of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to be punishable or pardonable.

<p>The second point is that a man should act "deliberately," i.e. "from choice, choosing that particular action for its own sake"; wherein a twofold internal movement is implied, of volition and of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, about which we have spoken above (Q8, 12): and concerning these two, <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> alone, and not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is competent to judge. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not punish the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who wishes to slay, and slays not: whereas the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> does, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>: "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment."

<p>The third point is that he should "act from a firm and immovable principle": which firmness belongs properly to a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and implies that the action proceeds from a rooted <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. In this respect, the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not fall under the precept either of Divine or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, since neither by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is he punished as breaking the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, who gives due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to his parents and yet has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of filial piety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The mode of doing acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which falls under the precept, is that they be done in accordance with right; but not that they be done from the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver is twofold. His aim, in the first place, is to lead men to something by the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is brought to bear on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> itself of the precept: and this is something leading or disposing to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, viz. an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the end of the precept and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the precept are not the same: just as neither in other things is the end the same as that which conduces to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be done without sadness, falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; for whoever works with sadness works unwillingly. But to work with pleasure, i.e. joyfully or cheerfully, in one respect falls under the precept, viz. in so far as pleasure ensues from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and one's neighbor (which love falls under the precept), and love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pleasure: and in another respect does not fall under the precept, in so far as pleasure ensues from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; for "pleasure taken in a work proves the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," as stated in Ethic. ii, 3. For an act may give pleasure either on account of its end, or through its proceeding from a becoming <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the mode of charity falls under the precept of the Divine law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17</a>): "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments": whence it seems to follow that the observance of the commandments suffices for entrance into life. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works do not suffice for entrance into life, except they be done from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>): "If I should distribute all my goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is included in the commandment.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> consists properly speaking in doing all things for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this falls under the precept; for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>): "Do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> falls under the precept.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not fall under the precept, it follows that one can fulfil the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now what can be done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be done without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is always united to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore one can fulfil the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But this is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Pelagius, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Haeres. lxxxviii). Therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is included in the commandment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whoever breaks a commandment <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. If therefore the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> falls under the precept, it follows that whoever acts otherwise than from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. But whoever has not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, acts otherwise than from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore it follows that whoever has not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally in whatever he does, however <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> this may be in itself: which is absurd.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Opinions have been contrary on this question. For some have said absolutely that the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> comes under the precept; and yet that it is possible for one not having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to fulfil this precept: because he can dispose himself to receive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor (say they) does it follow that a man not having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally whenever he does something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of its kind: because it is an affirmative precept that binds one to act from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and is binding not for all time, but only for such time as one is in a state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. On the other hand, some have said that the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is altogether outside the precept.

<p>Both these opinions are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> up to a certain point. Because the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be considered in two ways. First, as an act by itself: and thus it falls under the precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which specially prescribes it, viz. "Thou shalt love the thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," and "Thou shalt love thy neighbor." In this sense, the first opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Because it is not impossible to observe this precept which regards the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can dispose himself to possess <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and when he possesses it, he can use it. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be considered as being the mode of the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, i.e. inasmuch as the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are ordained to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is "the end of the commandment," as stated in <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>: for it has been said above (Question 12, Article 4) that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end is a formal mode of the act ordained to that end. In this sense the second opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in saying that the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not fall under the precept, that is to say that this commandment, "Honor thy father," does not mean that a man must <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> his father from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but merely that he must <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him. Wherefore he that honors his father, yet has not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, does not break this precept: although he does break the precept concerning the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, for which reason he deserves to be punished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not say, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep one commandment"; but "keep" all "the commandments": among which is included the commandment concerning the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> contains the injunction that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be loved from our whole heart, which means that all things would be referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot fulfil the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, unless he also refer all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore he that honors his father and mother, is bound to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> them from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not in virtue of the precept, "Honor thy father and mother," but in virtue of the precept, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart." And since these are two affirmative precepts, not binding for all times, they can be binding, each one at a different time: so that it may happen that a man fulfils the precept of honoring his father and mother, without at the same time breaking the precept concerning the omission of the mode of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man cannot fulfil all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, unless he fulfil the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is impossible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently it is not possible, as Pelagius maintained, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether it is right to distinguish other moral precepts of the law besides the decalogue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is wrong to distinguish other moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> besides the decalogue. Because, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> declared (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew 22:40</a>), "on these two commandments" of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> "dependeth the whole <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." But these two commandments are explained by the ten commandments of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Therefore there is no need for other moral precepts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the moral precepts are distinct from the judicial and ceremonial precepts, as stated above (99, A3,4). But the determinations of the general moral precepts belong to the judicial and ceremonial precepts: and the general moral precepts are contained in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, or are even presupposed to the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore it was unsuitable to lay down other moral precepts besides the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the moral precepts are about the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contains, besides the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, moral precepts pertaining to religion, liberality, mercy, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; so there should have been added some precepts pertaining to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for instance, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, sobriety, and so forth. And yet such is not the case. It is therefore unbecoming to distinguish other moral precepts in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> besides those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse8">Psalm 18:8</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord is unspotted, converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is preserved from the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by other moral precepts besides those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Therefore it was right for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to include other moral precepts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is evident from what has been stated (99, A3,4), the judicial and ceremonial precepts derive their force from their institution alone: since before they were instituted, it seemed of no consequence whether things were done in this or that way. But the moral precepts derive their efficacy from the very dictate of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, even if they were never included in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Now of these there are three grades: for some are most certain, and so evident as to need no promulgation; such as the commandments of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, and others like these, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), which are, as it were, the ends of the commandments; wherefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can have an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> judgment about them. Some precepts are more detailed, the reason of which even an uneducated <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can easily grasp; and yet they need to be promulgated, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, in a few instances, happens to be led astray concerning them: these are the precepts of the decalogue. Again, there are some precepts the reason of which is not so evident to everyone, but only the wise; these are moral precepts added to the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, and given to the people by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.

<p>But since the things that are evident are the principles whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those that are not evident, these other moral precepts added to the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are reducible to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as so many corollaries. Thus the first commandment of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> forbids the worship of strange gods: and to this are added other precepts forbidding things relating to worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>): "Neither let there be found among you anyone that shall expiate his son or daughter, making them to pass through the fire: . . . neither let there by any wizard nor charmer, nor anyone that consulteth pythonic spirits, or fortune-tellers, or that seeketh the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the dead." The second commandment forbids perjury. To this is added the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> (<a href="../bible/lev024.htm#verse15">Leviticus 24:15, seqq</a>) and the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>). To the third commandment are added all the ceremonial precepts. To the fourth commandment prescribing the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to parents, is added the precept about honoring the aged, according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse32">Leviticus 19:32</a>: "Rise up before the hoary head, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the aged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; and likewise all the precepts prescribing the reverence to be observed towards our betters, or kindliness towards our equals or inferiors. To the fifth commandment, which forbids <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, is added the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and of any kind of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> inflicted on our neighbor, according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse16">Leviticus 19:16</a>: "Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbor": likewise the prohibition against hating one's brother (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse17">Leviticus 19:17</a>): "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thy brother in thy heart." To the sixth commandment which forbids <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is added the prohibition about whoredom, according to <a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>: "There shall be no whore among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, nor whoremonger among the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>"; and the prohibition against unnatural <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse22">Leviticus 18:22-23</a>: "Thou shalt not lie with mankind . . . thou shalt not copulate with any beast." To the seventh commandment which prohibits <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, is added the precept forbidding usury, according to <a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>: "Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury"; and the prohibition against <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>: "Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag"; and universally all prohibitions relating to peculations and larceny. To the eighth commandment, forbidding <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> testimony, is added the prohibition against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> judgment, according to <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse2">Exodus 23:2</a>: "Neither shalt thou yield in judgment, to the opinion of the most part, to stray from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and the prohibition against lying (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse7">Exodus 23:7</a>): "Thou shalt fly lying," and the prohibition against detraction, according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse16">Leviticus 19:16</a>: "Thou shalt not be a detractor, nor a whisperer among the people." To the other two commandments no further precepts are added, because thereby are forbidden all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are ordained to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor as pertaining evidently to our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards them; but the other precepts are so ordained as pertaining thereto less evidently.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is in virtue of their institution that the ceremonial and judicial precepts "are determinations of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>," not by reason of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, as in the case of the superadded moral precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The precepts of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are ordained for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated above (Question 90, Article 2). And since those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which direct our conduct towards others pertain directly to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as also does the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, in so far as the generative act conduces to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; hence precepts bearing directly on these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are given, both in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> and in addition thereto. As to the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> there are the order to be given by the commanders in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which is undertaken for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: as is clear from <a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is commanded (to speak thus): "Be not afraid, do not give back." In like manner the prohibition of acts of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is left to paternal admonition, since it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the household; hence it is said (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of parents: "He slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling, and to debauchery and banquetings."

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the moral precepts of the Old Law justified man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> justified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse13">Romans 2:13</a>): "For not the hearers of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are justified before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the doers of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> shall be justified." But the doers of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are those who fulfil the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore the fulfilling of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse5">Leviticus 18:5</a>): "Keep My laws and My judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them." But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is through <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the fulfilling of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is more efficacious than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> justifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; since there is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consisting in fulfilling the precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> justified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>): "The letter killeth": which, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Spir. et Lit. xiv), refers even to the moral precepts. Therefore the moral precepts did not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as "healthy" is said properly and first of that which is possessed of health, and secondarily of that which is a sign or a safeguard of health; so justification means first and properly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; while secondarily and improperly, as it were, it may denote a sign of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or a disposition thereto. If <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be taken in the last two ways, it is evident that it was conferred by the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; in so far, to wit, as they disposed men to the justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which they also signified, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxii, 24), "even the life of that people foretold and foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p>But if we speak of justification properly so called, then we must notice that it can be considered as in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or as in the act: so that accordingly justification may be taken in two ways. First, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, by becoming possessed of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: secondly, according as he does works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that in this sense justification is nothing else than the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, like the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, may denote either the acquired or the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as is clear from what has been stated (63, 4). The acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by works; but the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The latter is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, of which we are speaking now, and in this respect of which a man is said to be just before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse2">Romans 4:2</a>: "If <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were justified by works, he hath whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by moral precepts, which are about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions: wherefore the moral precepts could not justify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>If, on the other hand, by justification we understand the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, thus all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> justified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but in various ways. Because the ceremonial precepts taken as a whole contained something just in itself, in so far as they aimed at offering worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas taken individually they contained that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, not in itself, but by being a determination of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Hence it is said of these precepts that they did not justify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> save through the devotion and obedience of those who complied with them. On the other hand the moral and judicial precepts, either in general or also in particular, contained that which is just in itself: but the moral precepts contained that which is just in itself according to that "general <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" which is "every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" according to Ethic. v, 1: whereas the judicial precepts belonged to "special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," which is about contracts connected with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mode of life, between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> takes justification for the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who fulfilled the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is said to live in them, because he did not incur the penalty of death, which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> inflicted on its transgressors: in this sense the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> quotes this passage (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse12">Galatians 3:12</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The precepts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> justify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by acquired <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: it is not about this that we are inquiring now, but only about that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
