<h1>Question 101. Piety</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3101.htm#article1"> To whom does piety extend?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3101.htm#article2"> What does piety make one offer a person?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3101.htm#article3"> Is piety a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3101.htm#article4"> Should the duties of piety be omitted for the sake of religion?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether piety extends to particular human individuals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that piety does not extend to particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> individuals. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x) that piety denotes, properly speaking, the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the Greeks designate by the term <em>eusebeia</em>. But the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not denote relation to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore piety does not extend definitely to certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>. i): "Piety, on her day, provides a banquet, because she fills the inmost recesses of the heart with <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> are to be done to all, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. i). Therefore piety does not extend definitely to certain special <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs there are many other mutual relations besides those of kindred and citizenship, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 11,12), and on each of them is founded a kind of friendship, which would seem to be the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of piety, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, "Having an appearance indeed of piety [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>']." Therefore piety extends not only to one's kindred and fellow-citizens.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by piety that we do our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards our kindred and well-wishers of our country and render them faithful service."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man becomes a debtor to other men in various ways, according to their various excellence and the various benefits received from them. on both counts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> holds first place, for He is supremely excellent, and is for us the first principle of being and government. On the second place, the principles of our being and government are our parents and our country, that have given us birth and nourishment. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is debtor chiefly to his parents and his country, after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore just as it belongs to religion to give worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so does it belong to piety, in the second place, to give worship to one's parents and one's country.

<p>The worship due to our parents includes the worship given to all our kindred, since our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsfolk</a> are those who descend from the same parents, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 12). The worship given to our country includes homage to all our fellow-citizens and to all the friends of our country. Therefore piety extends chiefly to these.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The greater includes the lesser: wherefore the worship due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> includes the worship due to our parents as a particular. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If I be a father, where is My <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>?" Consequently the term piety extends also to the divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x), "the term piety is often used in connection with <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, in the language of the common people; the reason for which I consider to be the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself has declared that these works are more pleasing to Him than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. This custom has led to the application of the word 'pious' to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The relations of a man with his kindred and fellow-citizens are more referable to the principles of his being than other relations: wherefore the term piety is more applicable to them.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether piety provides support for our parents?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that piety does not provide support for our parents. For, seemingly, the precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, "Honor thy father and mother," belongs to piety. But this prescribes only the giving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Therefore it does not belong to piety to provide support for one's parents.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man is bound to lay up for those whom he is bound to support. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>), "neither ought the children to lay up for the parents." Therefore piety does not oblige them to support their parents.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, piety extends not only to one's parents, but also to other kinsmen and to one's fellow-citizens, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But one is not bound to support all one's kindred and fellow-citizens. Therefore neither is one bound to support one's parents.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:3-6</a>) reproved the Pharisees for hindering children from supporting their parents.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We owe something to our parents in two ways: that is to say, both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. We owe them <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> that which is due to a father as such: and since he is his son's superior through being the principle of his being, the latter owes him reverence and service. Accidentally, that is due to a father, which it befits him to receive in respect of something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to him, for instance, if he be ill, it is fitting that his children should visit him and see to his cure; if he be poor, it is fitting that they should support him; and so on in like instance, all of which come under the head of service due. Hence Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "piety gives both <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and homage": "<a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>" referring to service, and "homage" to reverence or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x), "we are said to give homage to those whose <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> or presence we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> interpretation (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse3">Matthew 15:3-6</a>) the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to our parents includes whatever support we owe them; and the reason for this is that support is given to one's father because it is due to him as to one greater.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since a father stands in the relation of principle, and his son in the relation of that which is from a principle, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> fitting for a father to support his son: and consequently he is bound to support him not only for a time, but for all his life, and this is to lay by. On the other hand, for the son to bestow something on his father is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, arising from some momentary <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, wherein he is bound to support him, but not to lay by as for a long time beforehand, because <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> parents are not the successors of their children, but children of their parents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), "we offer homage and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to all our kindred and to the well-wishers of our country"; not, however, equally to all, but chiefly to our parents, and to others according to our means and their personal claims.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether piety is a special virtue distinct from other virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that piety is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For the giving of service and homage to anyone proceeds from love. But it belongs to piety. Therefore piety is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is proper to religion to give worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But piety also gives worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x). Therefore piety is not distinct from religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, piety, whereby we give our country worship and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, seems to be the same as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which looks to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1,2). Therefore piety is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is accounted by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) as a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one that regards an object under a special aspect. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in rendering another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> his due, wherever there is a special aspect of something due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, there is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a thing is indebted in a special way to that which is its connatural principle of being and government. And piety regards this principle, inasmuch as it pays <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and homage to our parents and country, and to those who are related thereto. Therefore piety is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as religion is a protestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is primarily directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so again piety is a protestation of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we bear towards our parents and country.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle of our being and government in a far more excellent manner than one's father or country. Hence religion, which gives worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from piety, which pays homage to our parents and country. But things relating to creatures are transferred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the summit of excellence and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i): wherefore, by way of excellence, piety designates the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by way of excellence, is called "Our Father."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Piety extends to our country in so far as the latter is for us a principle of being: but legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of our country, considered as the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: wherefore legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has more of the character of a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than piety has.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the duties of piety towards one's parents should be omitted for the sake of religion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the duties of piety towards one's parents should be omitted for the sake of religion. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke 14:26</a>): "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to Me, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple." Hence it is said in praise of James and John (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse22">Matthew 4:22</a>) that they left "their nets and father, and followed" Christ. Again it is said in praise of the Levites (<a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 33:9</a>): "Who hath said to his father, and to his mother: I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you; and to his brethren: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not; and their own children they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. These have kept Thy word." Now a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not his parents and other kinsmen, or who even <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> them, must needs omit the duties of piety. Therefore the duties of piety should be omitted for the sake of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse59">Luke 9:59-60</a>) that in answer to him who said: "Suffer me first to go and bury my father," <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> replied: "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou, and preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Now the latter pertains to religion, while it is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of piety to bury one's father. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of piety should be omitted for the sake of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called "Our Father" by excellence. Now just as we worship our parents by paying them the duties of piety so do we worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by religion. Therefore the duties of piety should be omitted for the sake of the worship of religion.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, religious are bound by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which they may not break to fulfil the observances of religion. Now in accordance with those observances they are hindered from supporting their parents, both on the score of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, since they have nothing of their own, and on the score of obedience, since they may not leave the cloister without the permission of their superior. Therefore the duties of piety towards one's parents should be omitted for the sake of religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> reproved the Pharisees (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse3">Matthew 15:3-6</a>) who taught that for the sake of religion one ought to refrain from paying one's parents the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> we owe them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Religion and piety are two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, in his book on the Categories (Cap. De oppos.), "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore it is impossible that religion and piety mutually hinder one another, so that the act of one be excluded by the act of the other. Now, as stated above (I-II, 07, 2; I-II, 18, 3), the act of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is limited by the circumstances due thereto, and if it overstep them it will be an act no longer of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Hence it belongs to piety to pay <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and homage to one's parents according to the due mode. But it is not the due mode that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should tend to worship his father rather than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse52">Luke 12:52</a>, "the piety of divine religion takes precedence of the claims of kindred."

<p>Accordingly, if the worship of one's parents take one away from the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it would no longer be an act of piety to pay worship to one's parents to the prejudice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Heliod.): "Though thou trample upon thy father, though thou spurn thy mother, turn not aside, but with dry eyes hasten to the standard of the cross; it is the highest degree of piety to be cruel in this matter." Therefore in such a case the duties of piety towards one's parents should be omitted for the sake of the worship religion gives to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, however, by paying the services due to our parents, we are not withdrawn from the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then will it be an act of piety, and there will be no need to set piety aside for the sake of religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounding this saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (Hom. xxxvii in Ev.) that "when we find our parents to be a hindrance in our way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must ignore them by hating and fleeing from them." For if our parents incite us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and withdraw us from the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must, as regards this point, abandon and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them. It is in this sense that the Levites are said to have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their kindred, because they obeyed the Lord's command, and spared not the idolaters (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus 32</a>). James and John are praised for leaving their parents and following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, not that their father incited them to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but because they deemed it possible for him to find another means of livelihood, if they followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbade the disciple to bury his father because, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxviii in Matth.), "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> by so doing saved him from many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, such as the sorrows and worries and other things that one anticipates under these circumstances. For after the burial the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> had to be read, the estate had to be divided, and so forth: but chiefly, because there were others who could see to the funeral." Or, according to Cyril's commentary on <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9</a>, "this disciple's request was, not that he might bury a dead father, but that he might support a yet living father in the latter's old age, until at length he should bury him. This is what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not grant, because there were others, bound by the duties of kindred, to take care of him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatever we give our parents out of piety is referred by us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as other <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> which we perform with regard to any of our neighbors are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew 25:40</a>: "As long as you did it to one of . . . My least . . . you did it to Me." Accordingly, if our carnal parents stand in need of our assistance, so that they have no other means of support, provided they incite us to nothing against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must not abandon them for the sake of religion. But if we cannot devote ourselves to their service without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or if they can be supported without our assistance, it is lawful to forego their service, so as to give more time to religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We must speak differently of one who is yet in the world, and of one who has made his profession in religion. For he that is in the world, if he has parents unable to find support without him, he must not leave them and enter religion, because he would be breaking the commandment prescribing the honoring of parents. Some say, however, that even then he might abandon them, and leave them in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> care. But this, considered aright, would be to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since, while having <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> means at hand, he would be exposing his parents to danger, in the hope of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance. on the other hand, if the parents can find means of livelihood without him, it is lawful for him to abandon them and enter religion, because children are not bound to support their parents except in cases of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as stated above. He that has already made his profession in religion is deemed to be already dead to the world: wherefore he ought not, under pretext of supporting his parents, to leave the cloister where he is buried with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and busy himself once more with worldly affairs. Nevertheless he is bound, saving his obedience to his superiors, and his religious state withal, to make points efforts for his parents' support.
