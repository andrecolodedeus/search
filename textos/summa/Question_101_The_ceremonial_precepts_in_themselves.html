<h1>Question 101. The ceremonial precepts in themselves</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2101.htm#article1"> The nature of the ceremonial precepts</a> <li><a href="../summa/2101.htm#article2"> Are they figurative?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2101.htm#article3"> Should there have been many of them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2101.htm#article4"> Their various kinds</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the nature of the ceremonial precepts consists in their pertaining to the worship of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the ceremonial precepts does not consist in their pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were given certain precepts about abstinence from food (<a href="../bible/lev011.htm">Leviticus 11</a>); and about refraining from certain kinds of clothes, e.g. (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse19">Leviticus 19:19</a>): "Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of two sorts"; and again (<a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse38">Numbers 15:38</a>): "To make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments." But these are not moral precepts; since they do not remain in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Nor are they judicial precepts; since they do not pertain to the pronouncing of judgment between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore they are ceremonial precepts. Yet they seem in no way to pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the ceremonial precepts does not consist in their pertaining to Divine worship.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some state that the ceremonial precepts are those which pertain to solemnities; as though they were so called from the "cerei" [candles] which are lit up on those occasions. But many other things besides solemnities pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it does not seem that the ceremonial precepts are so called from their pertaining to the Divine worship.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some say that the ceremonial precepts are patterns, i.e. rules, of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: because the Greek <em>chaire</em> is the same as the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "salve." But all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are rules of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and not only those that pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore not only those precepts which pertain to Divine worship are called ceremonial.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> says (Doct. Perplex. iii) that the ceremonial precepts are those for which there is no evident reason. But there is evident reason for many things pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; such as the observance of the Sabbath, the feasts of the Passover and of the Tabernacles, and many other things, the reason for which is set down in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore the ceremonial precepts are not those which pertain to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse19">Exodus 18:19-20</a>): "Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . and . . . shew the people the ceremonies and the manner of worshipping."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 99, Article 4), the ceremonial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as the judicial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts whereby he is directed to his neighbor. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the worship due to Him. Wherefore those precepts are properly called ceremonial, which pertain to the Divine worship. The reason for their being so called was given above (Question 99, Article 3), when we established the distinction between the ceremonial and the other precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine worship includes not only <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the like, which seem to be directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, but also those things whereby His worshippers are duly prepared to worship Him: thus too in other matters, whatever is preparatory to the end comes under the science whose object is the end. Accordingly those precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> which regard the clothing and food of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> worshippers, and other such matters, pertain to a certain preparation of the ministers, with the view of fitting them for the Divine worship: just as those who administer to a king make use of certain special observances. Consequently such are contained under the ceremonial precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The alleged explanation of the name does not seem very probable: especially as the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> does not contain many instances of the lighting of candles in solemnities; since, even the lamps of the Candlestick were furnished with "oil of olives," as stated in <a href="../bible/lev024.htm#verse2">Leviticus 24:2</a>. Nevertheless we may say that all things pertaining to the Divine worship were more carefully observed on <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> festivals: so that all ceremonial precepts may be included under the observance of solemnities.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Neither does this explanation of the name appear to be very much to the point, since the word "ceremony" is not Greek but <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>. We may say, however, that, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those precepts above all seem to be rules of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and accordingly those which refer to Divine worship are called ceremonial precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This explanation of the ceremonial precepts has a certain amount of probability: not that they are called ceremonial precisely because there is no evident reason for them; this is a kind of

<p>consequence. For, since the precepts referring to the Divine worship must needs be figurative, as we shall state further on (2), the consequence is that the reason for them is not so very evident.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the ceremonial precepts are figurative?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonial precepts are not figurative. For it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of every teacher to express himself in such a way as to be easily understood, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Doctr. Christ. iv, 4,10) and this seems very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the framing of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: because precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are proposed to the populace; for which reason a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be manifest, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> declares (Etym. v, 21). If therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> were given as figures of something, it seems unbecoming that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should have delivered these precepts without explaining what they signified.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is done for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be entirely free from unfittingness. But the performance of actions in representation of others, seems to savor of the theatre or of the drama: because formerly the actions performed in theatres were done to represent the actions of others. Therefore it seems that such things should not be done for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the ceremonial precepts are ordained to the Divine worship, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore they should not be figurative.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion iii, iv) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshipped chiefly by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But the precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not figurative. Therefore the ceremonial precepts should not be figurative.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him, must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But a figure is not the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: in fact one is condivided with the other. Therefore the ceremonial precepts, which refer to the Divine worship, should not be figurative.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians 2:16-17</a>): "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1; 99, A3,4), the ceremonial precepts are those which refer to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the Divine worship is twofold: internal, and external. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, each of these should be applied to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by an interior worship; the body by an outward worship: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse3">Psalm 83:3</a>): "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And as the body is ordained to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so the outward worship is ordained to the internal worship. Now interior worship consists in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and affections. Wherefore according to the various ways in which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and affections of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are rightly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his external actions are applied in various ways to the Divine worship.

<p>For in the state of future bliss, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will gaze on the Divine Truth in Itself. Wherefore the external worship will not consist in anything figurative, but solely in the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, proceeding from the inward <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and affection, according to <a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse3">Isaiah 51:3</a>: "Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of praise."

<p>But in the present state of life, we are unable to gaze on the Divine Truth in Itself, and we need the ray of Divine light to shine upon us under the form of certain sensible figures, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Coel. Hier. i); in various ways, however, according to the various states of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, neither was the Divine Truth manifest in Itself, nor was the way leading to that manifestation as yet opened out, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse8">Hebrews 9:8</a>). Hence the external worship of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> needed to be figurative not only of the future <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be manifested in our heavenly country, but also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the way leading to that heavenly manifestation. But under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> this way is already revealed: and therefore it needs no longer to be foreshadowed as something future, but to be brought to our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> as something past or present: and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come, which is not yet revealed, alone needs to be foreshadowed. This is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>): "The Law has [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'having'] a shadow of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, not the very image of the things": for a shadow is less than an image; so that the image belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, but the shadow to the Old.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not to be revealed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except in proportion to his capacity: else he would be in danger of downfall, were he to despise what he cannot grasp. Hence it was more beneficial that the Divine mysteries should be revealed to uncultured people under a veil of figures, that thus they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them at least implicitly by using those figures to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> fails to grasp poetical expressions on account of their being lacking in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so does it fail to grasp Divine things perfectly, on account of the sublimity of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they contain: and therefore in both cases there is need of signs by means of sensible figures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there of internal worship; to which, however, external worship should be ordained, as stated above.

<p>The same answer applies to the Fourth Objection: because men were taught by Him to practice more perfectly the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there should have been man ceremonial precepts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there should not have been many ceremonial precepts. For those things which conduce to an end should be proportionate to that end. But the ceremonial precepts, as stated above (1,2), are ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the foreshadowing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now "there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of Whom are all things . . . and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by Whom are all things" (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>). Therefore there should not have been many ceremonial precepts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the great number of the ceremonial precepts was an occasion of transgression, according to the words of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts 15:10</a>): "Why <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to put a yoke upon the necks of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?" Now the transgression of the Divine precepts is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Since, therefore, every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should conduce to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 3), it seems that the ceremonial precepts should not have been given in great number.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the ceremonial precepts referred to the outward and bodily worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should have lessened this bodily worship: since it directed men to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who taught them to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," as stated in <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John 4:23</a>. Therefore there should not have been many ceremonial precepts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> (<a href="../bible/hos008.htm#verse12">Hosea 8:12</a>): "I shall write to them [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'him'] My manifold laws"; and (<a href="../bible/job011.htm#verse6">Job 11:6</a>): "That He might show thee the secrets of His wisdom, and that His Law is manifold."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 96, Article 1), every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is given to a people. Now a people contains two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: some, prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who have to be coerced by the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as stated above (Question 95, Article 1); some, inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, either from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or from custom, or rather from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and the like have to be taught and improved by means of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Accordingly, with regard to both kinds of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Accordingly, with regard to both kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it was expedient that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should contain many ceremonial precepts. For in that people there were many prone to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; wherefore it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to recall them by means of ceremonial precepts from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since men served <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in many ways, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on the other hand to devise many means of repressing every single one: and again, to lay many <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> on such like men, in order that being burdened, as it were, by their duties to the Divine worship, they might have no time for the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. As to those who were inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it was again <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there should be many ceremonial precepts; both because thus their mind turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in many ways, and more continually; and because the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was foreshadowed by these ceremonial precepts, brought many boons to the world, and afforded men many considerations, which needed to be signified by various ceremonies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When that which conduces to an end is sufficient to conduce thereto, then one such thing suffices for one end: thus one remedy, if it be efficacious, suffices sometimes to restore men to health, and then the remedy needs not to be repeated. But when that which conduces to an end is weak and imperfect, it needs to be multiplied: thus many remedies are given to a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when one is not enough to heal him. Now the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were weak and imperfect, both for representing the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of its surpassing excellence; and for subjugating men's minds to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse18">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>): "There is a setting aside of the former commandment because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof, for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> brought nothing to perfection." Consequently these ceremonies needed to be in great number.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A wise lawgiver should suffer lesser transgressions, that the greater may be avoided. And therefore, in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which would arise in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, were they to fulfil all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the fact that they would in consequence find many occasions of disobedience did not prevent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from giving them many ceremonial precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> lessened bodily worship in many ways. Thus it forbade <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be offered in every place and by any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Many such like things did it enact for the lessening of bodily worship; as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>, the Egyptian testifies (Doct. Perplex. iii). Nevertheless it behooved not to attenuate the bodily worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so much as to allow men to fall away into the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the ceremonies of the Old Law are suitably divided into sacrifices, sacred things, sacraments, and observances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> are unsuitably divided into "<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, sacred things, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and observances." For the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But this was done only by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which foreshadowed the sacrifice in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "delivered Himself an oblation and a sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>). Therefore none but the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were ceremonies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was ordained to the New. But in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the sacrifice is the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there should be no distinction between "<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a "sacred thing" is something dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: in which sense the tabernacle and its vessels were said to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. But all the ceremonial precepts were ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore all ceremonies were sacred things. Therefore "sacred things" should not be taken as a part of the ceremonies.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, "observances" are so called from having to be observed. But all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had to be observed: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>): "Observe [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'Take heed'] and beware lest at any time thou forget the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and neglect His commandments and judgments and ceremonies." Therefore the "observances" should not be considered as a part of the ceremonies.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> festivals are reckoned as part of the ceremonial: since they were a shadow of things to come (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians 2:16-17</a>): and the same may be said of the oblations and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as appears from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse9">Hebrews 9:9</a>): and yet these do not seem to be inclined in any of those mentioned above. Therefore the above division of ceremonies is unsuitable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> each of the above is called a ceremony. For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are called ceremonies (<a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse24">Numbers 15:24</a>): "They shall offer a calf . . . and the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require." Of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Order</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/lev007.htm#verse35">Leviticus 7:35</a>): "This is the anointing of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons in the ceremonies." Of sacred things also it is written (<a href="../bible/exo038.htm#verse21">Exodus 38:21</a>): "These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony . . . in the ceremonies of the Levites." And again of the observances it is written (<a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#verse6">1 Kings 9:6</a>): "If you . . . shall turn away from following Me, and will not observe [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'keep'] My . . . ceremonies which I have set before you."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,2), the ceremonial precepts are ordained to the Divine worship. Now in this worship we may consider the worship itself, the worshippers, and the instruments of worship. The worship consists specially in "<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>," which are offered up in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The instruments of worship refer to the "sacred things," such as the tabernacle, the vessels and so forth. With regard to the worshippers two points may be considered. The first point is their preparation for Divine worship, which is effected by a sort of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> either of the people or of the ministers; and to this the "<a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>" refer. The second point is their particular mode of life, whereby they are distinguished from those who do not worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and to this pertain the "observances," for instance, in matters of food, clothing, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be offered both in some certain place and by some certain men: and all this pertained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore just as their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> signified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the victim, so too their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and sacred things of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; while their observances foreshadowed the mode of life of the people under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: all of which things pertain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the New Law</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, contains <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, the Author of our Sanctification: for He sanctified "the people by His own blood" (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>). Hence this Sacrifice is also a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not contain <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but foreshadowed Him; hence they are not called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In order to signify this there were certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were figures of the sanctification to come. Nevertheless to certain consecrations certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were united.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were of course sacred things. But certain things were sacred, through being dedicated to the Divine worship, and yet were not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: wherefore they retained the common designation of sacred things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those things which pertained to the mode of life of the people who worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, retained the common designation of observances, in so far as they fell short of the above. For they were not called sacred things, because they had no immediate connection with the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such as the tabernacle and its vessels had. But by a sort of consequence they were matters of ceremony, in so far as they affected the fitness of the people who worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered in a fixed place, so were they offered at fixed times: for which reason the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> festivals seem to be reckoned among the sacred things. The oblations and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are counted together with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> taken from among men, is ordained for men in things that appertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may offer up <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>."
