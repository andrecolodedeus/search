<h1>Question 101. The condition of the offspring as regards knowledge</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1101.htm#article1"> Would children in the state of innocence have been born with perfect knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1101.htm#article2"> Would they have had perfect use of reason at the moment of birth?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born with perfect knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have been born with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> would have begotten children like himself. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was gifted with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (94, 3). Therefore children would have been born of him with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is a result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Cf. I-II, 85, 3). But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> children would have had perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as soon as they were born.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, children would have been gifted with righteousness from birth. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is required for righteousness, since it directs our actions. Therefore they would also have been gifted with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> "like a blank tablet on which nothing is written," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4). But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the same now as it would have been in the state of innocence. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of children would have been without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at birth.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (99, 1), as regards <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in matters which are above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we rely on authority alone; and so, when authority is wanting, we must be guided by the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the senses, as above explained (55, 2; 84, 6); and for this reason is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> united to the body, that it needs it for its proper operation; and this would not be so if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were endowed at birth with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not acquired through the sensitive powers. We must conclude then, that, in the state of innocence, children would not have been born with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but in course of time they would have acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without difficulty by discovery or learning.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, so far as he was established as the father and instructor of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Therefore he begot children like himself, not in that respect, but only in those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which were <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or conferred gratuitously on the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> is privation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> due at some particular time; and this would not have been in children from their birth, for they would have possessed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> due to them at that time. Hence, no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> would have been in them, but only nescience in regard to certain matters. Such nescience was even in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Children would have had sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to direct them to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of righteousness, in which men are guided by universal principles of right; and this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of theirs would have been much more complete than what we have now by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as likewise their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other universal principles.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether children would have had perfect use of reason at birth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that children would have had perfect use of reason at birth. For that children have not perfect use of reason in our present state, is due to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being weighed down by the body; which was not the case in paradise, because, as it is written, "The corruptible body is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom 9:15</a>). Therefore, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the corruption which resulted therefrom, children would have had the perfect use of reason at birth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some animals at birth have the use of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, as the lamb at once flees from the wolf. Much more, therefore, would men in the state of innocence have had perfect use of reason at birth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In all things produced by generation <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proceeds from the imperfect to the perfect. Therefore children would not have had the perfect use of reason from the very outset.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (84, 7), the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> depends in a certain manner on the use of the sensitive powers; wherefore, while the senses are tired and the interior sensitive powers hampered, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not the perfect use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as we see in those who are asleep or delirious. Now the sensitive powers are situate in corporeal organs; and therefore, so long as the latter are hindered, the action of the former is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> hindered also; and likewise, consequently, the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now children are hindered in the use of these powers on account of the humidity of the brain; wherefore they have perfect use neither of these powers nor of reason. Therefore, in the state of innocence, children would not have had the perfect use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which they would have enjoyed later on in life. Yet they would have had a more perfect use than they have now, as to matters regarding that particular state, as explained above regarding the use of their limbs (99, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The corruptible body is a load upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because it hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> even in those matters which belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at all ages.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even other animals have not at birth such a perfect use of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers as they have later on. This is clear from the fact that birds teach their young to fly; and the like may be observed in other animals. Moreover a special impediment <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the humidity of the brain, as we have said above (Question 99, Article 1).
