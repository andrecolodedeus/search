<h1>Question 102. Man's abode, which is paradise</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1102.htm#article1"> Is paradise a corporeal place?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1102.htm#article2"> Is it a place apt for human habitation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1102.htm#article3"> for what purpose was man placed in paradise?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1102.htm#article4"> Should he have been created in paradise?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether paradise is a corporeal place?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that paradise is not a corporeal place. For <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> [Strabus, Gloss on <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis 2:8</a>] says that "paradise reaches to the lunar circle." But no earthly place answers that description, both because it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the earth to be raised up so high, and because beneath the moon is the region of fire, which would consume the earth. Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> mentions four rivers as rising in paradise (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse10">Genesis 2:10</a>). But the rivers there mentioned have visible sources elsewhere, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Meteor. i). Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, although men have explored the entire habitable world, yet none have made mention of the place of paradise. Therefore apparently it is not a corporeal place.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the tree of life is described as growing in paradise. But the tree of life is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, for it is written of Wisdom that "She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her" (<a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse18">Proverbs 3:18</a>). Therefore paradise also is not a corporeal, but a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> place.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if paradise be a corporeal place, the trees also of paradise must be corporeal. But it seems they were not; for corporeal trees were produced on the third day, while the planting of the trees of paradise is recorded after the work of the six days. Therefore paradise was not a corporeal place.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 1): "Three general opinions prevail about paradise. Some understand a place merely corporeal; others a place entirely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>; while others, whose opinion, I confess, hold that paradise was both corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 21): "Nothing prevents us from holding, within proper limits, a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> paradise; so long as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the events narrated as having there occurred." For whatever <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> tells us about paradise is set down as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of history; and wherever <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> makes use of this method, we must hold to the historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the narrative as a foundation of whatever <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> explanation we may offer. And so paradise, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. xiv, 3), "is a place situated in the east, its name being the Greek for garden." It was fitting that it should be in the east; for it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it was situated in the most excellent part of the earth. Now the east is the right hand on the heavens, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (De Coel. ii, 2); and the right hand is nobler than the left: hence it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should place the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> in the east.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> assertion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, if taken in its obvious sense. It may, however, be explained to mean that paradise reaches to the moon, not literally, but figuratively; because, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. xiv, 3), the atmosphere there is "a continually even temperature"; and in this respect it is like the heavenly bodies, which are devoid of opposing elements. Mention, however, is made of the moon rather than of other bodies, because, of all the heavenly bodies, the moon is nearest to us, and is, moreover, the most akin to the earth; hence it is observed to be overshadowed by clouds so as to be almost obscured. Others say that paradise reached to the moon--that is, to the middle space of the air, where rain, and wind, and the like arise; because the moon is said to have influence on such changes. But in this sense it would not be a fit place for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> dwelling, through being uneven in temperature, and not attuned to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temperament, as is the lower atmosphere in the neighborhood of the earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 7): "It is probable that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> where paradise was, and that the rivers, whose sources are said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, flowed for some distance underground, and then sprang up elsewhere. For who is not aware that such is the case with some other streams?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The situation of paradise is shut off from the habitable world by mountains, or seas, or some torrid region, which cannot be crossed; and so people who have written about topography make no mention of it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The tree of life is a material tree, and so called because its fruit was endowed with a life-preserving power as above stated (97, 4). Yet it had a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> signification; as the rock in the desert was of a material <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and yet signified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In like manner the tree of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was a material tree, so called in view of future events; because, after eating of it, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was to learn, by experience of the consequent punishment, the difference between the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of obedience and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of rebellion. It may also be said to signify spiritually the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> as some say.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. v, 5, viii, 3), the plants were not actually produced on the third day, but in their seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; whereas, after the work of the six days, the plants, both of paradise and others, were actually produced. According to other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers, we ought to say that all the plants were actually produced on the third day, including the trees of paradise; and what is said of the trees of paradise being planted after the work of the six days is to be understood, they say, by way of recapitulation. Whence our text reads: "The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis 2:8</a>).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether paradise was a place adapted to be the abode of man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that paradise was not a place adapted to be the abode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are similarly ordered to beatitude. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from the very beginning of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> were made to dwell in the abode of the blessed--that is, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore the place of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> habitation should have been there also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if some definite place were required for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> abode, this would be required on the part either of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or of the body. If on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the place would be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is adapted to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; since the desire of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is implanted in all. On the part of the body, there was no need for any other place than the one provided for other animals. Therefore paradise was not at all adapted to be the abode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a place which contains nothing is useless. But after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, paradise was not occupied by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore if it were adapted as a dwelling-place for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made paradise to no purpose.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of an even temperament, a fitting place for him should be of even temperature. But paradise was not of an even temperature; for it is said to have been on the equator--a situation of extreme heat, since twice in the year the sun passes vertically over the heads of its inhabitants. Therefore paradise was not a fit dwelling-place for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): "Paradise was a divinely ordered region, and worthy of him who was made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (97, 1), Man was incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, not because his body had a disposition to incorruptibility, but because in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there was a power preserving the body from corruption. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body may be corrupted from within or from without. From within, the body is corrupted by the consumption of the humors, and by old age, as above explained (97, 4), and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able to ward off such corruption by food. Among those things which corrupt the body from without, the chief seems to be an atmosphere of unequal temperature; and to such corruption a remedy is found in an atmosphere of equable <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In paradise both <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> were found; because, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): "Paradise was permeated with the all pervading brightness of a temperate, pure, and exquisite atmosphere, and decked with ever-flowering plants." Whence it is clear that paradise was most fit to be a dwelling-place for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in keeping with his original state of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the highest of corporeal places, and is outside the region of change. By the first of these two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, it is a fitting abode for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rules corporeal creatures through <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures." Hence it is fitting that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be established above the entire corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as presiding over it. By the second <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, it is a fitting abode for the state of beatitude, which is endowed with the highest degree of stability. Thus the abode of beatitude was suited to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; therefore he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> there. But it is not suited to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not set as a ruler over the entire corporeal creation: it is a fitting abode for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in regard only to his beatitude. Wherefore he was not placed from the beginning in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but was destined to be transferred thither in the state of his final beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is ridiculous to assert that any particular place is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or to any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, though some particular place may have a certain fitness in regard to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> was a place adapted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as regards both his body and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--that is, inasmuch as in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was the force which preserved the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body from corruption. This could not be said of the other animals. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): "No irrational animal inhabited paradise"; although, by a certain dispensation, the animals were brought thither by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>; and the serpent was able to trespass therein by the complicity of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Paradise did not become useless through being unoccupied by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> was not conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in vain, though he was to lose it. For thereby we learn <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> kindness to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lost by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, some say that Enoch and Elias still dwell in that paradise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those who say that paradise was on the equinoctial line are of opinion that such a situation is most temperate, on account of the unvarying equality of day and night; that it is never too cold there, because the sun is never too far off; and never too hot, because, although the sun passes over the heads of the inhabitants, it does not remain long in that position. However, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> distinctly says (Meteor. ii, 5) that such a region is uninhabitable on account of the heat. This seems to be more probable; because, even those regions where the sun does not pass vertically overhead, are extremely hot on account of the mere proximity of the sun. But whatever be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, we must hold that paradise was situated in a most temperate situation, whether on the equator or elsewhere.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man was placed in paradise to dress it and keep it?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not placed in paradise to dress and keep it. For what was brought on him as a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in paradise in the state of innocence. But the cultivation of the soil was a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis 3:17</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not placed in paradise to dress and keep it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no need of a keeper when there is no fear of trespass with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. But in paradise there was no fear of trespass with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Therefore there was no need for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to keep paradise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was placed in paradise to dress and keep it, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would apparently have been made for the sake of paradise, and not contrariwise; which seems to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not place in paradise to dress and keep it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse15">Genesis 2:15</a>): "The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and placed in the paradise of pleasure, to dress and keep it."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 10), these words in Genesis may be understood in two ways.

<p>First, in the sense that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> placed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in paradise that He might Himself work in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and keep him, by sanctifying him (for if this work cease, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at once relapses into darkness, as the air grows dark when the light ceases to shine); and by keeping <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from all corruption and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>Secondly, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might dress and keep paradise, which dressing would not have involved labor, as it did after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but would have been pleasant on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the powers of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nor would <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have kept paradise against a trespasser; but he would have striven to keep paradise for himself lest he should lose it by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. All of which was for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore paradise was ordered to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> benefit, and not conversely.

<p>Whence the Replies to the Objections are made clear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether man was created in paradise?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in paradise. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in his dwelling-place--namely, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> paradise was a fitting abode for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in paradise.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, other animals remain in the place where they are produced, as the fish in the water, and walking animals on the earth from which they were made. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have remained in paradise after he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> (97, 4). Therefore he was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in paradise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made in paradise. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is greater than <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Therefore much more should <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have been made in paradise.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse15">Genesis 2:15</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and placed him in paradise."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Paradise was a fitting abode for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as regards the incorruptibility of the primitive state. Now this incorruptibility was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore that this might be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> outside of paradise, and afterwards placed him there to live there during the whole of his animal life; and, having attained to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, to be transferred thence to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was a fitting abode for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and therefore they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> there.

<p>In the same way I reply to the second objection, for those places befit those animals in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a> was made in paradise, not by reason of her own dignity, but on account of the dignity of the principle from which her body was formed. For the same reason the children would have been born in paradise, where their parents were already.
