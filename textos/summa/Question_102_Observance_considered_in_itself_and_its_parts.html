<h1>Question 102. Observance, considered in itself, and its parts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3102.htm#article1"> Is observance a special virtue, distinct from other virtues?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3102.htm#article2"> What does observance offer?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3102.htm#article3"> Its comparison with piety</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether observance is a special virtue, distinct from other virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that observance is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, distinct from other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinguished by their objects. But the object of observance is not distinct from the object of piety: for Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by observance that we pay worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to those who excel in some kind of dignity." But worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are paid also by piety to our parents, who excel in dignity. Therefore observance is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from piety.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and worship are due to those that are in a position of dignity, so also are they due to those who excel in science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But there is no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby we pay <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and worship to those who excel in science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore observance, whereby we pay worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to those who excel in dignity, is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we have many duties towards those who are in a position of dignity, the fulfilment of which is required by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse7">Romans 13:7</a>, "Render . . . to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due," etc. Now the fulfilment of the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> belongs to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or even to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore observance is not by itself a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons observance along with the other parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which are special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As explained above (101, 1 and 3; 80), according to the various excellences of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom something is due, there must needs be a corresponding distinction of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in a descending order. Now just as a carnal father partakes of the character of principle in a particular way, which character is found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a universal way, so too a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, in some way, exercises <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> in one respect, partakes of the character of father in a particular way, since a father is the principle of generation, of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, of learning and of whatever pertains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life: while a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is in a position of dignity is as a principle of government with regard to certain things: for instance, the governor of a state in civil matters, the commander of an army in matters of warfare, a professor in matters of learning, and so forth. Hence it is that all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are designated as "fathers," on account of their being charged with like cares: thus the servants of Naaman said to him (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse13">2 Kings 5:13</a>): "Father, if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had bid thee do some great thing," etc.

<p>Therefore, just as, in a manner, religion, whereby worship is given to find piety, whereby we worship our so under piety we find observance, whereby worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are paid to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (101, 3, ad 2), religion goes by the name of piety by way of supereminence, although piety properly so called is distinct from religion; and in the same way piety can be called observance by way of excellence, although observance properly speaking is distinct from piety.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the very fact of being in a position of dignity a man not only excels as regards his position, but also has a certain power of governing subjects, wherefore it is fitting that he should be considered as a principle inasmuch as he is the governor of others. On the other hand, the fact that a man has perfection of science and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not give him the character of a principle in relation to others, but merely a certain excellence in himself. Wherefore a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is appointed for the payment of worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity. Yet, forasmuch as science, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and all like things render a man fit for positions of dignity, the respect which is paid to anyone on account of any excellence whatever belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, properly speaking, to pay the equivalent to those to whom we owe anything. Now this cannot be done to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, and to those who make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of their position of dignity, as neither can it be done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor to our parents. Consequently these matters belong to an annexed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not to special <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> extends to the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 58, Article 6).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it belongs to observance to pay worship and honor to those who are in positions of dignity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it does not belong to observance to pay worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity. For according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x), we are said to worship those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom we hold in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, so that worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> would seem to be the same. Therefore it is unfitting to define observance as paying worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that we pay what we owe: wherefore this belongs to observance also, since it is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now we do not owe worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity, but only to those who are placed over us. Therefore observance is unfittingly defined as giving worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, not only do we owe <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of dignity who are placed over us; we owe them also fear and a certain payment of remuneration, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse7">Romans 13:7</a>, "Render . . . to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Moreover, we owe them reverence and subjection, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a>, "Obey your <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and be subject to them." Therefore observance is not fittingly defined as paying worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by observance that we pay worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to those who excel in some kind of dignity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity to govern subjects. Now to govern is to move certain ones to their due end: thus a sailor governs his ship by steering it to port. But every mover has a certain excellence and power over that which is moved. Wherefore, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in a position of dignity is an object of twofold consideration: first, in so far as he obtains excellence of position, together with a certain power over subjects: secondly, as regards the exercise of his government. On respect of his excellence there is due to him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, which is the recognition of some kind of excellence; and in respect of the exercise of his government, there is due to him worship, consisting in rendering him service, by obeying his commands, and by repaying him, according to one's faculty, for the benefits we received from him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Worship includes not only <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but also whatever other suitable actions are connected with the relations between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#80">Article 80</a>), debt is twofold. One is legal debt, to pay which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is compelled by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and worship to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity who are placed over him. The other is moral debt, which is due by reason of a certain honesty: it is in this way that we owe worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity even though we be not their subjects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Honor is due to the excellence of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity, on account of their higher rank: while fear is due to them on account of their power to use compulsion: and to the exercise of their government there is due both obedience, whereby subjects are moved at the command of their superiors, and tributes, which are a repayment of their labor.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether observance is a greater virtue than piety?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that observance is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than piety. For the prince to whom worship is paid by observance is compared to a father who is worshiped by piety, as a universal to a particular governor; because the household which a father governs is part of the state which is governed by the prince. Now a universal power is greater, and inferiors are more subject thereto. Therefore observance is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than piety.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity take care of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now our kindred pertain to the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which we ought to set aside for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: wherefore it is praiseworthy to expose oneself to the danger of death for the sake of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore observance, whereby worship is paid to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity, is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than piety, which pays worship to one's kindred.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence are due to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in the first place after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence are paid to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of observance, as stated above (1, ad 3). Therefore observance takes the first place after religion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribe acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now, immediately after the precepts of religion, which belong to the first table, follows the precept of honoring our parents which refers to piety. Therefore piety follows immediately after religion in the order of excellence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Something may be paid to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity in two ways. First, in relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as when one serves them in the administration of the affairs of the state. This no longer belongs to observance, but to piety, which pays worship not only to one's father but also to one's fatherland. Secondly, that which is paid to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity refers specially to their personal usefulness or renown, and this belongs properly to observance, as distinct from piety. Therefore in comparing observance with piety we must needs take into consideration the different relations in which other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> stand to ourselves, which relations both <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> regard. Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of our parents and of our kindred are more substantially akin to us than <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity, since birth and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, which originate in the father, belong more to one's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> than external government, the principle of which is seated in those who are in positions of dignity. For this reason piety takes precedence of observance, inasmuch as it pays worship to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> more akin to us, and to whom we are more strictly bound.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The prince is compared to the father as a universal to a particular power, as regards external government, but not as regards the father being a principle of generation: for in this way the father should be compared with the divine power from which all things derive their being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In so far as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of dignity are related to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, their worship does not pertain to observance, but to piety, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rendering of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or worship should be proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom it is paid not only as considered in himself, but also as compared to those who pay them. Wherefore, though <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, considered in themselves, are more worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> than the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of one's parents, yet children are under a greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, on account of the benefits they have received from their parents and their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> kinship with them, to pay worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to their parents than to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not of their kindred.
