<h1>Question 102. The causes of the ceremonial precepts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article1"> Was there any cause for the ceremonial precepts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article2"> Was the cause of the ceremonial precepts literal or figurative?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article3"> The causes of the sacrifices</a> <li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article4"> The causes of the holy things</a> <li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article5"> The causes of the sacraments of the Old Law</a> <li><a href="../summa/2102.htm#article6"> The causes of the observances</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there was any cause for the ceremonial precepts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the ceremonial precepts. Because on <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse15">Ephesians 2:15</a>, "Making void the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the commandments," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, (i.e.) "making void the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> as to the carnal observances, by substituting decrees, i.e. evangelical precepts, which are based on reason." But if the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were based on reason, it would have been useless to void them by the reasonable decrees of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore there was no reason for the ceremonial observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> succeeded the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there was a precept for which there was no reason save that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> obedience might be tested; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 6,13), concerning the prohibition about the tree of life. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there should have been some precepts for the purpose of testing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> obedience, having no reason in themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> works are called moral according as they proceed from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. If therefore there is any reason for the ceremonial precepts, they would not differ from the moral precepts. It seems therefore that there was no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the ceremonial precepts: for the reason of a precept is taken from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse9">Psalm 18:9</a>): "The commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes." But the ceremonial precepts are commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore they are lightsome: and yet they would not be so, if they had no reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore the ceremonial precepts have a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i, 2), it is the function of a "wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do everything in order," those things which proceed from the Divine wisdom must needs be well ordered, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>). Now there are two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for things to be well ordered. First, that they be ordained to their due end, which is the principle of the whole order in matters of action: since those things that happen by chance outside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end, or which are not done seriously but for fun, are said to be inordinate. Secondly, that which is done in view of the end should be proportionate to the end. From this it follows that the reason for whatever conduces to the end is taken from the end: thus the reason for the disposition of a saw is taken from cutting, which is its end, as stated in Phys. ii, 9. Now it is evident that the ceremonial precepts, like all the other precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, were institutions of Divine wisdom: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>): "This is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Consequently we must needs say that the ceremonial precepts were ordained to a certain end, wherefrom their reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> can be gathered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It may be said there was no reason for the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, in the sense that there was no reason in the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing done: for instance that a garment should not be made of wool and linen. But there could be a reason for them in relation to something else: namely, in so far as something was signified or excluded thereby. On the other hand, the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which refer chiefly to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are reasonable from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason for the prohibition concerning the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was not that this tree was <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and yet this prohibition was reasonable in its relation to something else, in as much as it signified something. And so also the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were reasonable on account of their relation to something else.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The moral precepts in their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> have reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: as for instance, "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal." But the ceremonial precepts have a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in their relation to something else, as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the ceremonial precepts have a literal cause or merely a figurative cause?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonial precepts have not a literal, but merely a figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For among the ceremonial precepts, the chief was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the sacrifice of the paschal lamb. But neither of these had any but a figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: because each was given as a sign. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse11">Genesis 17:11</a>): "You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be a sign of the covenant between Me and you": and of the celebration of the Passover it is written (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse9">Exodus 13:9</a>): "It shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a memorial before thy eyes." Therefore much more did the other ceremonial precepts have none but a figurative reason.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an effect is proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But all the ceremonial precepts are figurative, as stated above (Question 101, Article 2). Therefore they have no other than a figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it be a matter of indifference whether a certain thing, considered in itself, be done in a particular way or not, it seems that it has not a literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now there are certain points in the ceremonial precepts, which appear to be a matter of indifference, as to whether they be done in one way or in another: for instance, the number of animals to be offered, and other such particular circumstances. Therefore there is no literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Just as the ceremonial precepts foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so did the stories of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>) that "all (these things) happened to them in figure." Now in the stories of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, besides the mystical or figurative, there is the literal sense. Therefore the ceremonial precepts had also literal, besides their figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the reason for whatever conduces to an end must be taken from that end. Now the end of the ceremonial precepts was twofold: for they were ordained to the Divine worship, for that particular time, and to the foreshadowing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; just as the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarded the time being in such a way as to be utterances figurative of the time to come, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse3">Hosea 1:3</a>. Accordingly the reasons for the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> can be taken in two ways. First, in respect of the Divine worship which was to be observed for that particular time: and these reasons are literal: whether they refer to the shunning of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; or recall certain Divine benefits; or remind men of the Divine excellence; or point out the disposition of mind which was then required in those who worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, their reasons can be gathered from the point of view of their being ordained to foreshadow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and thus their reasons are figurative and mystical: whether they be taken from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which pertains to the allegorical sense; or to the morals of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, which pertains to the moral sense; or to the state of future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in as much as we are brought thereto by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which refers to the anagogical sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the use of metaphorical expressions in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> belongs to the literal sense, because the words are employed in order to convey that particular meaning; so also the meaning of those legal ceremonies which commemorated certain Divine benefits, on account of which they were instituted, and of others similar which belonged to that time, does not go beyond the order of literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Consequently when we assert that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the celebration of the Passover was its signification of the delivery from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was a sign of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> covenant with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, we assign the literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would avail if the ceremonial precepts had been given merely as figures of things to come, and not for the purpose of worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then and there.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we have stated when speaking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws (96, A1,6), there is a reason for them in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but not in regard to particular <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, which depend on the judgment of those who frame them; so also many particular determinations in the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> have no literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only a figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; whereas in the abstract they have a literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a suitable cause can be assigned for the ceremonies which pertained to sacrifices?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no suitable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be assigned for the ceremonies pertaining to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For those things which were offered in sacrifice, are those which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for sustaining <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life: such as certain animals and certain loaves. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> needs no such sustenance; according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse13">Psalm 49:13</a>: "Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? Or shall I drink the blood of goats?" Therefore such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were unfittingly offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, only three kinds of quadrupeds were offered in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz. oxen, sheep and goats; of birds, generally the turtledove and the dove; but specially, in the cleansing of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, an offering was made of sparrows. Now many other animals are more noble than these. Since therefore whatever is best should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that not only of these three should <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> have been offered to Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the dominion over birds and beasts, so also has he received dominion over fishes. Consequently it was unfitting for fishes to be excluded from the divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, turtledoves and doves indifferently are commanded to be offered up. Since then the young of the dove are commanded to be offered, so also should the young of the turtledove.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Author of life, not only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also of animals, as is clear from <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse20">Genesis 1:20</a>, seqq. Now death is opposed to life. Therefore it was fitting that living animals rather than slain animals should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> admonishes us (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a>), to present our bodies "a living sacrifice, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, pleasing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, if none but slain animals were offered in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that it mattered not how they were slain. Therefore it was unfitting that the manner of immolation should be determined, especially as regards birds (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm#verse15">Leviticus 1:15, seqq.</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, every defect in an animal is a step towards corruption and death. If therefore slain animals were offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was unreasonable to forbid the offering of an imperfect animal, e.g. a lame, or a blind, or otherwise defective animal.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, those who offer victims to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should partake thereof, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>): "Are not they that eat of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> partakers of the altar?" It was therefore unbecoming for the offerers to be denied certain parts of the victims, namely, the blood, the fat, the breastbone and the right shoulder.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, just as holocausts were offered up in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also were the peace-offerings and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>-offerings. But no female animals was offered up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, although holocausts were offered of both quadrupeds and birds. Therefore it was inconsistent that female animals should be offered up in peace-offerings and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>-offerings, and that nevertheless birds should not be offered up in peace-offerings.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, all the peace-offerings seem to be of one kind. Therefore it was unfitting to make a distinction among them, so that it was forbidden to eat the flesh of certain peace-offerings on the following day, while it was allowed to eat the flesh of other peace-offerings, as laid down in <a href="../bible/lev007.htm#verse15">Leviticus 7:15</a>, seqq.

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> agree in turning us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, in order to reconcile us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one kind of sacrifice should have been offered up for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, all animals that were offered up in sacrifice, were offered up in one way, viz. slain. Therefore it does not seem to be suitable that products of the soil should be offered up in various ways; for sometimes an offering was made of ears of corn, sometimes of flour, sometimes of bread, this being baked sometimes in an oven, sometimes in a pan, sometimes on a gridiron.

<p><strong>Objection 13.</strong> Further, whatever things are serviceable to us should be recognized as coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It was therefore unbecoming that besides animals, nothing but bread, wine, oil, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and salt should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 14.</strong> Further, bodily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> denote the inward sacrifice of the heart, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offers his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in the inward sacrifice, the sweetness, which is denoted by honey, surpasses the pungency which salt represents; for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse27">Sirach 24:27</a>): "My spirit is sweet above honey." Therefore it was unbecoming that the use of honey, and of leaven which makes bread savory, should be forbidden in a sacrifice; while the use was prescribed, of salt which is pungent, and of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> which has a bitter taste. Consequently it seems that things pertaining to the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> have no reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm#verse13">Leviticus 1:13</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar, for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and most sweet savor to the Lord." Now according to <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse28">Wisdom 7:28</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom": whence it seems to follow that whatever is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is wisely done. Therefore these ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were wisely done, as having reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. a literal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according as they were intended for Divine worship; and a figurative or mystical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, according as they were intended to foreshadow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and on either hand the ceremonies pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> can be assigned to a fitting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>For, according as the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were intended for the divine worship, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> can be taken in two ways. First, in so far as the sacrifice represented the directing of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which the offerer of the sacrifice was stimulated. Now in order to direct his mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> aright, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must recognize that whatever he has is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from its first principle, and direct it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its last end. This was denoted in the offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, by the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> offered some of his own belongings in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though in recognition of his having received them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the saying of David (<a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#verse14">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>): "All things are Thine: and we have given Thee what we received of Thy hand." Wherefore in offering up <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> made protestation that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first principle of the creation of all things, and their last end, to which all things must be directed. And since, for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to be directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> aright, it must recognize no first author of things other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor place its end in any other; for this reason it was forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to offer sacrifice to any other but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus 22:20</a>: "He that sacrificeth to gods, shall be put to death, save only to the Lord." Wherefore another reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may be assigned to the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, from the fact that thereby men were withdrawn from offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Hence too it is that the precepts about the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were not given to the Jewish people until after they had fallen into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, by worshipping the molten calf: as though those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were instituted, that the people, being ready to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, might offer those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse22">Jeremiah 7:22</a>): "I spake not to your fathers and I commanded them not, in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>."

<p>Now of all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> after they had fallen away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the chief is that He gave His Son; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John 3:16</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world, as to give His only-begotten Son; that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting." Consequently the chief sacrifice is that whereby <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself "delivered Himself . . . to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odor of sweetness" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians 5:2</a>). And for this reason all the other <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were offered up in order to foreshadow this one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and paramount sacrifice--the imperfect forecasting the perfect. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse11">Hebrews 10:11</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> "often" offered "the same <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which can never take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered "one sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for ever." And since the reason of the figure is taken from that which the figure represents, therefore the reasons of the figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should be taken from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not wish these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be offered to Him on account of the things themselves that were offered, as though He stood in need of them: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse11">Isaiah 1:11</a>): "I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves and lambs and buckgoats." But, as stated above, He wished them to be offered to Him, in order to prevent <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; in order to signify the right ordering of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in order to represent the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In all the respects mentioned above (ad 1), there was a suitable reason for these animals, rather than others, being offered in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. First, in order to prevent <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Because idolaters offered all other animals to their gods, or made use of them in their sorceries: while the Egyptians (among whom the people had been dwelling) considered it abominable to slay these animals, wherefore they used not to offer them in sacrifice to their gods. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse26">Exodus 8:26</a>): "We shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For they worshipped the sheep; they reverenced the ram (because <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> appeared under the form thereof); while they employed oxen for agriculture, which was reckoned by them as something sacred.

<p>Secondly, this was suitable for the aforesaid right ordering of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and in two ways. First, because it is chiefly by means of these animals that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is sustained: and moreover they are most clean, and partake of a most clean food: whereas other animals are either wild, and not deputed to ordinary use among men: or, if they be tame, they have <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> food, as pigs and geese: and nothing but what is clean should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These birds especially were offered in sacrifice because there were plenty of them in the land of promise. Secondly, because the sacrificing of these animals represented purity of heart. Because as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/lev001.htm">Leviticus 1</a>, "We offer a calf, when we overcome the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the flesh; a lamb, when we restrain our unreasonable motions; a goat, when we conquer wantonness; a turtledove, when we keep chaste; unleavened bread, when we feast on the unleavened bread of sincerity." And it is evident that the dove denotes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and simplicity of heart.

<p>Thirdly, it was fitting that these animals should be offered, that they might foreshadow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is offered in the calf, to denote the strength of the cross; in the lamb, to signify His innocence; in the ram, to foreshadow His headship; and in the goat, to signify the likeness of '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh' [An allusion to <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11</a> (Textus Receptus)]. The turtledove and dove denoted the union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>"; or else the turtledove signified <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; while the dove was a figure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. "The wheat-flour foreshadowed the sprinkling of believers with the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fish through living in water are further removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than other animals, which, like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, live in the air. Again, fish die as soon as they are taken out of water; hence they could not be offered in the temple like other animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Among turtledoves the older ones are better than the young; while with doves the case is the reverse. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> observes (Doct. Perplex. iii), turtledoves and young doves are commanded to be offered, because nothing should be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but what is best.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The animals which were offered in sacrifice were slain, because it is by being killed that they become useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for food. Wherefore also they were burnt with fire: because it is by being cooked that they are made fit for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> consumption. Moreover the slaying of the animals signified the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and also that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserved death on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as though those animals were slain in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> stead, in order to betoken the expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Again the slaying of these animals signified the slaying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The Law fixed the special manner of slaying the sacrificial animals in order to exclude other ways of killing, whereby idolaters sacrificed animals to idols. Or again, as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> says (Doct. Perplex. iii), "the Law chose that manner of slaying which was least painful to the slain animal." This excluded cruelty on the part of the offerers, and any mangling of the animals slain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> It is because <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> animals are wont to be held in contempt among men, that it was forbidden to offer them in sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and for this reason too they were forbidden (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>) to offer "the hire of a strumpet or the price of a dog in the house of . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For the same reason they did not offer animals before the seventh day, because such were abortive as it were, the flesh being not yet firm on account of its exceeding softness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> There were three kinds of sacrifices. There was one in which the victim was entirely consumed by fire: this was called "a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, i.e. all burnt." For this kind of sacrifice was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> specially to show reverence to His majesty, and love of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: and typified the state of perfection as regards the fulfilment of the counsels. Wherefore the whole was burnt up: so that as the whole animal by being dissolved into vapor soared aloft, so it might denote that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and whatever belongs to him, are subject to the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should be offered to Him.

<p>Another sacrifice was the "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>-offering," which was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> need for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and this typifies the state of penitents in satisfying for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. It was divided into two parts: for one part was burnt; while the other was granted to the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to signify that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the ministry of His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. When, however, this sacrifice was offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the whole people, or specially for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the whole victim was burnt up. For it was not fitting that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should have the use of that which was offered for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to signify that nothing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> should remain in them. Moreover, this would not be satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for if the offering were granted to the use of those for whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it was offered, it would seem to be the same as if it had not been offered.

<p>The third kind of sacrifice was called the "peace-offering," which was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either in thanksgiving, or for the welfare and prosperity of the offerers, in acknowledgment of benefits already received or yet to be received: and this typifies the state of those who are proficient in the observance of the commandments. These <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were divided into three parts: for one part was burnt in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; another part was allotted to the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and the third part to the use of the offerers; in order to signify that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the direction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers, and through the cooperation of those who are saved.

<p>But it was the universal rule that the blood and fat were not allotted to the use either of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or of the offerers: the blood being poured out at the foot of the altar, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the fat was burnt upon the altar (<a href="../bible/lev009.htm#verse9">Leviticus 9:9-10</a>). The reason for this was, first, in order to prevent <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: because idolaters used to drink the blood and eat the fat of the victims, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse38">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>: "Of whose victims they eat the fat, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings." Secondly, in order to form them to a right way of living. For they were forbidden the use of the blood that they might abhor the shedding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse4">Genesis 9:4-5</a>): "Flesh with blood you shall not eat: for I will require the blood of your lives": and they were forbidden to eat the fat, in order to withdraw them from lasciviousness; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 34:3</a>): "You have killed that which was fat." Thirdly, on account of the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because blood is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for life, for which reason "life" is said to be "in the blood" (<a href="../bible/lev017.htm#verse11">Leviticus 17:11-14</a>): while fat is a sign of abundant nourishment. Wherefore, in order to show that to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we owe both life and a sufficiency of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, the blood was poured out, and the fat burnt up in His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Fourthly, in order to foreshadow the shedding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood, and the abundance of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby He offered Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us.

<p>In the peace-offerings, the breast-bone and the right shoulder were allotted to the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in order to prevent a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as "spatulamantia," so called because it was customary in divining to use the shoulder-blade [spatula], and the breast-bone of the animals offered in sacrifice; wherefore these things were taken away from the offerers. This is also denoted the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> need of wisdom in the heart, to instruct the people--this was signified by the breast-bone, which covers the heart; and his need of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in order to bear with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty--and this was signified by the right shoulder.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> was the most perfect kind of sacrifice, therefore none but a male was offered for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>: because the female is an imperfect animal. The offering of turtledoves and doves was on account of the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of the offerers, who were unable to offer bigger animals. And since peace-victims were offered freely, and no one was bound to offer them against his will, hence these birds were offered not among the peace-victims, but among the holocausts and victims for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to offer at times. Moreover these birds, on account of their lofty flight, while befitting the perfection of the holocausts: and were suitable for sin-offerings because their song is doleful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> was the chief of all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: because all were burnt in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and nothing of it was eaten. The second place in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, belongs to the sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which was eaten in the court only, and on the very day of the sacrifice (<a href="../bible/lev007.htm#verse6">Leviticus 7:6-15</a>). The third place must be given to the peace-offerings of thanksgiving, which were eaten on the same day, but anywhere in Jerusalem. Fourth in order were the "ex-voto" peace-offerings, the flesh of which could be eaten even on the morrow. The reason for this order is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, chiefly on account of His majesty; secondly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has committed; thirdly, because of the benefits he has already received from Him; fourthly, by reason of the benefits he hopes to receive from Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are more grievous by reason of the state of the sinner, as stated above (Question 73, Article 10): wherefore different victims are commanded to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or of a prince, or of some other private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. "But," as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> says (Doct. Perplex. iii), "we must take note that the more grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the lower the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of animals offered for it. Wherefore the goat, which is a very base animal, was offered for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; while a calf was offered for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and a ram for the negligence of a prince."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> the Law had in view the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of the offerers; so that those who could not have a four-footed animal at their disposal, might at least offer a bird; and that he who could not have a bird might at least offer bread; and that if a man had not even bread he might offer flour or ears of corn.

<p>The figurative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is that the bread signifies <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who is the "living bread" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse41">John 6:41-51</a>). He was indeed an ear of corn, as it were, during the state of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the patriarchs; He was like flour in the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and He was like perfect bread after He had taken <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; baked in the fire, i.e. formed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the oven of the virginal womb; baked again in a pan by the toils which He suffered in the world; and consumed by fire on the cross as on a gridiron.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 13.</strong> The products of the soil are useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, either as food, and of these bread was offered; or as drink, and of these wine was offered; or as seasoning, and of these oil and salt were offered; or as healing, and of these they offered <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, which both smells sweetly and binds easily together.

<p>Now the bread foreshadowed the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and the wine, His blood, whereby we were redeemed; oil betokens the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; salt, His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 14.</strong> Honey was not offered in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both because it was wont to be offered in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and in order to denote the absence of all carnal sweetness and pleasure from those who intend to sacrifice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Leaven was not offered, to denote the exclusion of corruption. Perhaps too, it was wont to be offered in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.

<p>Salt, however, was offered, because it wards off the corruption of putrefaction: for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be incorrupt. Moreover, salt signifies the discretion of wisdom, or again, mortification of the flesh.

<p><a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">Incense</a> was offered to denote devotion of the heart, which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the offerer; and again, to signify the odor of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>: for <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, both rich and fragrant. And since the sacrifice "of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>" did not proceed from devotion, but rather from suspicion, therefore <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> was not offered therein (<a href="../bible/num005.htm#verse15">Numbers 5:15</a>).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sufficient reason can be assigned for the ceremonies pertaining to holy things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no sufficient reason can be assigned for the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> that pertain to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse24">Acts 17:24</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who made the world and all things therein; He being Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, dwelleth not in temples made by hands." It was therefore unfitting that in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> a tabernacle or temple should be set up for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not changed except by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the tabernacle denoted the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Therefore it should not have been changed by the building of a temple.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Divine Law, more than any other indeed, should lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But an increase of divine worship requires multiplication of altars and temples; as is evident in regard to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore it seems that also under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there should have been not only one tabernacle or temple, but many.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the tabernacle or temple was ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we should worship above all His unity and simplicity. Therefore it seems unbecoming for the tabernacle or temple to be divided by means of veils.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the power of the First Mover, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, appears first of all in the east, for it is in that quarter that the first movement begins. But the tabernacle was set up for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it should have been built so as to point to the east rather than the west.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse4">Exodus 20:4</a>) that they should "not make . . . a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything." It was therefore unfitting for graven images of the cherubim to be set up in the tabernacle or temple. In like manner, the ark, the propitiatory, the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>, the table, the two altars, seem to have been placed there without reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse24">Exodus 20:24</a>): "You shall make an altar of earth unto Me": and again (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse26">Exodus 20:26</a>): "Thou shalt not go up by steps unto My altar." It was therefore unfitting that subsequently they should be commanded to make an altar of wood laid over with gold or brass; and of such a height that it was impossible to go up to it except by steps. For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo027.htm#verse1">Exodus 27:1-2</a>): "Thou shalt make also an altar of setim wood, which shall be five cubits long, and as many broad . . . and three cubits high . . . and thou shalt cover it with brass": and (<a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse1">Exodus 30:1-3</a>): "Thou shalt make . . . an altar to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, of setim wood . . . and thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold."

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works nothing should be superfluous; for not even in the works of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is anything superfluous to be found. But one cover suffices for one tabernacle or house. Therefore it was unbecoming to furnish the tabernacle with many coverings, viz. curtains, curtains of goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and violet-colored skins (<a href="../bible/exo026.htm">Exodus 26</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, exterior <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> signifies interior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the subject of which is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It was therefore unsuitable for the tabernacle and its vessels to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, since they were inanimate things.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse2">Psalm 33:2</a>): "I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Lord at all times, His praise shall always be in my mouth." But the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> festivals were instituted for the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it was not fitting that certain days should be fixed for keeping <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> festivals; so that it seems that there was no suitable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the ceremonies relating to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse4">Hebrews 8:4</a>) that those who "offer <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> . . . serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See, says He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shown thee on the mount." But that is most reasonable, which presents a likeness to heavenly things. Therefore the ceremonies relating to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things had a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The chief purpose of the whole external worship is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may give worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> tendency is to reverence less those things which are common, and indistinct from other things; whereas he admires and reveres those things which are distinct from others in some point of excellence. Hence too it is customary among men for kings and princes, who ought to be reverenced by their subjects, to be clothed in more precious garments, and to possess vaster and more beautiful abodes. And for this reason it behooved special times, a special abode, special vessels, and special ministers to be appointed for the divine worship, so that thereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might be brought to greater reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>In like manner the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as observed above (2; 100, 12; 101, 2), was instituted that it might foreshadow the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now that which foreshadows something should be determinate, so that it may present some likeness thereto. Consequently, certain special points had to be observed in matters pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The divine worship regards two things: namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is worshipped; and men, who worship Him. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is worshipped, is confined to no bodily place: wherefore there was no need, on His part, for a tabernacle or temple to be set up. But men, who worship Him, are corporeal beings: and for their sake there was need for a special tabernacle or temple to be set up for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for two reasons. First, that through coming together with the thought that the place was set aside for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they might approach thither with greater reverence. Secondly, that certain things relating to the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> might be signified by the arrangement of various details in such temple or tabernacle.

<p>To this Solomon refers (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse27">1 Kings 8:27</a>) when he says: "If <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the heavens of heavens cannot contain Thee, how much less this house which I have built" for Thee? And further on (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse29">1 Kings 8:29-30</a>) he adds: "That Thy eyes may be open upon this house . . . of which Thou hast said: My name shall be there; . . . that Thou mayest hearken to the supplication of Thy servant and of Thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." From this it is evident that the house of the sanctuary was set up, not in order to contain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as abiding therein locally, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> there by means of things done and said there; and that those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> there might, through reverence for the place, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> more devoutly, so as to be heard more readily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was not changed as regards the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which was effected in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone: but it was changed as regards the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the people that were under the Law. Because, at first, the people were in the desert, having no fixed abode: afterwards they were engaged in various <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the neighboring <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; and lastly, at the time of David and Solomon, the state of that people was one of great peace. And then for the first time the temple was built in the place which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, instructed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had chosen for the purpose of sacrifice. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse2">Genesis 22:2</a>) that the Lord commanded <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to "offer" his son "for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> upon one of the mountains which I will show thee": and it is related further on (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse14">Genesis 22:14</a>) that "he calleth the name of that place, The Lord seeth," as though, according to the Divine prevision, that place were chosen for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 12:5-6</a>): "You shall come to the place which the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall choose . . . and you shall offer . . . your holocausts and victims."

<p>Now it was not meet for that place to be pointed out by the building of the temple before the aforesaid time; for three reasons assigned by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>. First, lest the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might seize hold of that place. Secondly, lest the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might destroy it. The third reason is lest each tribe might wish that place to fall to their lot, and strifes and quarrels be the result. Hence the temple was not built until they had a king who would be able to quell such quarrels. Until that time a portable tabernacle was employed for divine worship, no place being as yet fixed for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is the literal reason for the distinction between the tabernacle and the temple.

<p>The figurative reason may be assigned to the fact that they signify a twofold state. For the tabernacle, which was changeable, signifies the state of the present changeable life: whereas the temple, which was fixed and stable, signifies the state of future life which is altogether unchangeable. For this reason it is said that in the building of the temple no sound was heard of hammer or saw, to signify that all movements of disturbance will be far removed from the future state. Or else the tabernacle signifies the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; while the temple built by Solomon betokens the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> alone worked at the building of the tabernacle; whereas the temple was built with the cooperation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, viz. the Tyrians and Sidonians.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason for the unity of the temple or tabernacle may be either literal or figurative. The literal reason was the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> put up various times to various gods: and so, to strengthen in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the unity of the Godhead, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be offered to Him in one place only. Another reason was in order to show that bodily worship is not acceptable of itself: and so they restrained from offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> anywhere and everywhere. But the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, in the sacrifice whereof <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is contained, is of itself acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently the multiplication of altars and temples is permitted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p>As to those matters that regarded the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consisting in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the Prophets, there were, even under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, various places, called synagogues, appointed for the people to gather together for the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as now there are places called churches in which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people gather together for the divine worship. Thus our church takes the place of both temple and <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: since the very sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>; wherefore with us the place of sacrifice is not distinct from the place of teaching. The figurative reason may be that hereby is signified the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whether militant or triumphant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as the unity of the temple or tabernacle betokened the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so also the division of the tabernacle or temple signified the distinction of those things that are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from which we arise to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the tabernacle was divided into two parts: one was called the "Holy of Holies," and was placed to the west; the other was called the "Holy Place" [Or 'Sanctuary'. The <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> uses both expressions], which was situated to the east. Moreover there was a court facing the tabernacle. Accordingly there are two reasons for this distinction. One is in respect of the tabernacle being ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because the different parts of the world are thus betokened by the division of the tabernacle. For that part which was called the Holy of Holies signified the higher world, which is that of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>: while that part which is called the Holy Place signified the corporeal world. Hence the Holy Place was separated from the Holy of Holies by a veil, which was of four different colors (denoting the four elements), viz. of linen, signifying earth, because linen, i.e. flax, grows out of the earth; purple, signifying water, because the purple tint was made from certain shells found in the sea; violet, signifying air, because it has the color of the air; and scarlet twice dyed, signifying fire: and this because <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> composed of the four elements is a veil between us and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> alone, and that once a year, entered into the inner tabernacle, i.e. the Holy of Holies: whereby we are taught that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> final perfection consists in his entering into that (higher) world: whereas into the outward tabernacle, i.e. the Holy Place, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> entered every day: whereas the people were only admitted to the court; because the people were able to perceived material things, the inner <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which only wise men by dint of study are able to discover.

<p>But regard to the figurative reason, the outward tabernacle, which was called the Holy Place, betokened the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse6">Hebrews 9:6, seqq.</a>): because into that tabernacle "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> always entered accomplishing the offices of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>." But the inner tabernacle, which was called the Holy of Holies, signified either the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> to come. To the latter state <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> brought us; and this was signified by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> entering alone, once a year, into the Holy of Holies. The veil betokened the concealing of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> under the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of old. This veil was adorned with four colors: viz. that of linen, to designate purity of the flesh; purple, to denote the sufferings which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> underwent for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; scarlet twice dyed, signifying the twofold love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor; and violet, in token of heavenly <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. With regard to the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the people and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were situated differently from one another. For the people saw the mere corporeal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which were offered in the court: whereas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were intent on the inner meaning of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, because their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was more explicit. Hence they entered into the outer tabernacle. This outer tabernacle was divided from the court by a veil; because some matters relating to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were hidden from the people, while they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: though they were not fully revealed to them, as they were subsequently in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Worship towards the west was introduced in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: because all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in reverence to the sun, worshipped towards the east; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eze008.htm#verse16">Ezekiel 8:16</a>) that certain men "had their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces to the east, and they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> towards the rising of the sun." Accordingly, in order to prevent this, the tabernacle had the Holy of Holies to westward, that they might <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> toward the west. A figurative reason may also be found in the fact that the whole state of the first tabernacle was ordained to foreshadow the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is signified by the west, according to <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse5">Psalm 67:5</a>: "Who ascendeth unto the west; the Lord is His name."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Both literal and figurative reasons may be assigned for the things contained in the tabernacle. The literal reason is in connection with the divine worship. And because, as already observed (ad 4), the inner tabernacle, called the Holy of Holies, signified the higher world of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, hence that tabernacle contained three things, viz. "the ark of the testament in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> that had blossomed, and the tables" (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse4">Hebrews 9:4</a>) on which were written the ten commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Now the ark stood between two "cherubim" that looked one towards the other: and over the ark was a table, called the "propitiatory," raised above the wings of the cherubim, as though it were held up by them; and appearing, to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, to be the very seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason it was called the "propitiatory," as though the people received propitiation thence at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>. And so it was held up, so to speak, by the cherubim, in obedience, as it were, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: while the ark of the testament was like the foot-stool to Him that sat on the propitiatory. These three things denote three things in that higher world: namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is above all, and incomprehensible to any creature. Hence no likeness of Him was set up; to denote His invisibility. But there was something to represent his seat; since, to wit, the creature, which is beneath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the seat under the sitter, is comprehensible. Again in that higher world there are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. These are signified by the two cherubim, looking one towards the other, to show that they are at peace with one another, according to <a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse2">Job 25:2</a>: "Who maketh peace in . . . high places." For this reason, too, there was more than one cherub, to betoken the multitude of heavenly spirits, and to prevent their receiving worship from those who had been commanded to worship but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover there are, enclosed as it were in that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> world, the intelligible types of whatsoever takes place in this world, just as in every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are enclosed the types of its effects, and in the craftsman the types of the works of his craft. This was betokened by the ark, which represented, by means of the three things it contained, the three things of greatest import in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. These are wisdom, signified by the tables of the testament; the power of governing, betokened by the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>; and life, betokened by the manna which was the means of sustenance. Or else these three things signified the three Divine attributes, viz. wisdom, in the tables; power, in the rod; <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, in the manna--both by reason of its sweetness, and because it was through the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that it was granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherefore it was preserved as a memorial of the Divine mercy. Again, these three things were represented in Isaiah' vision. For he "saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated"; and the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">seraphim</a> standing by; and that the house was filled with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord; wherefrom the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">seraphim</a> cried out: "All the earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>). And so the images of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">seraphim</a> were set up, not to be worshipped, for this was forbidden by the first commandment; but as a sign of their function, as stated above.

<p>The outer tabernacle, which denotes this present world, also contained three things, viz. the "altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>," which was directly opposite the ark; the "table of proposition," with the twelve loaves of proposition on it, which stood on the northern side; and the "<a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>," which was placed towards the south. These three things seem to correspond to the three which were enclosed in the ark; and they represented the same things as the latter, but more clearly: because, in order that wise men, denoted by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> entering the temple, might grasp the meaning of these types, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to express them more manifestly than they are in the Divine or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> betokened, as a sensible sign thereof, the wisdom which was expressed on the tables (of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>) in intelligible words. The altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> signified the office of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to bring the people to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and this was signified also by the rod: because on that altar the sweet-smelling <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> was burnt, signifying the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the people acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/rev008.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 8:3</a>) that the smoke of the sweet-smelling spices signifies the "justifications of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse8">Apocalypse 19:8</a>). Moreover it was fitting that the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> should be denoted, in the ark, by the rod, and, in the outer tabernacle, by the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people, governing the people by Divine power, denoted by the rod; and offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the fruit of His government, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the people, on the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, so to speak. The table signified the sustenance of life, just as the manna did: but the former, a more general and a coarser kind of nourishment; the latter, a sweeter and more delicate. Again, the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> was fittingly placed on the southern side, while the table was placed to the north: because the south is the right-hand side of the world, while the north is the left-hand side, as stated in De Coelo et Mundo ii; and wisdom, like other <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, belongs to the right hand, while temporal nourishment belongs on the left, according to <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse16">Proverbs 3:16</a>: "In her left hand (are) <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power is midway between temporal goods and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wisdom; because thereby both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wisdom and temporal goods are dispensed.

<p>Another literal signification may be assigned. For the ark contained the tables of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, in order to prevent forgetfulness of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse12">Exodus 24:12</a>): "I will give thee two tables of stone, and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and the commandments which I have written: that thou mayest teach them" to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was placed there to restrain the people from insubordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/num017.htm#verse10">Numbers 17:10</a>): "Carry back the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> into the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." The manna was kept in the ark to remind them of the benefit conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the desert; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse32">Exodus 16:32</a>): "Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto generations to come hereafter, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness." The <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> was set up to enhance the beauty of the temple, for the magnificence of a house depends on its being well lighted. Now the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> had seven branches, as <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> observes (Antiquit. iii, 7,8), to signify the seven planets, wherewith the whole world is illuminated. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> was placed towards the south; because for us the course of the planets is from that quarter. The altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> was instituted that there might always be in the tabernacle a sweet-smelling smoke; both through respect for the tabernacle, and as a remedy for the stenches arising from the shedding of blood and the slaying of animals. For men despise evil-smelling things as being vile, whereas sweet-smelling things are much appreciated. The table was place there to signify that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who served the temple should take their food in the temple: wherefore, as stated in <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse4">Matthew 12:4</a>, it was lawful for none but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to eat the twelve loaves which were put on the table in memory of the twelve tribes. And the table was not placed in the middle directly in front of the propitiatory, in order to exclude an idolatrous rite: for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, on the feasts of the moon, set up a table in front of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of the moon, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse18">Jeremiah 7:18</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p>In the court outside the tabernacle was the altar of holocausts, on which <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of those things which the people possessed were offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently the people who offered these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could be present in the court. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone, whose function it was to offer the people to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, could approach the inner altar, whereon the very devotion and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the people was offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this altar was put up outside the tabernacle and in the court, to the exclusion of idolatrous worship: for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> placed altars inside the temples to offer up <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> thereon to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.

<p>The figurative reason for all these things may be taken from the relation of the tabernacle to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was foreshadowed therein. Now it must be observed that to show the imperfection of the figures of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, various figures were instituted in the temple to betoken <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He was foreshadowed by the "propitiatory," since He is "a propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>). This propitiatory was fittingly carried by cherubim, since of Him it is written (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse6">Hebrews 1:6</a>): "Let all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Him." He is also signified by the ark: because just as the ark was made of setim-wood, so was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body composed of most pure members. More over it was gilded: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was full of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which are betokened by gold. And in the ark was a golden pot, i.e. His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, having manna, i.e. "all the fulness of the Godhead" (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians 2:9</a>). Also there was a rod in the ark, i.e. His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power: for "He was made a . . . <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever" (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse20">Hebrews 6:20</a>). And therein were the tables of the Testament, to denote that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is a lawgiver. Again, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was signified by the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>, for He said Himself (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John 8:12</a>): "I am the Light of the world"; while the seven lamps denoted the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. He is also betokened in the table, because He is our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> food, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse41">John 6:41-51</a>: "I am the living bread": and the twelve loaves signified the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or their teaching. Or again, the <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a> and table may signify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which also enlightens and refreshes. Again, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is signified by the two altars of holocausts and incense. Because all works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must be offered to us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Him; both those whereby we afflict the body, which are offered, as it were, on the altar of holocausts; and those which, with greater perfection of mind, are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> desires of the perfect, on the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, as it were, according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse15">Hebrews 13:15</a>: "By Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The Lord commanded an altar to be made for the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for the upkeep of the ministers who served the tabernacle. Now concerning the construction of the altar the Lord issued a twofold precept. One was at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse24">Exodus 20:24, seqq.</a>) when the Lord commanded them to make "an altar of earth," or at least "not of hewn stones"; and again, not to make the altar high, so as to make it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to "go up" to it "by steps." This was in detestation of idolatrous worship: for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> made their altars ornate and high, thinking that there was something <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine in such things. For this reason, too, the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse21">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>): "Thou shalt plant no grove, nor any tree near the altar of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>": since idolaters were wont to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> beneath trees, on account of the pleasantness and shade afforded by them. There was also a figurative reason for these precepts. Because we must confess that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is our altar, there is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh, as regards His humanity--and this is to make an altar of earth; and again, in regard to His Godhead, we must confess His equality with the Father--and this is "not to go up" to the altar by steps. Moreover we should not couple the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which provokes men to lewdness.

<p>But when once the tabernacle had been constructed to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there was no longer reason to fear these occasions of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Wherefore the Lord commanded the altar of holocausts to be made of brass, and to be conspicuous to all the people; and the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, which was visible to none but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Nor was brass so precious as to give the people an occasion for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p>Since, however, the reason for the precept, "Thou shalt not go up by steps unto My altar" (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse26">Exodus 20:26</a>) is stated to have been "lest thy nakedness be discovered," it should be observed that this too was instituted with the purpose of preventing <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, for in the feasts of Priapus the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> uncovered their nakedness before the people. But later on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were prescribed the use of loin-cloths for the sake of decency: so that without any danger the altar could be placed so high that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> would go up by steps of wood, not fixed but movable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The body of the tabernacle consisted of boards placed on end, and covered on the inside with curtains of four different colors, viz. twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed. These curtains, however, covered the sides only of the tabernacle; and the roof of the tabernacle was covered with violet-colored skins; and over this there was another covering of rams' skins dyed red; and over this there was a third curtain made of goats' hair, which covered not only the roof of the tabernacle, but also reached to the ground and covered the boards of the tabernacle on the outside. The literal reason of these coverings taken altogether was the adornment and protection of the tabernacle, that it might be an object of respect. Taken singly, according to some, the curtains denoted the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is adorned with various stars; the curtain (of goats' skin) signified the waters which are above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>; the skins dyed red denoted the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are; the violet skins, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of the Blessed <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p>The figurative meaning of these things is that the boards of which the tabernacle was constructed signify the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who compose the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The boards were covered on the inner side by curtains of four colors: because the faithful are inwardly adorned with the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for "the twisted linen," as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes, "signifies the flesh refulgent with purity; violet signifies the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> desirous of heavenly things; purple denotes the flesh subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; the twice dyed scarlet betokens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> enlightened by the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor." The coverings of the building designate <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, who ought to be conspicuous for their heavenly manner of life, signified by the violet colored skins: and who should also be ready to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, denoted by the skins dyed red; and austere of life and patient in adversity, betokened by the curtains of goats' hair, which were exposed to wind and rain, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> The literal reason for the sanctification of the tabernacle and vessels was that they might be treated with greater reverence, being deputed, as it were, to the divine worship by this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The figurative reason is that this sanctification signified the sanctification of the living tabernacle, i.e. the faithful of whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is composed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> Under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there were seven temporal solemnities, and one continual <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/num028.htm">Numbers 28</a> and <a href="../bible/num029.htm">29</a>. There was a continual feast, since the lamb was sacrificed every day, morning and evening: and this continual feast of an abiding sacrifice signified the perpetuity of Divine bliss. Of the temporal feasts the first was that which was repeated every week. This was the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the "Sabbath," celebrated in memory of the work of the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, viz. the "New Moon," was repeated every month, and was observed in memory of the work of the Divine government. For the things of this lower world owe their variety chiefly to the movement of the moon; wherefore this feast was kept at the new moon: and not at the full moon, to avoid the worship of idolaters who used to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the moon at that particular time. And these two blessings are bestowed in common on the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and hence they were repeated more frequently.

<p>The other five feasts were celebrated once a year: and they commemorated the benefits which had been conferred especially on that people. For there was the feast of the "Passover" in the first month to commemorate the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of being delivered out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The feast of "Pentecost" was celebrated fifty days later, to recall the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the giving of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. The other three feasts were kept in the seventh month, nearly the whole of which was solemnized by them, just as the seventh day. For on the first of the seventh month was the feast of "Trumpets," in memory of the delivery of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> found the ram caught by its horns, which they represented by the horns which they blew. The feast of Trumpets was a kind of invitation whereby they prepared themselves to keep the following feast which was kept on the tenth day. This was the feast of "Expiation," in memory of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> whereby, at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forgave the people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of worshipping the calf. After this was the feast of "Scenopegia" or of "Tents," which was kept for seven days, to commemorate the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of being protected and led by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the desert, where they lived in tents. Hence during this feast they had to take "the fruits of the fairest tree," i.e. the citron, "and the trees of dense foliage" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a> and <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a> and R.V. read: 'Boughs of thick trees'], i.e. the myrtle, which is fragrant, "and the branches of palm-trees, and willows of the brook," which retain their greenness a long time; and these are to be found in the Land of promise; to signify that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had brought them through the arid land of the wilderness to a land of delights. On the eighth day another feast was observed, of "Assembly and Congregation," on which the people collected the expenses <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the divine worship: and it signified the uniting of the people and the peace granted to them in the Land of promise.

<p>The figurative reason for these feasts was that the continual sacrifice of the lamb foreshadowed the perpetuity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the "Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse8">Hebrews 13:8</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> yesterday and today, and the same for ever." The Sabbath signified the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rest bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/heb004.htm">Hebrews 4</a>. The Neomenia, which is the beginning of the new moon, signified the enlightening of the primitive Church by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> preaching and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The feast of Pentecost signified the Descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. The feast of Trumpets signified the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. The feast of Expiation signified the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and the feast of Tabernacles signified their pilgrimage in this world, wherein they walk by advancing in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The feast of Assembly or Congregation foreshadowed the assembly of the faithful in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: wherefore this feast is described as "most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>" (<a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse36">Leviticus 23:36</a>). These three feasts followed immediately on one another, because those who expiate their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> should advance in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, until they come to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse8">Psalm 83:8</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there can be any suitable cause for the sacraments of the Old Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there can be no suitable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Because those things that are done for the purpose of divine worship should not be like the observances of idolaters: since it is written (<a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse31">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>): "Thou shalt not do in like manner to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>: for they have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord abhorreth." Now worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> used to knive themselves to the shedding of blood: for it is related (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse28">1 Kings 18:28</a>) that they "cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till they were all covered with blood." For this reason the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/deu014.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>): "You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness for the dead." Therefore it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to be prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#verse3">Leviticus 12:3</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things which are done for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be marked with decorum and gravity; according to <a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse18">Psalm 34:18</a>: "I will praise Thee in a grave [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'strong'] people." But it seems to savor of levity for a man to eat with haste. Therefore it was unfittingly commanded (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse11">Exodus 12:11</a>) that they should eat the Paschal lamb "in haste." Other things too relative to the eating of the lamb were prescribed, which seem altogether unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were figures of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Now the Paschal lamb signified the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Pasch is sacrificed." Therefore there should also have been some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> to foreshadow the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, such as Confirmation, <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, and Matrimony, and so forth.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, purification can scarcely be done except by removing something impure. But as far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is concerned, no bodily thing is reputed impure, because all bodies are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures; and "every creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving" (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>). It was therefore unfitting for them to be purified after contact with a corpse, or any similar corporeal infection.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse4">Sirach 34:4</a>): "What can be made clean by the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>?" But the ashes of the red heifer [Cf. <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse13">Hebrews 9:13</a> which was burnt, were <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, since they made a man <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: for it is stated (<a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse7">Numbers 19:7, seqq.</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who immolated her was rendered <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> "until the evening"; likewise he that burnt her; and he that gathered up her ashes. Therefore it was unfittingly prescribed there that the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> should be purified by being sprinkled with those cinders.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not something corporeal that can be carried from one place to another: nor can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by means of something <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. It was therefore unfitting for the purpose of expiating the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should confess the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on one of the buck-goats, that it might carry them away into the wilderness: while they were rendered <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> by the other, which they used for the purpose of purification, by burning it together with the calf outside the camp; so that they had to wash their clothes and their bodies with water (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm">Leviticus 16</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, what is already cleansed should not be cleansed again. It was therefore unfitting to apply a second purification to a man cleansed from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, or to a house; as laid down in <a href="../bible/lev014.htm">Leviticus 14</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> cannot be cleansed by material water or by shaving the hair. Therefore it seems unreasonable that the Lord ordered (<a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse18">Exodus 30:18, seqq.</a>) the making of a brazen laver with its foot, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> might wash their hands and feet before entering the temple; and that He commanded (<a href="../bible/num008.htm#verse7">Numbers 8:7</a>) the Levites to be sprinkled with the water of purification, and to shave all the hairs of their flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, that which is greater cannot be cleansed by that which is less. Therefore it was unfitting that, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the higher and lower <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/lev008.htm">Leviticus 8</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/exo029.htm">Exodus 29</a>], and the Levites, according to <a href="../bible/num008.htm">Numbers 8</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with any bodily anointing, bodily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and bodily oblations.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, as stated in <a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, "Man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart." But those things that appear outwardly in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are the dispositions of his body and his clothes. Therefore it was unfitting for certain special garments to be appointed to the higher and lower <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as related in <a href="../bible/exo028.htm">Exodus 28</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/lev008.htm#verse7">Leviticus 8:7</a>, seqq.]. It seems, moreover, unreasonable that anyone should be debarred from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on account of defects in the body, as stated in <a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus 21:17</a>, seqq.: "Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . if he be blind, if he be lame," etc. It seems, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were unreasonable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev020.htm#verse8">Leviticus 20:8</a>): "I am the Lord that sanctify you." But nothing unreasonable is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse24">Psalm 103:24</a>): "Thou hast made all things in wisdom." Therefore there was nothing without a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which were ordained to the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 101, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are, properly speaking, things applied to the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> so as, in some way, to depute them to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belonged in a general way to the whole people; but in a special way, it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and Levites, who were the ministers of divine worship. Consequently, in these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, certain things concerned the whole people in general; while others belonged to the ministers.

<p>In regard to both, three things were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The first was to be established in the state of worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and this institution was brought about--for all in general, by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, without which no one was admitted to any of the legal observances--and for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The second thing required was the use of those things that pertain to divine worship. And thus, as to the people, there was the partaking of the paschal banquet, to which no uncircumcised <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was admitted, as is clear from <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse43">Exodus 12:43, seqq.</a>: and, as to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the offering of the victims, and the eating of the loaves of proposition and of other things that were allotted to the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The third thing required was the removal of all <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to divine worship, viz. of uncleannesses. And then, as to the people, certain purifications were instituted for the removal of certain external uncleannesses; and also expiations from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; while, as to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and Levites, the washing of hands and feet and the shaving of the hair were instituted.

<p>And all these things had reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, both literal, in so far as they were ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the time being, and figurative, in so far as they were ordained to foreshadow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: as we shall see by taking them one by one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The chief literal reason for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might profess his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was the first to sever himself from the infidels, by going out from his house and kindred, for this reason he was the first to receive <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. This reason is set forth by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse9">Romans 4:9, seqq.</a>) thus: "He received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, a seal of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he had, being uncircumcised"; because, to wit, we are told that "unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was reputed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," for the reason that "against hope he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in hope," i.e. against the hope that is of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the hope that is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, "that he might be made the father of many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>," when he was an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and his wife an old and barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And in order that this declaration, and imitation of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, might be fixed firmly in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, they received in their flesh such a sign as they could not forget, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse13">Genesis 17:13</a>): "My covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant." This was done on the eighth day, because until then a child is very tender, and so might be seriously injured; and is considered as something not yet consolidated: wherefore neither are animals offered before the eighth day. And it was not delayed after that time, lest some might refuse the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on account of the pain: and also lest the parents, whose love for their children increases as they become used to their presence and as they grow older, should withdraw their children from <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. A second reason may have been the weakening of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in that member. A third motive may have been to revile the worship of Venus and Priapus, which gave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to that part of the body. The Lord's prohibition extended only to the cutting of oneself in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: and such was not the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of which we have been speaking.

<p>The figurative reason for <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was that it foreshadowed the removal of corruption, which was to be brought about by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and will be perfectly fulfilled in the eighth age, which is the age of those who rise from the dead. And since all corruption of guilt and punishment comes to us through our carnal origin, from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, therefore <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was applied to the generative member. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11</a>): "You are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>" in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus</a> "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The literal reason of the paschal banquet was to commemorate the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of being led by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Hence by celebrating this banquet they declared that they belonged to that people which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had taken to Himself out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For when they were delivered from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, they were commanded to sprinkle the lamb's blood on the transoms of their house doors, as though declaring that they were averse to the rites of the Egyptians who worshipped the ram. Wherefore they were delivered by the sprinkling or rubbing of the blood of the lamb on the door-posts, from the danger of extermination which threatened the Egyptians.

<p>Now two things are to be observed in their departure from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: namely, their haste in going, for the Egyptians pressed them to go forth speedily, as related in <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse33">Exodus 12:33</a>; and there was danger that anyone who did not hasten to go with the crowd might be slain by the Egyptians. Their haste was shown in two ways. First by what they ate. For they were commanded to eat unleavened bread, as a sign "that it could not be leavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart"; and to eat roast meat, for this took less time to prepare; and that they should not break a bone thereof, because in their haste there was no time to break bones. Secondly, as to the manner of eating. For it is written: "You shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat in haste": which clearly designates men at the point of starting on a journey. To this also is to be referred the command: "In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house": because, to wit, on account of their haste, they could not send any <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of it.

<p>The stress they suffered while in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was denoted by the wild lettuces. The figurative reason is evident, because the sacrifice of the paschal lamb signified the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our pasch is sacrificed." The blood of the lamb, which ensured deliverance from the destroyer, by being sprinkled on the transoms, signified <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, in the hearts and on the lips of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, by which same <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> we are delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, according to <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse18">1 Peter 1:18</a>: "You were . . . redeemed . . . with the precious blood . . . of a lamb unspotted." The partaking of its flesh signified the eating of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the Sacrament; and the flesh was roasted at the fire to signify <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. And it was eaten with unleavened bread to signify the blameless life of the faithful who partake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, according to <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>: "Let us feast . . . with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." The wild lettuces were added to denote repentance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is required of those who receive the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Their loins were girt in sign of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: and the shoes of their feet are the examples of our dead ancestors. The staves they were to hold in their hands denoted pastoral authority: and it was commanded that the paschal lamb should be eaten in one house, i.e. in a catholic church, and not in the conventicles of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> had corresponding figurative <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which is the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, corresponds to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11-12</a>): "You are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> . . . in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus</a> "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: buried with Him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>." In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> corresponds to the banquet of the paschal lamb. The <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> corresponds to all the purifications of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacrament of Orders</a> corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the pontiff and of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of Confirmation</a>, which is the sacrament of the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there would be no corresponding sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, because the time of fulness had not yet come, since "the Law brought no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'nothing'] to perfection" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a>). The same applies to the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a>, which is an immediate preparation for entrance into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to which the way was not yet opened out in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, since the price had not yet been paid. Matrimony did indeed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as a function of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but not as the sacrament of the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for that union was not as yet brought about. Hence under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> it was allowable to give a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As already stated, the purifications of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were ordained for the removal of <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to the divine worship: which worship is twofold; viz. <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, consisting in devotion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and corporal, consisting in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, oblations, and so forth. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are hindered in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worship by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whereby men were said to be polluted, for instance, by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or incest. From such pollutions men were purified by certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, offered either for the whole community in general, or also for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; not that those carnal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> had of themselves the power of expiating <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that they signified that expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which was to be effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of which those of old became partakers by protesting their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Redeemer, while taking part in the figurative <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> to external worship consisted in certain bodily uncleannesses; which were considered in the first place as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and consequently in other animals also, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> clothes, dwelling-place, and vessels. In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was considered as arising partly from himself and partly from contact with <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> things. Anything proceeding from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was reputed <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> that was already subject to corruption, or exposed thereto: and consequently since death is a kind of corruption, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> corpse was considered <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. In like manner, since <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> arises from corruption of the humors, which break out externally and infect other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore were lepers also considered <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>; and, again, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> suffering from a flow of blood, whether from weakness, or from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (either at the monthly course or at the time of conception); and, for the same reason, men were reputed <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> if they suffered from a flow of seed, whether due to weakness, to nocturnal pollution, or to sexual intercourse. Because every humor issuing from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the aforesaid ways involves some <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> infection. Again, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contracted <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> by touching any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing whatever.

<p>Now there was both a literal and a figurative reason for these uncleannesses. The literal reason was taken from the reverence due to those things that belong to the divine worship: both because men are not wont, when <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, to touch precious things: and in order that by rarely approaching sacred things they might have greater respect for them. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could seldom avoid all the aforesaid uncleannesses, the result was that men could seldom approach to touch things belonging to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that when they did approach, they did so with greater reverence and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Moreover, in some of these the literal reason was that men should not be kept away from worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through fear of coming in contact with lepers and others similarly afflicted with loathsome and contagious diseases. In others, again, the reason was to avoid idolatrous worship: because in their sacrificial rites the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> sometimes employed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood and seed. All these bodily uncleannesses were purified either by the mere sprinkling of water, or, in the case of those which were more grievous, by some sacrifice of expiation for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in question.

<p>The figurative reason for these uncleannesses was that they were figures of various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of any corpse signifies the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> betokened the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrine: both because <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrine is contagious just as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is, and because no doctrine is so <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as not to have some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> mingled with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, just as on the surface of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> body one may distinguish the healthy parts from those that are infected. The <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> suffering from a flow of blood denotes the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, on account of the blood which is offered up. The <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has suffered seminal loss signifies the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of empty words, for "the seed is the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of sexual intercourse and of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in child-birth signifies the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in her periods signifies the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of a mind that is sensualized by pleasure. Speaking generally, the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> contracted by touching an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing denotes the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> arising from consent in another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>: "Go out from among them, and be ye separate . . . and touch not the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing."

<p>Moreover, this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> arising from the touch was contracted even by inanimate objects; for whatever was touched in any way by an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, became itself unclean. Wherein the Law attenuated the superstition of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who held that <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was contracted not only by touch, but also by speech or looks, as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> states (Doct. Perplex. iii) of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in her periods. The mystical sense of this was that "to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are hateful alike" (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse9">Wisdom 14:9</a>).

<p>There was also an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of inanimate things considered in themselves, such as the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in a house or in clothes. For just as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> occurs in men through a corrupt humor <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> putrefaction and corruption in the flesh; so, too, through some corruption and excess of humidity or dryness, there arises sometimes a kind of corruption in the stones with which a house is built, or in clothes. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> called this corruption by the name of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, whereby a house or a garment was deemed to be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: both because all corruption savored of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, as stated above, and because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> worshipped their household gods as a preservative against this corruption. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed such houses, where this kind of corruption was of a lasting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to be destroyed; and such garments to be burnt, in order to avoid all occasion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. There was also an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of vessels, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse15">Numbers 19:15</a>): "The vessel that hath no cover, and binding over it, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>." The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was that anything <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> might easily drop into such vessels, so as to render them <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. Moreover, this command aimed at the prevention of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For idolaters <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that if mice, lizards, or the like, which they used to sacrifice to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, fell into the vessels or into the water, these became more pleasing to the gods. Even now some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> let down uncovered vessels in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the nocturnal deities which they call "Janae."

<p>The figurative reason of these uncleannesses is that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of a house signified the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the assembly of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of a linen garment signified an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life arising from bitterness of mind; the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of a woolen garment denoted the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of flatterers; <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in the warp signified the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> on the woof denoted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, for as the warp is in the woof, so is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body. The vessel that has neither cover nor binding, betokens a man who lacks the veil of taciturnity, and who is unrestrained by any severity of discipline.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As stated above (ad 4), there was a twofold <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; one by way of corruption in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or in the body; and this was the graver <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>; the other was by mere contact with an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing, and this was less grave, and was more easily expiated. Because the former <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was expiated by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since all corruption is due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and signifies <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas the latter <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was expiated by the mere sprinkling of a certain water, of which water we read in <a href="../bible/num019.htm">Numbers 19</a>. For there <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded them to take a red cow in memory of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they had committed in worshipping a calf. And a cow is mentioned rather than a calf, because it was thus that the Lord was wont to designate the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, according to <a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse16">Hosea 4:16</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath gone astray like a wanton heifer": and this was, perhaps, because they worshipped heifers after the custom of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, according to <a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse5">Hosea 10:5</a>: "(They) have worshipped the kine of Bethaven." And in detestation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> it was sacrificed outside the camp; in fact, whenever sacrifice was offered up in expiation of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it was all burnt outside the camp. Moreover, in order to show that this sacrifice cleansed the people from all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>" dipped "his finger in her blood," and sprinkled "it over against the door of the tabernacle seven times"; for the number seven signified universality. Further, the very sprinkling of blood pertained to the detestation of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, in which the blood that was offered up was not poured out, but was collected together, and men gathered round it to eat in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the idols. Likewise it was burnt by fire, either because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in a fire, and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was given from the midst of fire; or to denote that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, together with all that was connected therewith, was to be extirpated altogether; just as the cow was burnt "with her skin and her flesh, her blood and dung being delivered to the flames." To this burning were added "cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet twice dyed," to signify that just as cedar-wood is not liable to putrefaction, and scarlet twice dyed does not easily lose its color, and hyssop retains its odor after it has been dried; so also was this sacrifice for the preservation of the whole people, and for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> behavior and devotion. Hence it is said of the ashes of the cow: "That they may be reserved for the multitude of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Or, according to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq. iii, 8,9,10), the four elements are indicated here: for "cedar-wood" was added to the fire, to signify the earth, on account of its earthiness; "hyssop," to signify the air, on account of its smell; "scarlet twice dyed," to signify water, for the same reason as purple, on account of the dyes which are taken out of the water: thus denoting the fact that this sacrifice was offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of the four elements. And since this sacrifice was offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, both "he that burned her," and "he that gathered up the ashes," and "he that sprinkled the water" in which the ashes were placed, were deemed <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> in detestation of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order to show that whatever was in any way connected with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> should be cast aside as being unclean. From this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> they were purified by the mere washing of their clothes; nor did they need to be sprinkled with the water on account of this kind of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, because otherwise the process would have been unending, since he that sprinkled the water became <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, so that if he were to sprinkle himself he would remain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>; and if another were to sprinkle him, that one would have become <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, and in like manner, whoever might sprinkle him, and so on indefinitely.

<p>The figurative reason of this sacrifice was that the red cow signified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in respect his assumed weakness, denoted by the female sex; while the color of the cow designated the blood of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. And the "red cow was of full age," because all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> works are perfect, "in which there" was "no blemish"; "and which" had "not carried the yoke," because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was innocent, nor did He carry the yoke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It was commanded to be taken to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, because they blamed Him for transgressing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by breaking the Sabbath. And it was commanded to be delivered "to Eleazar the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>," because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was delivered into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be slain. It was immolated "without the camp," because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "suffered outside the gate" (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>). And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dipped "his finger in her blood," because the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> should be considered and imitated.

<p>It was sprinkled "over against . . . the tabernacle," which denotes the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, to signify either the condemnation of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, or the purification of believers; and this "seven times," in token either of the seven <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or of the seven days wherein all time is comprised. Again, all things that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be burnt with fire, i.e. they should be understood spiritually; for the "skin" and "flesh" signified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> outward works; the "blood" denoted the subtle inward force which quickened His external <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; the "dung" betokened His weariness, His thirst, and all such like things pertaining to His weakness. Three things were added, viz. "cedar-wood," which denotes the height of hope or <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; "hyssop," in token of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; "scarlet twice dyed," which denotes twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; for it is by these three that we should cling to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffering. The ashes of this burning were gathered by "a man that is clean," because the relics of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who were not guilty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death. The ashes were put into water for the purpose of expiation, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> receives from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> the power of washing away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who immolated and burned the cow, and he who burned, and he who gathered together the ashes, were <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, as also he that sprinkled the water: either because the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> became <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> through putting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to death, whereby our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are expiated; and this, until the evening, i.e. until the end of the world, when the remnants of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>; or else because they who handle sacred things with a view to the cleansing of others contract certain uncleannesses, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 5); and this until the evening, i.e. until the end of this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As stated above (ad 5), an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> which was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by corruption either of mind or of body was expiated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>-offerings. Now special <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were wont to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: but since some were neglectful about expiating such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and uncleannesses; or, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, failed to offer this expiation; it was laid down that once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month, a sacrifice of expiation should be offered for the whole people. And because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse28">Hebrews 7:28</a>), "the Law maketh men <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who have infirmity," it behooved the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> first of all to offer a calf for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in memory of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in fashioning the molten calf; and besides, to offer a ram for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, which signified that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> sovereignty denoted by the ram, who is the head of the flock, was to be ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then he offered two he-goats for the people: one of which was offered in expiation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the multitude. For the he-goat is an evil-smelling animal; and from its skin clothes are made having a pungent odor; to signify the stench, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and the sting of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. After this he-goat had been immolated, its blood was taken, together with the blood of the calf, into the Holy of Holies, and the entire sanctuary was sprinkled with it; to signify that the tabernacle was cleansed from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But the corpses of the he-goat and calf which had been offered up for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had to be burnt, to denote the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They were not, however, burnt on the altar: since none but holocausts were burnt thereon; but it was prescribed that they should be burnt without the camp, in detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for this was done whenever sacrifice was offered for a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or for the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The other goat was let loose into the wilderness: not indeed to offer it to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> worshipped in desert places, because it was unlawful to offer aught to them; but in order to point out the effect of the sacrifice which had been offered up. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> put his hand on its head, while confessing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: as though that goat were to carry them away into the wilderness, where it would be devoured by wild beasts, because it bore the punishment of the people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And it was said to bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people, either because the forgiveness of the people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was signified by its being let loose, or because on its head written lists of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were fastened.

<p>The figurative reason of these things was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was foreshadowed both by the calf, on account of His power; and by the ram, because He is the Head of the faithful; and by the he-goat, on account of "the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>). Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was sacrificed for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people: since both those of high and those of low degree are cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. The blood of the calf and of the goat was brought into the Holies by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because the entrance to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> was opened to us by the blood of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. Their bodies were burnt without the camp, because "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered without the gate," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>). The scape-goat may denote either <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead Which went away into solitude when the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered, not by going to another place, but by restraining His power: or it may signify the base <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which we ought to cast away from ourselves, while we offer up to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> contracted by those who burnt these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, the reason is the same as that which we assigned (ad 5) to the sacrifice of the red heifer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The legal rite did not cleanse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> of his deformity, but declared him to be cleansed. This is shown by the words of <a href="../bible/lev014.htm#verse3">Leviticus 14:3</a>, seqq., where it was said that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, "when he shall find that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is cleansed," shall command "him that is to be purified": consequently, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was already healed: but he was said to be purified in so far as the verdict of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> restored him to the society of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It happened sometimes, however, that bodily <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured by the legal rite, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in his judgment.

<p>Now this purification of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was twofold: for, in the first place, he was declared to be clean; and, secondly, he was restored, as clean, to the society of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to wit, after seven days. At the first purification the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> who sought to be cleansed offered for himself "two living sparrows . . . cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop," in such wise that a sparrow and the hyssop should be tied to the cedar-wood with a scarlet thread, so that the cedar-wood was like the handle of an aspersory: while the hyssop and sparrow were that part of the aspersory which was dipped into the blood of the other sparrow which was "immolated . . . over living waters." These things he offered as an antidote to the four defects of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>: for cedar-wood, which is not subject to putrefaction, was offered against the putrefaction; hyssop, which is a sweet-smelling herb, was offered up against the stench; a living sparrow was offered up against numbness; and scarlet, which has a vivid color, was offered up against the repulsive color of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. The living sparrow was let loose to fly away into the plain, because the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was restored to his former liberty.

<p>On the eighth day he was admitted to divine worship, and was restored to the society of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; but only after having shaved all the hair of his body, and washed his clothes, because <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> rots the hair, infects the clothes, and gives them an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> smell. Afterwards a sacrifice was offered for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> was frequently a result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and some of the blood of the sacrifice was put on the tip of the ear of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was to be cleansed, "and on the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot"; because it is in these parts that <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is first diagnosed and felt. In this rite, moreover, three liquids were employed: viz. blood, against the corruption of the blood; oil, to denote the healing of the disease; and living waters, to wash away the filth.

<p>The figurative reason was that the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were denoted by the two sparrows, one of which, in likeness of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, was offered up in an earthen vessel over living waters, because the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. The other sparrow, in token of His impassible Godhead, remained living, because the Godhead cannot die: hence it flew away, for the Godhead could not be encompassed by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Now this living sparrow, together with the cedar-wood and scarlet or cochineal, and hyssop, i.e. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (ad 5), was put into the water for the purpose of sprinkling, because we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-Man. By the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> or of his tears <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> washes his clothes, i.e. his works, and all his hair, i.e. his thoughts. The tip of the right ear of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be cleansed is moistened with some the blood and oil, in order to strengthen his hearing against harmful words; and the thumb and toe of his right hand and foot are moistened that his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> may be holy. Other matters pertaining to this purification, or to that also of any other uncleannesses, call for no special remark, beyond what applies to other <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, whether for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or for trespasses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objections 8 and 9.</strong> Just as the people were initiated by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to the divine worship, so were the ministers by some special purification or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>: wherefore they are commanded to be separated from other men, as being specially deputed, rather than others, to the ministry of the divine worship. And all that was done touching them in their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or institution, was with a view to show that they were in possession of a prerogative of purity, power and dignity. Hence three things were done in the institution of ministers: for first, they were purified; secondly, they were adorned ['Ornabantur.' Some editions have 'ordinabantur'--'were ordained': the former reading is a reference to <a href="../bible/lev008.htm#verse7">Leviticus 8:7-9</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; thirdly, they were employed in the ministry. All in general used to be purified by washing in water, and by certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; but the Levites in particular shaved all the hair of their bodies, as stated in <a href="../bible/lev008.htm">Leviticus 8</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/num008.htm">Numbers 8</a>).

<p>With regard to the high-priests and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was performed as follows. First, when they had been washed, they were clothed with certain special garments in designation of their dignity. In particular, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> was anointed on the head with the oil of unction: to denote that the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was poured forth by him on to others, just as oil flows from the head on to the lower parts of the body; according to <a href="../bible/psa132.htm#verse2">Psalm 132:2</a>: "Like the precious ointment on the head that ran down upon the beard, the beard of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>." But the Levites received no other <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> besides being offered to the Lord by the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> through the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them. The lesser <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the hands only, which were to be employed in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. The tip of their right ear and the thumb of their right hand, and the great toe of their right foot were tinged with the blood of the sacrificial animal, to denote that they should be obedient to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> in offering the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> (this is denoted by touching their right ear); and that they should be careful and ready in performing the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> (this is signified by the moistening of the right foot and hand). They themselves and their garments were sprinkled with the blood of the animal that had been sacrificed, in memory of the blood of the lamb by which they had been delivered in Egypt. At their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the following <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered: a calf, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in memory of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in fashioning the molten calf; a ram, for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, in memory of the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whose obedience it behooved the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> to imitate; again, a ram of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which was a peace-offering, in memory of the delivery form <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through the blood of the lamb; and a basket of bread, in memory of the manna vouchsafed to the people.

<p>In reference to their being destined to the ministry, the fat of the ram, one roll of bread, and the right shoulder were placed on their hands, to show that they received the power of offering these things to the Lord: while the Levites were initiated to the ministry by being brought into the tabernacle of the covenant, as being destined to the ministry touching the vessels of the sanctuary.

<p>The figurative reason of these things was that those who are to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, should be first of all purified by the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, and by the waters of tears, in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which is a sacrifice both of expiation and of purification. They have also to shave all the hair of their body, i.e. all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts. They should, moreover, be decked with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the oil of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and with the sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood. And thus they should be intent on the fulfilment of their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> ministry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> As already stated (4), the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was to induce men to have reverence for the divine worship: and this in two ways; first, by excluding from the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whatever might be an object of contempt; secondly, by introducing into the divine worship all that seemed to savor of reverence. And, indeed, if this was observed in regard to the tabernacle and its vessels, and in the animals to be sacrificed, much more was it to be observed in the very ministers. Wherefore, in order to obviate contempt for the ministers, it was prescribed that they should have no bodily stain or defect: since men so deformed are wont to be despised by others. For the same reason it was also commanded that the choice of those who were to be destined to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not to be made in a broadcast manner from any <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but according to their descent from one particular stock, thus giving them distinction and nobility.

<p>In order that they might be revered, special ornate <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> were appointed for their use, and a special form of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. This indeed is the general reason of ornate garments. But the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> in particular had eight <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>. <ul><li>First, he had a linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>. <li>Secondly, he had a purple <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>; round the bottom of which were placed "little bells" and "pomegranates of violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed." <li>Thirdly, he had the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, which covered his shoulders and his breast down to the girdle; and it was made of gold, and violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed and twisted linen: and on his shoulders he bore two onyx stones, on which were graven the names of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <li>Fourthly, he had the rational, made of the same material; it was square in shape, and was worn on the breast, and was fastened to the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>. On this rational there were twelve precious stones set in four rows, on which also were graven the names of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in token that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> bore the burden of the whole people, since he bore their names on his shoulders; and that it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> ever to think of their welfare, since he wore them on his breast, bearing them in his heart, so to speak. And the Lord commanded the "Doctrine and Truth" to be put in the rational: for certain matters regarding moral and dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were written on it. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> indeed pretend that on the rational was placed a stone which changed color according to the various things which were about to happen to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and this they call the "Truth and Doctrine." <li>Fifthly, he wore a belt or girdle made of the four colors mentioned above. <li>Sixthly, there was the tiara or <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> which was made of linen. <li>Seventhly, there was the golden plate which hung over his forehead; on it was inscribed the Lord's name. <li>Eighthly, there were "the linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness," when they went up to the sanctuary or altar. Of these eight <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> the lesser <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had four, viz. the linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> and breeches, the belt and the tiara. </ul>

<p>According to some, the literal reason for these <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> was that they denoted the disposition of the terrestrial globe; as though the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> confessed himself to be the minister of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of the world, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis018.htm#verse24">Wisdom 18:24</a>): "In the robe" of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> "was the whole world" described. For the linen breeches signified the earth out of which the flax grows. The surrounding belt signified the ocean which surrounds the earth. The violet <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> denoted the air by its color: its little bells betoken the thunder; the pomegranates, the lightning. The <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, by its many colors, signified the starry <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; the two onyx stones denoted the two hemispheres, or the sun and moon. The twelve precious stones on the breast are the twelve signs of the zodiac: and they are said to have been placed on the rational because in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, are the types [rationes] of earthly things, according to <a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse33">Job 38:33</a>: "Dost thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the order of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and canst thou set down the reason [rationem] thereof on the earth?" The turban or tiara signified the empyrean: the golden plate was a token of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the governor of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p>The figurative reason is evident. Because bodily stains or defects wherefrom the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had to be immune, signify the various <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which they should be free. Thus it is forbidden that he should be blind, i.e. he ought not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>: he must not be lame, i.e. vacillating and uncertain of purpose: that he must have "a little, or a great, or a crooked nose," i.e. that he should not, from lack of discretion, exceed in one direction or in another, or even exercise some base occupation: for the nose signifies discretion, because it discerns odors. It is forbidden that he should have "a broken foot" or "hand," i.e. he should not lose the power of doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works or of advancing in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. He is rejected, too, if he have a swelling either in front or behind [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'if he be crook-backed']: by which is signified too much love of earthly things: if he be blear-eyed, i.e. if his mind is darkened by carnal affections: for running of the eyes is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a flow of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. He is also rejected if he had "a pearl in his eye," i.e. if he presumes in his own estimation that he is clothed in the white robe of righteousness. Again, he is rejected "if he have a continued scab," i.e. lustfulness of the flesh: also, if he have "a dry scurf," which covers the body without giving pain, and is a blemish on the comeliness of the members; which denotes avarice. Lastly, he is rejected "if he have a rupture" or hernia; through baseness rending his heart, though it appear not in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> denote the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers. Now there are four things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to all His ministers, viz. <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> denoted by the breeches; a pure life, signified by the linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>; the moderation of discretion, betokened by the girdle; and rectitude of purpose, denoted by the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> covering the head. But the high-priests needed four other things in addition to these. First, a continual recollection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their thoughts; and this was signified by the golden plate worn over the forehead, with the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> engraved thereon. Secondly, they had to bear with the shortcomings of the people: this was denoted by the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> which they bore on their shoulders. Thirdly, they had to carry the people in their mind and heart by the solicitude of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in token of which they wore the rational. Fourthly, they had to lead a godly life by performing works of perfection; and this was signified by the violet <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>. Hence little golden bells were fixed to the bottom of the violet <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, which bells signified the teaching of divine things united in the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> to his godly mode of life. In addition to these were the pomegranates, signifying unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and concord in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> morals: because his doctrine should hold together in such a way that it should not rend asunder the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and peace.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there was any reasonable cause for the ceremonial observances?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the ceremonial observances. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>), "every creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving." It was therefore unfitting that they should be forbidden to eat certain foods, as being <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> according to <a href="../bible/lev011.htm">Leviticus 11</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/deu014.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a>].

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as animals are given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for food, so also are herbs: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis 9:3</a>): "As the green herbs have I delivered all" flesh "to you." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not distinguish any herbs from the rest as being <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, although some are most harmful, for instance, those that are poisonous. Therefore it seems that neither should any animals have been prohibited as being <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which a thing is generated be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, it seems that likewise the thing generated therefrom is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. But flesh is generated from blood. Since therefore all flesh was not prohibited as <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, it seems that in like manner neither should blood have been forbidden as <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>; nor the fat which is engendered from blood.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke 12:4</a>), that those should not be feared "that kill the body," since after death they "have no more that they can do": which would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if after death harm might come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through anything done with his body. Much less therefore does it matter to an animal already dead how its flesh be cooked. Consequently there seems to be no reason in what is said, <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse19">Exodus 23:19</a>: "Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of its dam."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all that is first brought forth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast, as being most perfect, is commanded to be offered to the Lord (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm">Exodus 13</a>). Therefore it is an unfitting command that is set forth in <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse23">Leviticus 19:23</a>: "when you shall be come into the land, and shall have planted in it fruit trees, you shall take away the uncircumcision ['Praeputia,' which <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> renders <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">'first fruits'</a>] of them," i.e. the first crops, and they "shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> to you, neither shall you eat of them."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, clothing is something extraneous to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body. Therefore certain kinds of garments should not have been forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: for instance (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse19">Leviticus 19:19</a>): "Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of two sorts": and (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be clothed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> apparel, neither shall a man use <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> apparel": and further on (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 22:11</a>): "Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woolen and linen together."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, to be mindful of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments concerns not the body but the heart. Therefore it is unsuitably prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 6:8, seqq.</a>) that they should "bind" the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "as a sign" on their hands; and that they should "write them in the entry"; and (<a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse38">Numbers 15:38, seqq.</a>) that they should "make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue . . . they may remember . . . the commandments of the Lord."

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not "take care for oxen," and, therefore, neither of other irrational animals. Therefore without reason is it commanded (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>): "If thou find, as thou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree . . . thou shalt not take the dam with her young"; and (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out thy corn"; and (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse19">Leviticus 19:19</a>): "Thou shalt not make thy cattle to gender with beasts of any other kind."

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, no distinction was made between clean and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> plants. Much less therefore should any distinction have been made about the cultivation of plants. Therefore it was unfittingly prescribed (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse19">Leviticus 19:19</a>): "Thou shalt not sow thy field with different seeds"; and (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 22:9, seqq.</a>): "Thou shalt sow thy vineyard with divers seeds"; and: "Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together."

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, it is apparent that inanimate things are most of all subject to the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it was unfitting to debar <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from taking silver and gold of which <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were made, or anything they found in the houses of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, as expressed in the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy 7:25, seqq.</a>). It also seems an absurd commandment set forth in <a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 23:13</a>, that they should "dig round about and . . . cover with earth that which they were eased of."

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, piety is required especially in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But it seems to be an act of piety to assist at the burial of one's friends: wherefore <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> is commended for so doing (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#verse20">Tobit 1:20, seqq.</a>). In like manner it is sometimes an act of piety to marry a loose <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, because she is thereby delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. Therefore it seems inconsistent for these things to be forbidden to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm">Leviticus 21</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 18:14</a>): "But thou art otherwise instructed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>": from which words we may gather that these observances were instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be a special prerogative of that people. Therefore they are not without reason or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Jewish people, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), were specially chosen for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and among them the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> themselves were specially set apart for that purpose. And just as other things that are applied to the divine worship, need to be marked in some particular way so that they be worthy of the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so too in that people's, and especially the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>', mode of life, there needed to be certain special things befitting the divine worship, whether <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or corporal. Now the worship prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> foreshadowed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: so that whatever they did was a figure of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>: "All these things happened to them in figures." Consequently the reasons for these observances may be taken in two ways, first according to their fittingness to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; secondly, according as they foreshadow something touching the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mode of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (5, ad 4,5), the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> distinguished a twofold pollution or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>; one, that of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was defiled; and another consisting in some kind of corruption, whereby the body was in some way infected. Speaking then of the first-mentioned <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, no kind of food is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, or can defile a man, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; wherefore we read (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>): "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man": which words are explained (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:17</a>) as referring to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Yet certain foods can defile the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> partakes of them against obedience or a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, or from excessive <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; or through their being an incentive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for which reason some refrain from wine and flesh-meat.

<p>If, however, we speak of bodily <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, consisting in some kind of corruption, the flesh of certain animals is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, either because like the pig they feed on <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> things; or because their life is among <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> surroundings: thus certain animals, like moles and mice and such like, live underground, whence they contract a certain unpleasant smell; or because their flesh, through being too moist or too dry, engenders corrupt humors in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. Hence they were forbidden to eat the flesh of flat-footed animals, i.e. animals having an uncloven hoof, on account of their earthiness; and in like manner they were forbidden to eat the flesh of animals that have many clefts in their feet, because such are very fierce and their flesh is very dry, such as the flesh of lions and the like. For the same reason they were forbidden to eat certain birds of prey the flesh of which is very dry, and certain water-fowl on account of their exceeding humidity. In like manner certain fish lacking fins and scales were prohibited on account of their excessive moisture; such as eels and the like. They were, however, allowed to eat ruminants and animals with a divided hoof, because in such animals the humors are well absorbed, and their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> well balanced: for neither are they too moist, as is indicated by the hoof; nor are they too earthly, which is shown by their having not a flat but a cloven hoof. Of fishes they were allowed to partake of the drier kinds, of which the fins and scales are an indication, because thereby the moist <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fish is tempered. Of birds they were allowed to eat the tamer kinds, such as hens, partridges, and the like. Another reason was detestation of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and especially the Egyptians, among whom they had grown up, offered up these forbidden animals to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or employed them for the purpose of sorcery: whereas they did not eat those animals which the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were allowed to eat, but worshipped them as gods, or abstained, for some other motive, from eating them, as stated above (3, ad 2). The third reason was to prevent excessive care about food: wherefore they were allowed to eat those animals which could be procured easily and promptly.

<p>With regard to blood and fat, they were forbidden to partake of those of any animals whatever without exception. Blood was forbidden, both in order to avoid cruelty, that they might abhor the shedding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood, as stated above (3, ad 8); and in order to shun idolatrous rite whereby it was customary for men to collect the blood and to gather together around it for a banquet in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to whom they held the blood to be most acceptable. Hence the Lord commanded the blood to be poured out and to be covered with earth (<a href="../bible/lev017.htm#verse13">Leviticus 17:13</a>). For the same reason they were forbidden to eat animals that had been suffocated or strangled: because the blood of these animals would not be separated from the body: or because this form of death is very painful to the victim; and the Lord wished to withdraw them from cruelty even in regard to irrational animals, so as to be less inclined to be cruel to other men, through being used to be kind to beasts. They were forbidden to eat the fat: both because idolaters ate it in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of their gods; and because it used to be burnt in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, again, because blood and fat are not nutritious, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> assigned by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> (Doct. Perplex. iii). The reason why they were forbidden to eat the sinews is given in <a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse32">Genesis 32:32</a>, where it is stated that "the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> . . . eat not the sinew . . . because he touched the sinew of" <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> "thing and it shrank."

<p>The figurative reason for these things is that all these animals signified certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in token of which those animals were prohibited. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faustum iv, 7): "If the swine and lamb be called in question, both are clean by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: yet the lamb is clean, and the pig is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> in a certain signification. Thus if you speak of a foolish, and of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, each of these expressions is clean considered in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the sound, letters and syllables of which it is composed: but in signification, the one is clean, the other <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>." The animal that chews the cud and has a divided hoof, is clean in signification. Because division of the hoof is a figure of the two Testaments: or of the Father and Son: or of the two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: of the distinction of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. While chewing the cud signifies meditation on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and a sound understanding thereof; and whoever lacks either of these is spiritually <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. In like manner those fish that have scales and fins are clean in signification. Because fins signify the heavenly or contemplative life; while scales signify a life of trials, each of which is required for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> cleanness. Of birds certain kinds were forbidden. In the eagle which flies at a great height, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is forbidden: in the griffon which is hostile to horses and men, cruelty of powerful men is prohibited. The osprey, which feeds on very small birds, signifies those who oppress the poor. The kite, which is full of cunning, denotes those who are fraudulent in their dealings. The vulture, which follows an army, expecting to feed on the carcases of the slain, signifies those who like others to die or to fight among themselves that they may gain thereby. Birds of the raven kind signify those who are blackened by their lusts; or those who lack kindly feelings, for the raven did not return when once it had been let loose from the ark. The ostrich which, though a bird, cannot fly, and is always on the ground, signifies those who fight <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and at the same time are taken up with worldly business. The owl, which sees clearly at night, but cannot see in the daytime, denotes those who are clever in temporal affairs, but dull in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> matters. The gull, which flies both in the air and swims in the water, signifies those who are partial both to Circumcision and to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: or else it denotes those who would fly by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, yet dwell in the waters of sensual delights. The hawk, which helps men to seize the prey, is a figure of those who assist the strong to prey on the poor. The screech-owl, which seeks its food by night but hides by day, signifies the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who seeks to lie hidden in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of darkness. The cormorant, so constituted that it can stay a long time under water, denotes the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> who plunges into the waters of pleasure. The ibis is an African bird with a long beak, and feeds on snakes; and perhaps it is the same as the stork: it signifies the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who refreshes himself with the ills of others, as with snakes. The swan is bright in color, and by the aid of its long neck extracts its food from deep places on land or water: it may denote those who seek earthly profit though an external brightness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The bittern is a bird of the East: it has a long beak, and its jaws are furnished with follicules, wherein it stores its food at first, after a time proceeding to digest it: it is a figure of the miser, who is excessively careful in hoarding up the necessaries of life. The coot [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'porphyrion.' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' description tallies with the coot or moorhen: though of course he is mistaken about the feet differing from one another.] has this peculiarity apart from other birds, that it has a webbed foot for swimming, and a cloven foot for walking: for it swims like a duck in the water, and walks like a partridge on land: it drinks only when it bites, since it dips all its food in water: it is a figure of a man who will not take advice, and does nothing but what is soaked in the water of his own will. The heron [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'herodionem'], commonly called a falcon, signifies those whose "feet are swift to shed blood" (<a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse3">Psalm 13:3</a>). The plover [Here, again, the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a> translators transcribed from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'charadrion'; 'charadrius' is the generic name for all plovers.], which is a garrulous bird, signifies the gossip. The hoopoe, which builds its nest on dung, feeds on foetid ordure, and whose song is like a groan, denotes worldly grief which works death in those who are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. The bat, which flies near the ground, signifies those who being gifted with worldly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, seek none but earthly things. Of fowls and quadrupeds those alone were permitted which have the hind-legs longer than the forelegs, so that they can leap: whereas those were forbidden which cling rather to the earth: because those who abuse the doctrine of the four Evangelists, so that they are not lifted up thereby, are reputed unclean. By the prohibition of blood, fat and nerves, we are to understand the forbidding of cruelty, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and bravery in committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Men were wont to eat plants and other products of the soil even before the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>: but the eating of flesh seems to have been introduced after the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis 9:3</a>): "Even as the green herbs have I delivered . . . all" flesh "to you." The reason for this was that the eating of the products of the soil savors rather of a simple life; whereas the eating of flesh savors of delicate and over-careful living. For the soil gives birth to the herb of its own accord; and such like products of the earth may be had in great quantities with very little effort: whereas no small trouble is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either to rear or to catch an animal. Consequently <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being wishful to bring His people back to a more simple way of living, forbade them to eat many kinds of animals, but not those things that are produced by the soil. Another reason may be that animals were offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, while the products of the soil were not.

<p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said (ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the kid that is slain has no perception of the manner in which its flesh is cooked, yet it would seem to savor of heartlessness if the dam's milk, which was intended for the nourishment of her offspring, were served up on the same dish. It might also be said that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in celebrating the feasts of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> prepared the flesh of kids in this manner, for the purpose of sacrifice or banquet: hence (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm">Exodus 23</a>) after the solemnities to be celebrated under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had been foretold, it is added: "Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of its dam." The figurative reason for this prohibition is this: the kid, signifying <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of "the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>), was not to be seethed, i.e. slain, by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, "in the milk of its dam," i.e. during His infancy. Or else it signifies that the kid, i.e. the sinner, should not be boiled in the milk of its dam, i.e. should not be cajoled by flattery.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> offered their gods the first-fruits, which they held to bring them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> luck: or they burnt them for the purpose of secrecy. Consequently (the Israelites) were commanded to look upon the fruits of the first three years as <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: for in that country nearly all the trees bear fruit in three years' time; those trees, to wit, that are cultivated either from seed, or from a graft, or from a cutting: but it seldom happens that the fruit-stones or seeds encased in a pod are sown: since it would take a longer time for these to bear fruit: and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> considered what happened most frequently. The fruits, however, of the fourth year, as being the firstlings of clean fruits, were offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and from the fifth year onward they were eaten.

<p>The figurative reason was that this foreshadowed the fact that after the three states of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (the first lasting from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David, the second, until they were carried away to Babylon, the third until the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>), the Fruit of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was to be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or again, that we must mistrust our first efforts, on account of their imperfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> It is said of a man in <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse27">Sirach 19:27</a>, that "the attire of the body . . . " shows "what he is." Hence the Lord wished His people to be distinguished from other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, not only by the sign of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was in the flesh, but also by a certain difference of attire. Wherefore they were forbidden to wear garments woven of woolen and linen together, and for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be clothed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> apparel, or vice versa, for two reasons. First, to avoid idolatrous worship. Because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in their religious rites, used garments of this sort, made of various materials. Moreover in the worship of Mars, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> put on men's armor; while, conversely, in the worship of Venus men donned <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> attire. The second reason was to preserve them from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: because the employment of various materials in the making of garments signified inordinate union of sexes, while the use of male attire by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or vice versa, has an incentive to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, and offers an occasion of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. The figurative reason is that the prohibition of wearing a garment woven of woolen and linen signified that it was forbidden to unite the simplicity of innocence, denoted by wool, with the duplicity of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, betokened by linen. It also signifies that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is forbidden to presume to teach, or perform other duties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not adopt the effeminate manners of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse6">Matthew 23:6</a>, "the Lord commanded them to make violet-colored fringes in the four corners of their garments, so that the Israelites might be distinguished from other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Hence, in this way, they professed to be <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: and consequently the very sight of this sign reminded them of their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>When we read: "Thou shalt bind them on thy hand, and they shall be ever before thy eyes [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'they shall be and shall move between thy eyes'], the Pharisees gave a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation to these words, and wrote the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on a parchment, and tied it on their foreheads like a wreath, so that it moved in front of their eyes": whereas the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the Lord in giving this commandment was that they should be bound in their hands, i.e. in their works; and that they should be before their eyes, i.e. in their thoughts. The violet-colored fillets which were inserted in their cloaks signify the godly <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> which should accompany our every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. It may, however, be said that, because they were a carnal-minded and stiff-necked people, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to be stirred by these sensible things to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Affection in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is twofold: it may be an affection of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, or it may be an affection of passion. If a man's affection be one of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it matters not how <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves to animals, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has subjected all things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, according to <a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse8">Psalm 8:8</a>: "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet": and it is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no care for oxen"; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not ask of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what he does with oxen or other animals.

<p>But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affection be one of passion, then it is moved also in regard to other animals: for since the passion of pity is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the afflictions of others; and since it happens that even irrational animals are sensible to pain, it is possible for the affection of pity to arise in a man with regard to the sufferings of animals. Now it is evident that if a man practice a pitiful affection for animals, he is all the more disposed to take pity on his fellow-men: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse10">Proverbs 11:10</a>): "The just regardeth the lives of his beasts: but the bowels of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are cruel." Consequently the Lord, in order to inculcate pity to the Jewish people, who were prone to cruelty, wished them to practice pity even with regard to dumb animals, and forbade them to do certain things savoring of cruelty to animals. Hence He prohibited them to "boil a kid in the milk of its dam"; and to "muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn"; and to slay "the dam with her young." It may, nevertheless, be also said that these prohibitions were made in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For the Egyptians held it to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to allow the ox to eat of the grain while threshing the corn. Moreover certain sorcerers were wont to ensnare the mother bird with her young during incubation, and to employ them for the purpose of securing fruitfulness and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> luck in bringing up children: also because it was held to be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> omen to find the mother sitting on her young.

<p>As to the mingling of animals of divers <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the literal reason may have been threefold. The first was to show detestation for the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of the Egyptians, who employed various mixtures in worshipping the planets, which produce various effects, and on various kinds of things according to their various conjunctions. The second reason was in condemnation of unnatural <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The third reason was the entire removal of all occasions of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Because animals of different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> do not easily breed, unless this be brought about by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and movements of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are aroused by seeing such things. Wherefore in the Jewish traditions we find it prescribed as stated by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> that men shall turn away their eyes from such sights.

<p>The figurative reason for these things is that the necessities of life should not be withdrawn from the ox that treadeth the corn, i.e. from the preacher bearing the sheaves of doctrine, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 9:4, seqq.</a>). Again, we should not take the dam with her young: because in certain things we have to keep the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> senses, i.e. the offspring, and set aside the observance of the letter, i.e. the mother, for instance, in all the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. It is also forbidden that beast of burden, i.e. any of the common people, should be allowed to engender, i.e. to have any connection, with animals of another kind, i.e. with <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> All these minglings were forbidden in agriculture; literally, in detestation of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For the Egyptians in worshipping the stars employed various combinations of seeds, animals and garments, in order to represent the various connections of the stars. Or else all these minglings were forbidden in detestation of the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p>They have, however, a figurative reason. For the prohibition: "Thou shalt not sow thy field with different seeds," is to be understood, in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sense, of the prohibition to sow strange doctrine in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> vineyard. Likewise "the field," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must not be sown "with different seeds," i.e. with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines. Neither is it allowed to plough "with an ox and an ass together"; thus a fool should not accompany a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in preaching, for one would hinder the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> [The Reply to the Tenth Objection is lacking in the codices. The solution given here is found in some editions, and was supplied by Nicolai.] Silver and gold were reasonably forbidden (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm">Deuteronomy 7</a>) not as though they were not subject to the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but because, like the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> themselves, all materials out of which <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were made, were anathematized as hateful in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight. This is clear from the same chapter, where we read further on (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>): "Neither shalt thou bring anything of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> into thy house, lest thou become an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> like it." Another reason was lest, by taking silver and gold, they should be led by avarice into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were inclined. The other precept (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm">Deuteronomy 23</a>) about covering up excretions, was just and becoming, both for the sake of bodily cleanliness; and in order to keep the air wholesome; and by reason of the respect due to the tabernacle of the covenant which stood in the midst of the camp, wherein the Lord was said to dwell; as is clearly set forth in the same passage, where after expressing the command, the reason thereof is at once added, to wit: "For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thy enemies to thee, and let thy camp be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> [i.e. clean], and let no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> appear therein." The figurative reason for this precept, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi), is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are the fetid excretions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> should be covered over by repentance, that we may become acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse1">Psalm 31:1</a>: "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered." Or else according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, that we should recognize the unhappy <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and humbly cover and purify the stains of a puffed-up and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit in the deep furrow of self-examination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> Sorcerers and idolatrous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> made use, in their rites, of the bones and flesh of dead men. Wherefore, in order to extirpate the customs of idolatrous worship, the Lord commanded that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of inferior degree, who at fixed times served in the temple, should not "incur an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> at the death" of anyone except of those who were closely related to them, viz. their father or mother, and others thus near of kin to them. But the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> had always to be ready for the service of the sanctuary; wherefore he was absolutely forbidden to approach the dead, however nearly related to him. They were also forbidden to marry a "harlot" or "one that has been put away," or any other than a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>: both on account of the reverence due to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of which would seem to be tarnished by such a marriage: and for the sake of the children who would be disgraced by the mother's shame: which was most of all to be avoided when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity was passed on from father to son. Again, they were commanded to shave neither head nor beard, and not to make incisions in their flesh, in order to exclude the rites of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shaved both head and beard, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/bar006.htm#verse30">Baruch 6:30</a>): "Priests sit in their temples having their garments rent, and their heads and beards shaven." Moreover, in worshipping their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> "they cut themselves with knives and lancets" (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse28">1 Kings 18:28</a>). For this reason the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were commanded to do the contrary.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> reason for these things is that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be entirely free from dead works, i.e. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And they should not shave their heads, i.e. set wisdom aside; nor should they shave their beards, i.e. set aside the perfection of wisdom; nor rend their garments or cut their flesh, i.e. they should not incur the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.
