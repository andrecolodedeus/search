<h1>Question 103. Dulia</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3103.htm#article1"> Is honor a spiritual or a corporal thing?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3103.htm#article2"> Is honor due to those only who are in a higher position?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3103.htm#article3"> Is dulia, which pays honor and worship to those who are above us, a special virtue, distinct from latria?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3103.htm#article4"> Does it contain several species?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether honor denotes something corporal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> does not denote something corporal. For <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is showing reverence in acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as may be gathered from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 5). Now showing reverence is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, since to revere is an act of fear, as stated above (81, 2, ad 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3), "<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Now, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists chiefly of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, its reward is not something corporal, for the reward is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> does not consist of corporal things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is distinct from praise, as also from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> consist of external things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> consists of things internal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in his exposition of <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse3">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, "Honor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed," and (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), "let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that rule well be esteemed worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>" etc. says (Ep. ad Ageruch.): "Honor here stands either for almsgiving or for remuneration." Now both of these pertain to  <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">corporal</a> things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> consists of corporal things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Honor denotes a witnessing to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> excellence. Therefore men who wish to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> seek a witnessing to their excellence, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 5; viii, 8). Now witness is borne either before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the searcher of hearts, the witness of one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> suffices. wherefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is concerned, may consist of the mere internal movement of the heart, for instance when a man acknowledges either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> excellence or another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> excellence before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But, as regards men, one cannot bear witness, save by means of signs, either by words, as when one proclaims another's excellence by word of mouth, or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, for instance by bowing, saluting, and so forth, or by external things, as by offering <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, erecting statues, and the like. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> consists of signs, external and corporal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Reverence is not the same as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: but on the one hand it is the primary motive for showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> honors another out of the reverence he has for him; and on the other hand, it is the end of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, in so far as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in order that he may be held in reverence by others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not a sufficient reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: yet nothing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and corporal things can be greater than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, since these corporal things themselves are employed as signs in acknowledgment of excelling <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is, however, due to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the beautiful, that they may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse15">Matthew 5:15</a>, "Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but upon a <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>, that it may shine to all that are in the house." In this sense <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is said to be the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Praise is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in two ways. First, because praise consists only of verbal signs, whereas <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> consists of any external signs, so that praise is included in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Secondly, because by paying <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> we bear witness to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> excelling <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> absolutely, whereas by praising him we bear witness to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in reference to an end: thus we praise one that works well for an end. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is given even to the best, which is not referred to an end, but has already arrived at the end, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 5).

<p><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">Glory</a> is the effect of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and praise, since the result of our bearing witness to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> becomes clear to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many. The word "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" signifies this, for "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" is the same as <em>kleria</em>, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse27">Romans 16:27</a> observes that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is "clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> together with praise."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether honor is properly due to those who are above us?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not properly due to those who are above us. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is above any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wayfarer, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>, "He that is lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>." Yet an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> forbade John when the latter wished to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him (<a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse10">Apocalypse 22:10</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due to those who are above us.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in acknowledgment of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (1; 63, 3). But sometimes those who are above us are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due to them, as neither is it due to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who nevertheless are above us in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse10">Romans 12:10</a>): "With <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> preventing one another," and we read (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse17">1 Peter 2:17</a>): "Honor all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But this would not be so if <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> were due to those alone who are above us. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due properly to those who are above us.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#verse16">Tobit 1:16</a>) that <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> "had ten talents of silver of that which he had been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the king": and we read (<a href="../bible/est006.htm#verse11">Esther 6:11</a>) that Assuerus <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> Mardochaeus, and ordered it to be proclaimed in his presence: "This <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is he worthy of whom the king hath a mind to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is paid to those also who are beneath us, and it seems, in consequence, that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not due properly to those who are above us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 12) that "<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to the best."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is nothing but an acknowledgment of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> excelling <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> excellence may be considered, not only in relation to those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him, in the point of his being more excellent than they, but also in itself, or in relation to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and in this way <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is always due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, on account of some excellence or superiority.

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> has no need to be more excellent than those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him; it may suffice for him to be more excellent than some others, or again he may be more excellent than those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him in some respect and not simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> forbade John to pay him, not any kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of adoration and latria, which is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or again, he forbade him to pay the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of dulia, in order to indicate the dignity of John himself, for which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> equaled him to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "according to the hope of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": wherefore he refused to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by him as though he were superior to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> superior is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for the excellence, not of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but of his dignity, as being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, and because the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> paid to him is paid to the whole community over which he presides. As for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> beyond recall, and should be looked upon as enemies, rather than treated with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be found something that makes it possible to deem him better than ourselves, according to <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>, "In <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, let each esteem others better than themselves," and thus, too, we should all be on the alert to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are sometimes <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by kings, not that they are above them in the order of dignity but on account of some excellence of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in this way <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> and Mardochaeus were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by kings.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether dulia is a special virtue distinct from latria?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that dulia is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse1">Psalm 7:1</a>, "O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Thee have I put my trust," says: "Lord of all by His power, to Whom dulia is due; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by creation, to Whom we owe <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Lord is not distinct from that which is directed to Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore dulia is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 8), "to be loved is like being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> with which we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as that whereby we love our neighbor. Therefore dulia whereby we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our neighbor is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from latria with which we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the movement whereby one is moved towards an image is the same as the movement whereby one is moved towards the thing represented by the image. Now by dulia we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> a man as being made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse22">Wisdom 2:22-23</a>) that "they esteemed not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incorruptible, and to the image of His own likeness He made him." Therefore dulia is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from latria whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei x), that "the homage due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> spoke when he commanded servants to obey their masters and which in Greek is called dulia, is distinct from latria which denotes the homage that consists in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to what has been stated above (Question 101, Article 3), where there are different aspects of that which is due, there must needs be different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to render those dues. Now servitude is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under different aspects: even as lordship is competent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under different aspects. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has absolute and paramount lordship over the creature wholly and singly, which is entirely subject to His power: whereas <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> partakes of a certain likeness to the divine lordship, forasmuch as he exercises a particular power over some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or creature. Wherefore dulia, which pays due service to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> lord, is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from latria, which pays due service to the lordship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, moreover, a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of observance, because by observance we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> all those who excel in dignity, while dulia properly speaking is the reverence of servants for their master, dulia being the Greek for servitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as religion is called piety by way of excellence, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our Father by way of excellence, so again latria is called dulia by way of excellence, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> by way of excellence. Now the creature does not partake of the power to create by reason of which latria is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and so this <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> drew a distinction, by ascribing latria to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect of creation, which is not communicated to a creature, but dulia in respect of lordship, which is communicated to a creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason why we love our neighbor is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since that which we love in our neighbor through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> with which we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as that with which we love our neighbor. Yet there are other friendships distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in respect of the other reasons for which a man is loved. On like manner, since there is one reason for serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and another for serving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and for honoring the one or the other, latria and dulia are not the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Movement towards an image as such is referred to the thing represented by the image: yet not every movement towards an image is referred to the image as such, and consequently sometimes the movement to the image differs specifically from the movement to the thing. Accordingly we must reply that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or subjection of dulia regards some dignity of a man absolutely. For though, in respect of that dignity, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made to the image or likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet in showing reverence to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, one does not always refer this to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> actually.

<p>Or we may reply that the movement towards an image is, after a fashion, towards the thing, yet the movement towards the thing need not be towards its image. Wherefore reverence paid to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> redounds somewhat to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and yet this differs from the reverence that is paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, for this in no way refers to His image.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether dulia has various species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that dulia has various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For by dulia we show <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to our neighbor. Now different neighbors are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> under different aspects, for instance king, father and master, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ix, 2). Since this difference of aspect in the object differentiates the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it seems that dulia is divided into specifically different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the mean differs specifically from the extremes, as pale differs from white and black. Now hyperdulia is apparently a mean between latria and dulia: for it is shown towards creatures having a special affinity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for instance to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as being the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that there are different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of dulia, one being simply dulia, the other hyperdulia.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as in the rational creature we find the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for which reason it is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, so too in the irrational creature we find the trace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the aspect of likeness denoted by an image differs from the aspect conveyed by a trace. Therefore we must distinguish a corresponding difference of dulia: and all the more since <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is shown to certain irrational creatures, as, for instance, to the wood of the Holy Cross.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Dulia is condivided with <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>. But latria is not divided into different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Neither therefore is dulia.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Dulia may be taken in two ways. On one way it may be taken in a wide sense as denoting reverence paid to anyone on account of any kind of excellence, and thus it comprises piety and observance, and any similar <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby reverence is shown towards a man. Taken in this sense it will have parts differing specifically from one another. On another way it may be taken in a strict sense as denoting the reverence of a servant for his lord, for dulia signifies servitude, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Taken in this sense it is not divided into different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but is one of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of observance, mentioned by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii), for the reason that a servant reveres his lord under one aspect, a soldier his commanding officer under another, the disciple his master under another, and so on in similar cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes dulia in a wide sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hyperdulia is the highest <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of dulia taken in a wide sense, since the greatest reverence is that which is due to a man by reason of his having an affinity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man owes neither subjection nor <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to an irrational creature considered in itself, indeed all such creatures are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. As to the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> we pay to it is the same as that which we pay to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, just as the king's robe receives the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as the king himself, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iv).
