<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the ceremonies of the Law were in existence before the Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> were in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and holocausts were ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as stated above (Question 101, Article 4). But <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and holocausts preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse3">Genesis 4:3-4</a>) that "Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to the Lord," and that "<a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a> offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat." <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> also "offered holocausts" to the Lord (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse20">Genesis 18:20</a>), and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did in like manner (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse13">Genesis 22:13</a>). Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the erecting and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> of the altar were part of the ceremonies relating to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things. But these preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For we read (<a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse18">Genesis 13:18</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> . . . built . . . an altar to the Lord"; and (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse18">Genesis 28:18</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> . . . took the stone . . . and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it." Therefore the legal ceremonies preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the first of the legal <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> seems to have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen017.htm">Genesis 17</a>. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis 14:18</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> . . . was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore the sacramental ceremonies preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the distinction of clean from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> animals belongs to the ceremonies of observances, as stated above (100, 2, 6, ad 1). But this distinction preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse2">Genesis 7:2-3</a>): "Of all clean beasts take seven and seven . . . but of the beasts that are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, two and two." Therefore the legal ceremonies preceded the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>): "These are the precepts and ceremonies . . . which the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded that I should teach you." But they would not have needed to be taught about these things, if the aforesaid ceremonies had been already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore the legal ceremonies did not precede the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is clear from what has been said (101, 2; 102, 2), the legal ceremonies were ordained for a double purpose; the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the foreshadowing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now whoever worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must needs worship Him by means of certain fixed things pertaining to external worship. But the fixing of the divine worship belongs to the ceremonies; just as the determining of our relations with our neighbor is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> determined by the judicial precepts, as stated above (Question 99, Article 4). Consequently, as among men in general there were certain judicial precepts, not indeed established by Divine authority, but ordained by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; so also there were some ceremonies fixed, not by the authority of any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and devotion of those that worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, however, even before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> some of the leading men were gifted with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that a heavenly <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, like a private <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, prompted them to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a certain definite way, which would be both in keeping with the interior worship, and a suitable token of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mysteries, which were foreshadowed also by other things that they did, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>: "All . . . things happened to them in figure." Therefore there were some ceremonies before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but they were not legal ceremonies, because they were not as yet established by legislation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The patriarchs offered up these oblations, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and holocausts previously to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, out of a certain devotion of their own will, according as it seemed proper to them to offer up in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> those things which they had received from Him, and thus to testify that they worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the beginning and end of all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> They also established certain sacred things, because they thought that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> demanded that certain places should be set apart from others for the purpose of divine worship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sacrament of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was established by command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Hence it cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> as though it were an institution of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but only as an observance included in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse20">John 7:20</a>) that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was "not of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but of his fathers." Again, among those who worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> appointment, for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> allotted the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity to the firstborn.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The distinction of clean from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> animals was in vogue before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, not with regard to eating them, since it is written (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis 9:3</a>): "Everything that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you": but only as to the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> because they used only certain animals for that purpose. If, however, they did make any distinction in regard to eating; it was not that it was considered illegal to eat such animals, since this was not forbidden by any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but from dislike or custom: thus even now we see that certain foods are looked upon with disgust in some countries, while people partake of them in others.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether, at the time of the Law, the ceremonies of the Old Law had any power of justification?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had the power of justification at the time of the Law. Because expiation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. But it is written (<a href="../bible/exo039.htm#verse21">Exodus 39:21</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and their apparel were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the sprinkling of blood and the anointing of oil; and (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm#verse16">Leviticus 16:16</a>) that, by sprinkling the blood of the calf, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> expiated "the sanctuary from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and from their transgressions and . . . their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had the power of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pleases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse8">Psalm 10:8</a>: "The Lord is just and hath loved <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But some pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of ceremonies, according to <a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse19">Leviticus 10:19</a>: "How could I . . . please the Lord in the ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?" Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had the power of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things relating to the divine worship regard the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than the body, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse8">Psalm 18:8</a>: "The Law of the Lord is unspotted, converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was cleansed by means of the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/lev014.htm">Leviticus 14</a>. Much more therefore could the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> cleanse the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by justifying it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm">Galatians 2</a>) [The first words of the quotation are from <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse21">3:21</a>: <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> probably quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, substituted them for <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse21">2:21</a>, which runs thus: 'If <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain.']: "If there had been a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given which could justify [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'give life'], <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain," i.e. without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this is inadmissible. Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not confer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (102, 5, ad 4), a twofold <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was distinguished in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. One was <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and is the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The other was corporal, which rendered a man unfit for divine worship; thus a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, or anyone that touched carrion, was said to be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> was nothing but a kind of irregularity. From this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, then, the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had the power to cleanse: because they were ordered by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be employed as remedies for the removal of the aforesaid uncleannesses which were contracted in consequence of the prescription of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse13">Hebrews 9:13</a>) that "the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of a heifer, being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh." And just as this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> which was washed away by such like ceremonies, affected the flesh rather than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so also the ceremonies themselves are called by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> shortly before (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse10">Hebrews 9:10</a>) justices of the flesh: "justices of the flesh," says he, "being laid on them until the time of correction."

<p>On the other hand, they had no power of cleansing from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, i.e. from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The reason of this was that at no time could there be expiation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "Who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>'] of the world" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John 1:29</a>). And since the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> had not yet really taken place, those ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> could not really contain in themselves a power flowing from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> already <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> and crucified, such as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> contain. Consequently they could not cleanse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse4">Hebrews 10:4</a>) that "it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be taken away"; and for this reason he calls them (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians 4:9</a>) "weak and needy elements": weak indeed, because they cannot take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but this weakness results from their being needy, i.e. from the fact that they do not contain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> within themselves.

<p>However, it was possible at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, to be united by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> and crucified; so that they were justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: of which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the observance of these ceremonies was a sort of profession, inasmuch as they foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered up for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not as though the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> themselves washed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> away, but because they were professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In fact, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> itself implies this in the terms employed: for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev004.htm#verse16">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="../bible/lev005.htm#verse16">5:16</a>) that in offering the sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him . . . and it shall be forgiven him," as though the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were forgiven, not in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but through the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion of those who offered them. It must be observed, however, that the very fact that the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> washed away <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the body, was a figure of that expiation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which was effected by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>It is therefore evident that under the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the ceremonies had no power of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That sanctification of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and their sons, and of their apparel or of anything else belonging to them, by sprinkling them with blood, had no other effect but to appoint them to the divine worship, and to remove <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediments</a> from them, "to the cleansing of the flesh," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse13">Hebrews 9:13</a>) in token of that sanctification whereby "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" sanctified "the people by His own blood" (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews 13:12</a>). Moreover, the expiation must be understood as referring to the removal of these bodily uncleannesses, not to the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence even the sanctuary which could not be the subject of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is stated to be expiated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the ceremonies by their obedience and devotion, and by their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the reality foreshadowed; not by reason of the things considered in themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those ceremonies which were prescribed in the cleansing of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, were not ordained for the purpose of taking away the defilement of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. This is clear from the fact that these ceremonies were not applied to a man until he was already healed: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/lev014.htm#verse3">Leviticus 14:3-4</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, "going out of the camp, when he shall find that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is cleansed, shall command him that is to be purified to offer," etc.; whence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed the judge of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, not before, but after cleansing. But these ceremonies were employed for the purpose of taking away the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. They do say, however, that if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in his judgment, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> would be cleansed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not in virtue of the sacrifice. Thus also it was by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that the thigh of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> rotted, when she had drunk the water "on which" the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had "heaped curses," as stated in <a href="../bible/num005.htm#verse19">Numbers 5:19-27</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the ceremonies of the Old Law ceased at the coming of Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not cease at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/bar004.htm#verse1">Baruch 4:1</a>): "This is the book of the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is for ever." But the legal ceremonies were part of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore the legal ceremonies were to last for ever.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the offering made by a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> after being cleansed was a ceremony of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. But the Gospel commands the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, who has been cleansed, to make this offering (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse4">Matthew 8:4</a>). Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not cease at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as long as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remains, the effect remains. But the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had certain reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, inasmuch as they were ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides the fact that they were intended to be figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should not have ceased.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted as a sign of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, to recall the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of creation: and other solemnities, in memory of other Divine favors, as state above (102, 4, ad 10; 5, ad 1). But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is ever to be imitated even by us: and the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of creation and other Divine favors should never be forgotten. Therefore at least <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the other legal solemnities should not have ceased.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians 2:16-17</a>): "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come": and (<a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse13">Hebrews 8:13</a>): "In saying a new (testament), he hath made the former old: and that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> were ordained to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as stated above (101, A1,2). Now external worship should be in proportion to the internal worship, which consists in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently exterior worship had to be subject to variations according to the variations in the internal worship, in which a threefold state may be distinguished. One state was in respect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, both in heavenly goods, and in the means of obtaining them--in both of these considered as things to come. Such was the state of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Another state of interior worship is that in which we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in heavenly goods as things to come; but in the means of obtaining heavenly goods, as in things present or past. Such is the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. The third state is that in which both are possessed as present; wherein nothing is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in as lacking, nothing hoped for as being yet to come. Such is the state of the Blessed.

<p>In this state of the Blessed, then, nothing in regard to worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be figurative; there will be naught but "thanksgiving and voice of praise" (<a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse3">Isaiah 51:3</a>). Hence it is written concerning the city of the Blessed (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse22">Apocalypse 21:22</a>): "I saw no temple therein: for the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Almighty is the temple thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>." Proportionately, therefore, the ceremonies of the first-mentioned state which foreshadowed the second and third states, had need to cease at the advent of the second state; and other ceremonies had to be introduced which would be in keeping with the state of divine worship for that particular time, wherein heavenly goods are a thing of the future, but the Divine favors whereby we obtain the heavenly boons are a thing of the present.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is said to be "for ever" simply and absolutely, as regards its moral precepts; but as regards the ceremonial precepts it lasts for even in respect of the reality which those ceremonies foreshadowed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the redemption of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said then: "It is consummated" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse30">John 19:30</a>). Consequently the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> must have ceased then altogether through their reality being fulfilled. As a sign of this, we read that at the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> "the veil of the temple was rent" (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse51">Matthew 27:51</a>). Hence, before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was preaching and working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the Gospel were concurrent, since the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had already begun, but was not as yet consummated. And for this reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, commanded the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> to observe the legal ceremonies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The literal reasons already given (102) for the ceremonies refer to the divine worship, which was founded on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in that which was to come. Hence, at the advent of Him Who was to come, both that worship ceased, and all the reasons referring thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was commended in that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> promise concerning his seed to come, in which all nations were to blessed. Wherefore, as long as this seed was yet to come, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make profession of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. But now that it is consummated, the same thing needs to be declared by means of another sign, viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, which, in this respect, took the place of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians 2:11-12</a>): "You are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, buried with Him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>."

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, which was a sign recalling the first creation, its place is taken by the "Lord's Day," which recalls the beginning of the new creature in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>. In like manner other solemnities of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> are supplanted by new solemnities: because the blessings vouchsafed to that people, foreshadowed the favors granted us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence the feast of the Passover gave place to the feast of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>: the feast of Pentecost when the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was given, to the feast of Pentecost on which was given the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the living spirit: the feast of the New Moon, to <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">Lady Day</a>, when appeared the first rays of the sun, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: the feast of Trumpets, to the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>: the feast of Expiation, to the feasts of Martyrs and Confessors: the feast of Tabernacles, to the feast of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Dedication: the feast of the Assembly and Collection, to feast of the Angels, or else to the feast of All Hallows.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether since Christ's Passion the legal ceremonies can be observed without committing mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> the legal ceremonies can be observed without committing mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> committed mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: since by His fulness they were "endued with power from on high" (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse49">Luke 24:49</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> observed the legal ceremonies after the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for it is stated (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse3">Acts 16:3</a>) that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy: and (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse26">Acts 21:26</a>) that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, at the advice of James, "took the men, and . . . being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one of them." Therefore the legal ceremonies can be observed since the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one of the legal ceremonies consisted in shunning the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But the first Pastor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> complied with this observance; for it is stated (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse12">Galatians 2:12</a>) that, "when" certain men "had come" to Antioch, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> "withdrew and separated himself" from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Therefore the legal ceremonies can be observed since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> without committing mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the commands of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not lead men into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it was commanded by apostolic decree that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should observe certain ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse28">Acts 15:28-29</a>): "It hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and to us, to lay no further burden upon you than these <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things: that you abstain from things sacrificed to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication." Therefore the legal ceremonies can be observed since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> without committing mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians 5:2</a>): "If you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall profit you nothing." But nothing save mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hinders us from receiving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> fruit. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, or to observe the other legal ceremonies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> All ceremonies are professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in which the interior worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can make profession of his inward <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as well as by words: and in either profession, if he make a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> declaration, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Now, though our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the same as that of the fathers of old; yet, since they came before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereas we come after Him, the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is expressed in different words, by us and by them. For by them was it said: "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son," where the verbs are in the future tense: whereas we express the same by means of verbs in the past tense, and say that she "conceived and bore." In like manner the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> betokened <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as having yet to be born and to suffer: whereas our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> signify Him as already born and having suffered. Consequently, just as it would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> now for anyone, in making a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is yet to be born, which the fathers of old said devoutly and truthfully; so too it would be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> now to observe those ceremonies which the fathers of old fulfilled with devotion and fidelity. Such is the teaching <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xix, 16), who says: "It is no longer promised that He shall be born, shall suffer and rise again, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of which their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were a kind of image: but it is declared that He is already born, has suffered and risen again; of which our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> share, are the actual representation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> On this point there seems to have been a difference of opinion between <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Super Galat. ii, 11, seqq.) distinguished two periods of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. One was the time previous to <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, during which the legal ceremonies were neither dead, since they were obligatory, and did expiate in their own fashion; nor deadly, because it was not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to observe them. But immediately after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> they began to be not only dead, so as no longer to be either effectual or binding; but also deadly, so that whoever observed them was guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence he maintained that after the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> never observed the legal ceremonies in real earnest; but only by a kind of pious pretense, lest, to wit, they should <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and hinder their conversion. This pretense, however, is to be understood, not as though they did not in reality perform those actions, but in the sense that they performed them without the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to observe the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: thus a man might cut away his foreskin for health's sake, not with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of observing legal <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.

<p>But since it seems unbecoming that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, should have hidden things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life and doctrine, and that they should have made use of pretense, in things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the faithful; therefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Epist. lxxxii) more fittingly distinguished three periods of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. One was the time that preceded the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, during which the legal ceremonies were neither deadly nor dead: another period was after the publication of the Gospel, during which the legal ceremonies are both dead and deadly. The third is a middle period, viz. from the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a> until the publication of the Gospel, during which the legal ceremonies were dead indeed, because they had neither effect nor binding force; but were not deadly, because it was lawful for the Jewish converts to Christianity to observe them, provided they did not put their trust in them so as to hold them to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as though <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not justify without the legal observances. On the other hand, there was no reason why those who were converted from heathendom to Christianity should observe them. Hence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, who was born of a Jewish mother; but was unwilling to circumcise <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Titus</a>, who was of heathen nationality.

<p>The reason why the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not wish the converted <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to be debarred at once from observing the legal ceremonies, while converted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> were forbidden to observe the rites of heathendom, was in order to show that there is a difference between these rites. For heathenish ceremonial was rejected as absolutely unlawful, and as prohibited by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for all time; whereas the legal ceremonial ceased as being fulfilled through <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, being instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> withdrew himself from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by pretense, in order to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom he was the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>. Hence he did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all in acting thus. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in like manner made a pretense of blaming him, in order to avoid scandalizing the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> he was. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> disapproves of this solution: because in the canonical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (viz. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians 2:11</a>), wherein we must not hold anything to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> "was to be blamed." Consequently it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was at fault: and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> blamed him in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and not with pretense. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, however, did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by observing the legal ceremonial for the time being; because this was lawful for him who was a converted <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>. But he did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by excessive minuteness in the observance of the legal rites lest he should <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, the result being that he gave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have held that this prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is not to be taken literally, but spiritually: namely, that the prohibition of blood signifies the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; the prohibition of things strangled, that of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and rapine; the prohibition of things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; while fornication is forbidden as being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself: which opinion they gathered from certain glosses, which expound these prohibitions in a mystical sense. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and rapine were held to be unlawful even by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, there would have been no need to give this special commandment to those who were converted to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from heathendom. Hence others maintain that those foods were forbidden literally, not to prevent the observance of legal ceremonies, but in order to prevent <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse31">Ezekiel 44:31</a> ("The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall not eat of anything that is dead"): "He condemns those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> did not keep these precepts."

<p>But since certain foods are more delicate than these and more conducive to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, there seems no reason why these should have been forbidden more than the others.

<p>We must therefore follow the third opinion, and hold that these foods were forbidden literally, not with the purpose of enforcing compliance with the legal ceremonies, but in order to further the union of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> living side by side. Because blood and things strangled were loathsome to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> by ancient custom; while the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> might have suspected the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> of relapse into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> if the latter had partaken of things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Hence these things were prohibited for the time being, during which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were to become united together. But as time went on, with the lapse of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect lapsed also, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel teaching was divulged, wherein <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> taught that "not that which entereth into the mouth defileth a man" (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>); and that "nothing is to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving" (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>). With regard to fornication a special prohibition was made, because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> did not hold it to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.
