<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the world is governed by anyone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the world is not governed by anyone. For it belongs to those things to be governed, which move or work for an end. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which make up the greater part of the world do not move, or work for an end; for they have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their end. Therefore the world is not governed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those things are governed which are moved towards an object. But the world does not appear to be so directed, but has stability in itself. Therefore it is not governed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> determined by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to one particular thing, does not require any external principle of government. But the principal parts of the world are by a certain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> determined to something particular in their actions and movements. Therefore the world does not require to be governed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse3">Wisdom 14:3</a>): "But Thou, O Father, governest all things by Thy Providence." And <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii): "Thou Who governest this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by mandate <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Certain ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> denied the government of the world, saying that all things happened by chance. But such an opinion can be refuted as impossible in two ways.

<p>First, by observation of things themselves: for we observe that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> things happen always or nearly always for the best; which would not be the case unless some sort of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> directed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as an end; which is to govern. Wherefore the unfailing order we observe in things is a sign of their being governed; for instance, if we enter a well-ordered house we gather therefrom the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of him that put it in order, as Tullius says (De Nat. Deorum ii), quoting <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> [Cleanthes].

<p>Secondly, this is clear from a consideration of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which, as we have said above (44, 4; 65, 2), was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the production of things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For as "it belongs to the best to produce the best," it is not fitting that the supreme <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should produce things without giving them their perfection. Now a thing's ultimate perfection consists in the attainment of its end. Therefore it belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as it brought things into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, so to lead them to their end: and this is to govern.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing moves or operates for an end in two ways.

<p>First, in moving itself to the end, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other rational creatures; and such things have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their end, and of the means to the end.

<p>Secondly, a thing is said to move or operate for an end, as though moved or directed by another thereto, as an arrow directed to the target by the archer, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the end unknown to the arrow. Wherefore, as the movement of the arrow towards a definite end shows clearly that it is directed by someone with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so the unvarying course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which are without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, shows clearly that the world is governed by some reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things there is a stable element, at least primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and something belonging to movement, if under movement we include operation. And things need governing as to both: because even that which is stable, since it is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> from nothing, would return to nothingness were it not sustained by a governing hand, as will be explained later (104, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> inherent in those beings which are determined to a particular thing, is a kind of impression from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, directing them to their end; as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> whereby an arrow is moved so as to fly towards a certain point is an impression from the archer, and not from the arrow. But there is a difference, inasmuch as that which creatures receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while that which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things receive from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in addition to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is somewhat <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>. Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in the movement of the arrow shows the action of the archer, so the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of things shows the government of Divine Providence.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the end of the government of the world is something outside the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the end of the government of the world is not something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside the world. For the end of the government of a thing is that whereto the thing governed is brought. But that whereto a thing is brought is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the thing itself; thus a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is brought back to health, which is something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in him. Therefore the end of government of things is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not outside, but within the things themselves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 1): "Some ends are an operation; some are a work"--i.e. produced by an operation. But nothing can be produced by the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> outside itself; and operation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the agent. Therefore nothing extrinsic can be the end of the government of things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the multitude seems to consist in order, and peace which is the "tranquillity of order," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13). But the world is composed of a multitude of things. Therefore the end of the government of the world is the peaceful order in things themselves. Therefore the end of the government of the world is not an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse4">Proverbs 16:4</a>): "The Lord hath made all things for Himself." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is outside the entire order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Therefore the end of all things is something extrinsic to them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning, it is not possible to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the end of things if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their beginning. Therefore, since the beginning of all things is something outside the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is clear from what has been expounded above (44, 1,2), that we must conclude that the end of all things is some extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by reason. For it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an end; wherefore, a particular end of anything consists in some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; while the universal end of all things is the Universal Good; Which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of Itself by virtue of Its Essence, Which is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; whereas a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by participation. Now it is manifest that in the whole <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> there is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not such by participation. Wherefore that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is the end of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> must be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We may acquire some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in many ways: first, as a form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in us, such as health or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; secondly, as something done by us, as a builder attains his end by building a house; thirdly, as something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed or acquired by us, as the buyer of a field attains his end when he enters into possession. Wherefore nothing prevents something outside the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> being the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which it is directed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is speaking of the ends of various arts; for the end of some arts consists in the operation itself, as the end of a harpist is to play the harp; whereas the end of other arts consists in something produced, as the end of a builder is not the act of building, but the house he builds. Now it may happen that something extrinsic is the end not only as made, but also as possessed or acquired or even as represented, as if we were to say that Hercules is the end of the statue made to represent him. Therefore we may say that some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> outside the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is the end of the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as something possessed and represented; for each thing tends to a participation thereof, and to an assimilation thereto, as far as is possible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, namely, the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is an end thereof; this. however, is not its ultimate end, but is ordered to the extrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to the end: thus the order in an army is ordered to the general, as stated in Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the world is governed by one?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the world is not governed by one. For we judge the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by the effect. Now, we see in the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> that things are not moved and do not operate uniformly, but some contingently and some of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in variously different ways. Therefore the world is not governed by one.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, things which are governed by one do not act against each other, except by the incapacity or unskillfulness of the ruler; which cannot apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things agree not together, and act against each other; as is evident in the case of contraries. Therefore the world is not governed by one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we always find what is the better. But it "is better that two should be together than one" (<a href="../bible/ecc004.htm#verse9">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>). Therefore the world is not governed by one, but by many.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We confess our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and one Lord, according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>): "To us there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father . . . and one Lord": and both of these pertain to government. For to the Lord belongs dominion over subjects; and the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken from Providence as stated above (Question 13, Article 8). Therefore the world is governed by one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> say that the world is governed by one. For since the end of the government of the world is that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the government of the world must be the best kind of government. Now the best government is the government by one. The reason of this is that government is nothing but the directing of the things governed to the end; which consists in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But unity belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> proves (De Consol. iii, 11) from this, that, as all things desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so do they desire unity; without which they would cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. For a thing so far <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> as it is one. Whence we observe that things resist division, as far as they can; and the dissolution of a thing arises from defect therein. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a ruler over a multitude is unity, or peace. Now the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unity is one. For it is clear that several cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unity or concord, except so far as they are united. Furthermore, what is one in itself is a more apt and a better <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unity than several things united. Therefore a multitude is better governed by one than by several. From this it follows that the government of the world, being the best form of government, must be by one. This is expressed by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10): "Things refuse to be ill governed; and multiplicity of authorities is a bad thing, therefore there should be one ruler."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Movement is "the act of a thing moved, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the mover." Wherefore dissimilarity of movements is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by diversity of things moved, which diversity is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (47, 1,2; 48, 2), and not by a diversity of governors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although contraries do not agree with each other in their proximate ends, nevertheless they agree in the ultimate end, so far as they are included in the one order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If we consider <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> goods, then two are better than one. But if we consider the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, then no addition is possible.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the effect of government is one or many?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is but one effect of the government of the world and not many. For the effect of government is that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the things governed. This is one, namely, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which consists in order; as may be seen in the example of an army. Therefore the government of the world has but one effect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, from one there <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> proceeds but one. But the world is governed by one as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (3). Therefore also the effect of this government is but one.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the effect of government is not one by reason of the unity of the Governor, it must be many by reason of the many things governed. But these are too numerous to be counted. Therefore we cannot assign any definite number to the effects of government.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contains all and fills all by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." But government belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Therefore there are certain definite effects of the Divine government.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The effect of any action may be judged from its end; because it is by action that the attainment of the end is effected. Now the end of the government of the world is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to the participation and similarity of which all things tend. Consequently the effect of the government of the world may be taken in three ways.

<p>First, on the part of the end itself; and in this way there is but one effect, that is, assimilation to the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">supreme good</a>.

<p>Secondly, the effect of the government of the world may be considered on the part of those things by means of which the creature is made like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus there are, in general, two effects of the government. For the creature is assimilated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two things; first, with regard to this, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and so the creature becomes like Him by being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and secondly, with regard to this, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in others; and so the creature becomes like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by moving others to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore there are two effects of government, the preservation of things in their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and the moving of things to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Thirdly, we may consider in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> the effects of the government of the world; and in this way they are without number.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> includes both the preservation of things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their movement. As regards these two things we find order among them, inasmuch as one is better than another; and one is moved by another.

<p>From what has been said above, we can gather the replies to the other two objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all things are subject to the Divine government?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not all things are subject to the Divine government. For it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse11">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>): "I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to the learned, nor favor to the skillful, but time and chance in all." But things subject to the Divine government are not ruled by chance. Therefore those things which are under the sun are not subject to the Divine government.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath no care for oxen." But he that governs has care for the things he governs. Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine government.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what can govern itself needs not to be governed by another. But the rational creature can govern itself; since it is master of its own act, and acts of itself; and is not made to act by another, which seems proper to things which are governed. Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine government.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 11): "Not only <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, even the bowels of the lowest animal, even the wing of the bird, the flower of the plant, the leaf of the tree, hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> endowed with every fitting detail of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore all things are subject to His government.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> For the same reason is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the ruler of things as He is their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because the same gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as gives perfection; and this belongs to government. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not indeed only of some particular kind of being, but of the whole universal being, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (44, 1,2). Wherefore, as there can be nothing which is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so there can be nothing which is not subject to His government. This can also be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the end of government. For a man's government extends over all those things which come under the end of his government. Now the end of the Divine government is the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; as we have shown (2). Wherefore, as there can be nothing that is not ordered to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as its end, as is clear from what we have said above (44, 4; 65, 2), so it is impossible for anything to escape from the Divine government.

<p>Foolish therefore was the opinion of those who said that the corruptible lower world, or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things, or that even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, were not subject to the Divine government. These are represented as saying, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath abandoned the earth" (<a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse9">Ezekiel 9:9</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These things are said to be under the sun which are generated and corrupted according to the sun's movement. In all such things we find chance: not that everything is casual which occurs in such things; but that in each one there is an element of chance. And the very fact that an element of chance is found in those things proves that they are subject to government of some kind. For unless corruptible things were governed by a higher being, they would tend to nothing definite, especially those which possess no kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. So nothing would happen unintentionally; which constitutes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of chance. Wherefore to show how things happen by chance and yet according to the ordering of a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, he does not say absolutely that he observes chance in all things, but "time and chance," that is to say, that defects may be found in these things according to some order of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Government implies a certain change effected by the governor in the things governed. Now every movement is the act of a movable thing, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the moving principle, as is laid down Phys. iii, 3. And every act is proportionate to that of which it is an act. Consequently, various movable things must be moved variously, even as regards movement by one and the same mover. Thus by the one art of the Divine governor, various things are variously governed according to their variety. Some, according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, act of themselves, having dominion over their actions; and these are governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only in this, that they are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who works in them interiorly; but also in this, that they are induced by Him to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to fly from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by precepts and prohibitions, rewards and punishments. But irrational creatures which do not act but are acted upon, are not thus governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath no care for oxen," he does not wholly withdraw them from the Divine government, but only as regards the way in which rational creatures are governed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rational creature governs itself by its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, both of which require to be governed and perfected by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. Therefore above the government whereby the rational creature governs itself as master of its own act, it requires to be governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether all things are immediately governed by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all things are governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately. For <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.) reproves the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> who divides <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> into three parts. The first he ascribes to the supreme god, who watches over heavenly things and all universals; the second <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> he attributes to the secondary deities, who go the round of the heavens to watch over generation and corruption; while he ascribes a third <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to certain spirits who are guardians on earth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. Therefore it seems that all things are immediately governed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is better that a thing be done by one, if possible, than by many, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. viii, 6). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can by Himself govern all things without any intermediary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore it seems that He governs all things immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing is defective or imperfect. But it seems to be imperfect in a ruler to govern by means of others; thus an earthly king, by reason of his not being able to do everything himself, and because he cannot be everywhere at the same time, requires to govern by means of ministers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governs all things immediately.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4): "As the lower and grosser bodies are ruled in a certain orderly way by bodies of greater subtlety and power; so all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life; and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and unfaithful spirit is ruled by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and just spirit of life; and this spirit by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In government there are two things to be considered; the design of government, which is <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> itself; and the execution of the design. As to the design of government, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governs all things immediately; whereas in its execution, He governs some things by means of others.

<p>The reason of this is that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, so everything must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its highest degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in any practical order, design or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (and such is the design of government) consists in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> acted upon; as the best physician is not the one who can only give his attention to general principles, but who can consider the least details; and so on in other things. Therefore we must say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the design of the government of all things, even of the very least.

<p>But since things which are governed should be brought to perfection by government, this government will be so much the better in the degree the things governed are brought to perfection. Now it is a greater perfection for a thing to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself and also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in others, than only to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so governs things that He makes some of them to be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of others in government; as a master, who not only imparts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to his pupils, but gives also the faculty of teaching others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion is to be rejected, because he held that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not govern all things immediately, even in the design of government; this is clear from the fact that he divided <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which is the design of government, into three parts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governed alone, things would be deprived of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. Wherefore all that is effected by many would not be accomplished by one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That an earthly king should have ministers to execute his laws is a sign not only of his being imperfect, but also of his dignity; because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power is brought into greater evidence.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether anything can happen outside the order of the Divine government?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem possible that something may occur outside the order of the Divine government. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> disposes all for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine government, it would follow that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing that is in accordance with the pre-ordination of a ruler occurs by chance. Therefore, if nothing occurs outside the order of the Divine government, it follows that there is nothing fortuitous and casual.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the order of Divine Providence is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> and unchangeable; because it is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> design. Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine government, it follows that all things happen by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and nothing is <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore it is possible for something to occur outside the order of the Divine government.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/est013.htm#verse9">Esther 13:9</a>): "O Lord, Lord, almighty King, all things are in Thy power, and there is none that can resist Thy will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is possible for an effect to result outside the order of some particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but not outside the order of the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. The reason of this is that no effect results outside the order of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, except through some other impeding <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; which other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must itself be reduced to the first universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as indigestion may occur outside the order of the nutritive power by some such impediment as the coarseness of the food, which again is to be ascribed to some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and so on till we come to the first universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not of one genus only, but of all being in general, it is impossible for anything to occur outside the order of the Divine government; but from the very fact that from one point of view something seems to evade the order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> considered in regard to one particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> come back to that order as regards some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is nothing wholly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is ever founded on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as shown above (Question 48, Article 3). Therefore something is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through its escaping from the order of some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. If it wholly escaped from the order of the Divine government, it would wholly cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things are said to be fortuitous as regards some particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from the order of which they escape. But as to the order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, "nothing in the world happens by chance," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (QQ. 83, qu. 24).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain effects are said to be contingent as compared to their proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which may fail in their effects; and not as though anything could happen entirely outside the order of Divine government. The very fact that something occurs outside the order of some proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is owing to some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, itself subject to the Divine government.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether anything can resist the order of the Divine government?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem possible that some resistance can be made to the order of the Divine government. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse8">Isaiah 3:8</a>): "Their tongue and their devices are against the Lord."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a king does not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punish those who do not rebel against his commands. Therefore if no one rebelled against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commands, no one would be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything is subject to the order of the Divine government. But some things oppose others. Therefore some things rebel against the order of the Divine government.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii): "There is nothing that can desire or is able to resist this sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is this sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> therefore that ruleth all mightily and ordereth all sweetly," as is said (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm">Wisdom 8</a>) of Divine wisdom.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may consider the order of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> in two ways: in general, inasmuch as it proceeds from the governing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all; and in particular, inasmuch as it proceeds from some particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which executes the order of the Divine government.

<p>Considered in the first way, nothing can resist the order of the Divine government. This can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in two ways: firstly from the fact that the order of the Divine government is wholly directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and everything by its own operation and effort tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> only, "for no one acts intending <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): secondly from the fact that, as we have said above (1, ad 3; 5, ad 2), every inclination of anything, whether <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, is nothing but a kind of impression from the first mover; as the inclination of the arrow towards a fixed point is nothing but an impulse received from the archer. Wherefore every agent, whether <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or free, attains to its divinely appointed end, as though of its own accord. For this reason <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said "to order all things sweetly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some are said to think or speak, or act against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: not that they entirely resist the order of the Divine government; for even the sinner intends the attainment of a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but because they resist some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which belongs to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or state. Therefore they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2</strong> is clear from the above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the fact that one thing opposes another, it follows that some one thing can resist the order of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but not that order which depends on the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things.
