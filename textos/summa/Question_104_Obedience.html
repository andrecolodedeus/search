<h1>Question 104. Obedience</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article1"> Is one man bound to obey another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article2"> Is obedience a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article3"> Its comparison with other virtues</a> <li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article4"> Must God be obeyed in all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article5"> Are subjects bound to obey their superiors in all things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3104.htm#article6"> Are the faithful bound to obey the secular power?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether one man is bound to obey another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to obey another. For nothing should be done contrary to the divine ordinance. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has so ordered that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ruled by his own counsel, according to <a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to obey another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were bound to obey another, he would have to look upon the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commanding him, as being his rule of conduct. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will alone, which is always right, is a rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to obey none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more gratuitous the service the more is it acceptable. Now what a man does out of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is not gratuitous. Therefore if a man were bound in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to obey others in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, for this very reason his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> would be rendered less acceptable through being done out of obedience. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to obey another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is prescribed (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a>): "Obey your <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and be subject to them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as the actions of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things proceed from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, so do <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions proceed from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. On <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things it behooved the higher to move the lower to their actions by the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power bestowed on them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and so in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs also the higher must move the lower by their will in virtue of a divinely established authority. Now to move by reason and <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is to command. Wherefore just as in virtue of the divinely established <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things need to be subject to the movement of the higher, so too in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, in virtue of the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>, inferiors are bound to obey their superiors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the hand of his own counsel, not as though it were lawful to him to do whatever he will, but because, unlike irrational creatures, he is not compelled by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to do what he ought to do, but is left the free choice proceeding from his own counsel. And just as he has to proceed on his own counsel in doing other things, so too has he in the point of obeying his superiors. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv), "When we humbly give way to another's voice, we overcome ourselves in our own hearts."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first rule whereby all rational wills are regulated: and to this rule one will approaches more than another, according to a divinely appointed order. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who issues a command may be as a second rule to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of this other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who obeys him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A thing may be deemed gratuitous in two ways. On one way on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> itself, because, to wit, one is not bound to do it; in another way, on the part of the doer, because he does it of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is rendered <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, chiefly according as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore although obedience be a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, if one obey with a prompt will, one's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is not for that reason diminished, especially before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who sees not only the outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, but also the inward will.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether obedience is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that obedience is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For disobedience is contrary to obedience. But disobedience is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Parad. viii) that "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to disobey the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>." Therefore obedience is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either theological or moral. But obedience is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is not comprised under <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Nor is it a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it does not hold the mean between excess and deficiency, for the more obedient one is the more is one praised. Therefore obedience is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience is the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and praiseworthy, the less it holds its own." But every special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the more to be praised the more it holds its own, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> requires a man to exercise his will and choice, as stated in Ethic. ii, 4. Therefore obedience is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to their objects. Now the object of obedience would seem to be the command of a superior, of which, apparently, there are as many kinds as there are degrees of superiority. Therefore obedience is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, comprising many special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> obedience is reckoned by some to be a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (<a href="#80">Article 80</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is assigned to all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that have a special reason of praise: for it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to render a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now obedience to a superior is due in accordance with the divinely established order of things, as shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), and therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and order, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Natura Boni iii) [Cf. I, 5, 5]. Again, this act has a special aspect of praiseworthiness by reason of its object. For while subjects have many <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards their superiors, this one, that they are bound to obey their commands, stands out as special among the rest. Wherefore obedience is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and its specific object is a command tacit or express, because the superior's will, however it become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is a tacit precept, and a man's obedience seems to be all the more prompt, forasmuch as by obeying he forestalls the express command as soon as he understands his superior's will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing prevents the one same material object from admitting two special aspects to which two special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> correspond: thus a soldier, by defending his king's fortress, fulfils both an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, by facing the danger of death for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, and an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by rendering due service to his lord. Accordingly the aspect of precept, which obedience considers, occurs in acts of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but not in all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since not all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are a matter of precept, as stated above (I-II, 96, 3). Moreover, certain things are sometimes a matter of precept, and pertain to no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such things for instance as are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> except because they are forbidden. Wherefore, if obedience be taken in its proper sense, as considering formally and intentionally the aspect of precept, it will be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and disobedience a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because in this way it is requisite for obedience that one perform an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or of some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of fulfilling a precept; and for disobedience that one treat the precept with actual contempt. On the other hand, if obedience be taken in a wide sense for the performance of any action that may be a matter of precept, and disobedience for the omission of that action through any <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> whatever, then obedience will be a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and disobedience a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Obedience is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for its direct object is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the precept of any superior, whether expressed or inferred, namely, a simple word of the superior, indicating his will, and which the obedient subject obeys promptly, according to <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse1">Titus 3:1</a>, "Admonish them to be subject to princes, and to obey at a word," etc.

<p>It is, however, a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and it observes the mean between excess and deficiency. Excess thereof is measured in respect, not of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, but of other circumstances, in so far as a man obeys either whom he ought not, or in matters wherein he ought not to obey, as we have stated above regarding religion (92, 2). We may also reply that as in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, excess is in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who retains another's property, and deficiency in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who does not receive his due, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 4), so too obedience observes the mean between excess on the part of him who fails to pay due obedience to his superior, since he exceeds in fulfilling his own will, and deficiency on the part of the superior, who does not receive obedience. Wherefore in this way obedience will be a mean between two forms of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as was stated above concerning <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (58, 10).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Obedience, like every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> requires the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be prompt towards its proper object, but not towards that which is repugnant to it. Now the proper object of obedience is a precept, and this proceeds from another's will. Wherefore obedience make a man's will prompt in fulfilling the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another, the maker, namely, of the precept. If that which is prescribed to him is willed by him for its own sake apart from its being prescribed, as happens in agreeable matters, he tends towards it at once by his own will and seems to comply, not on account of the precept, but on account of his own will. But if that which is prescribed is nowise willed for its own sake, but, considered in itself, repugnant to his own will, as happens in disagreeable matters, then it is quite evident that it is not fulfilled except on account of the precept. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience perishes or diminishes when it holds its own in agreeable matters," because, to wit, one's own will seems to tend principally, not to the accomplishment of the precept, but to the fulfilment of one's own desire; but that "it increases in disagreeable or difficult matters," because there one's own will tends to nothing beside the precept. Yet this must be understood as regards outward appearances: for, on the other hand, according to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who searches the heart, it may happen that even in agreeable matters obedience, while holding its own, is nonetheless praiseworthy, provided the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that obeys tend no less devotedly [Cf. 82, 2] to the fulfilment of the precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Reverence regards directly the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that excels: wherefore it admits a various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> according to the various aspects of excellence. Obedience, on the other hand, regards the precept of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that excels, and therefore admits of only one aspect. And since obedience is due to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> precept on account of reverence to him, it follows that obedience to a man is of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> from which it proceeds differ specifically.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether obedience is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that obedience is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse22">1 Samuel 15:22</a>): "Obedience is better than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>." Now the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> belongs to religion, which is the greatest of all moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as shown above (Question 81, Article 6). Therefore obedience is the greatest of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience is the only <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that ingrafts <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and protects them when ingrafted." Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is greater than the effect. Therefore obedience is greater than all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should never be done out of obedience: yet sometimes for the sake of obedience we should lay aside the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we are doing." Now one does not lay aside a thing except for something better. Therefore obedience, for whose sake the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is set aside, is better than other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> obedience deserves praise because it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience should be practiced, not out of servile fear, but from a sense of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, not through fear of punishment, but through love of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than obedience.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contemning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and adhering to mutable things, so the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contemning <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> goods and adhering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as his end. Now the end is greater than that which is directed to the end. Therefore if a man contemns <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> goods in order that he may adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives greater praise from his adhering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than from his contemning earthly things. And so those, namely the theological, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby he adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, are greater than the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby he holds in contempt some earthly thing in order to adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the greater the thing which a man contemns that he may adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may contemn for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. The lowest of these are external goods, the goods of the body take the middle place, and the highest are the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and among these the chief, in a way, is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as, by his will, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes use of all other goods. Therefore, properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of obedience, whereby we contemn our own will for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, is more praiseworthy than the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which contemn other goods for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience is rightly preferred to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, because by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> another's body is slain whereas by obedience we slay our own will." Wherefore even any other acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through being performed out of obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. For were one to suffer even <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, or to give all one's goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, unless one directed these things to the fulfilment of the divine will, which pertains directly to obedience, they could not be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>: as neither would they be if they were done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> apart from obedience. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse4">1 John 2:4-5</a>): "He who saith that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar . . . but he that keepeth His word, in him in very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is perfected": and this because friends have the same likes and dislikes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Obedience proceeds from reverence, which pays worship and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to a superior, and in this respect it is contained under different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, although considered in itself, as regarding the aspect of precept, it is one special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, in so far as it proceeds from reverence for a superior, it is contained, in a way, under observance; while in so far as it proceeds from reverence for one's parents, it is contained under piety; and in so far as it proceeds from reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it comes under religion, and pertains to devotion, which is the principal act of religion. Wherefore from this point of view it is more praiseworthy to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to offer sacrifice, as well as because, "in a sacrifice we slay another's body, whereas by obedience we slay our own will," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv). As to the special case in which Samuel spoke, it would have been better for Saul to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to offer in sacrifice the fat animals of the Amalekites against the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as they come under a precept, belong to obedience. Wherefore according as acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> act <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causally</a> or dispositively towards their generation and preservation, obedience is said to ingraft and protect all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And yet it does not follow that obedience takes precedence of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> absolutely, for two reasons. First, because though an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> come under a precept, one may nevertheless perform that act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without considering the aspect of precept. Consequently, if there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whose object is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to the precept, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to obedience. Such a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sublime <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of divine authority, by reason of which the power to command is competent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, because infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may precede, even in point of time, all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts: and in this way obedience is not prior to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, neither in point of time nor by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. There is that to which we are bound of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, for instance to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so forth: and by no means may such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be set aside on account of obedience. But there is another <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we ought sometimes to set aside for the sake of obedience to which we are bound of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since we ought not to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> remarks (Moral. xxxv), "he who forbids his subjects any single <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, must needs allow them many others, lest the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who obey perish utterly from starvation, through being deprived of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Thus the loss of one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be compensated by obedience and other goods.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God ought to be obeyed in all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> need not be obeyed in all things. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse30">Matthew 9:30-31</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> after healing the two blind men commanded them, saying: "See that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this. But they going out spread His fame abroad in all that country." Yet they are not blamed for so doing. Therefore it seems that we are not bound to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is bound to do anything contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now we find that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded certain things contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus He commanded <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to slay his innocent son (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm">Genesis 22</a>); and the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to steal the property of the Egyptians (<a href="../bible/exo011.htm">Exodus 11</a>), which things are contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and Osee to take to himself a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was an adulteress (<a href="../bible/hos003.htm">Hosea 3</a>), and this is contrary to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be obeyed in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> conforms his will to the divine will even as to the thing willed. But we are not bound in all things to conform our will to the divine will as to the thing willed, as stated above (I-II, 19, 10). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse7">Exodus 24:7</a>): "All things that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and we will be obedient."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), he who obeys is moved by the command of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he obeys, just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are moved by their motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now just a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first mover of all things that are moved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, so too is He the first mover of all wills, as shown above (I-II, 09, 6). Therefore just as all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are subject to the divine motion by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> so too all wills, by a kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, are bound to obey the divine command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in telling the blind men to conceal the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> had no <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of binding them with the force of a divine precept, but, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xix), "gave an example to His servants who follow Him that they might wish to hide their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and yet that it should be proclaimed against their will, in order that others might profit by their example."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (since "the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does therein," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom011.htm">Romans 11</a>), and yet does certain things contrary to the wonted course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can command nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and rectitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will consist chiefly in conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will and obedience to His command, although it be contrary to the wonted mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Accordingly, then, the command given to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to slay his innocent son was not contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of life an death. Nor again was it contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that He commanded the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to take things belonging to the Egyptians, because all things are His, and He gives them to whom He will. Nor was it contrary to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> that Osee was commanded to take an adulteress, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the ordainer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, and the right manner of intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is that which He appoints. Hence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> aforesaid did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either by obeying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by willing to obey Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not always bound to will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills, yet he is always bound to will what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills him to will. This comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> chiefly through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commands in all things.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether subjects are bound to obey their superiors in all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that subjects are bound to obey their superiors in all things. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse20">Colossians 3:20</a>): "Children, obey your parents in all things," and farther on (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse22">Colossians 3:22</a>): "Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh." Therefore in like manner other subjects are bound to obey their superiors in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, superiors stand between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their subjects, according to <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, "I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that time, to show you His words." Now there is no going from extreme to extreme, except through that which stands between. Therefore the commands of a superior must be esteemed the commands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse14">Galatians 4:14</a>): "You . . . received me as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>" and (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>): "When you had received of us the word of the hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you received it, not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but, as it is indeed, the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things, so is he bound to obey his superiors.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as religious in making their profession take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, so do they also <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> obedience. Now a religious is bound to observe <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> in all things. Therefore he is also bound to obey in all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse29">Acts 5:29</a>): "We ought to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than men." Now sometimes the things commanded by a superior are against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore superiors are not to be obeyed in all things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A1,4), he who obeys is moved at the bidding of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commands him, by a certain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, even as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing is moved through the power of its mover by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. That a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing be not moved by its mover, may happen in two ways. First, on account of a hindrance arising from the stronger power of some other mover; thus wood is not burnt by fire if a stronger force of water intervene. Secondly, through lack of order in the movable with regard to its mover, since, though it is subject to the latter's action in one respect, yet it is not subject thereto in every respect. Thus, a humor is sometimes subject to the action of heat, as regards being heated, but not as regards being dried up or consumed. On like manner there are two reasons, for which a subject may not be bound to obey his superior in all things. First on account of the command of a higher power. For as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans 13:2</a>, "They that resist [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'He that resisteth'] the power, resist the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Verb. Dom. viii). "If a commissioner issue an order, are you to comply, if it is contrary to the bidding of the proconsul? Again if the proconsul command one thing, and the emperor another, will you hesitate, to disregard the former and serve the latter? Therefore if the emperor commands one thing and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> another, you must disregard the former and obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Secondly, a subject is not bound to obey his superior if the latter command him to do something wherein he is not subject to him. For Seneca says (De Beneficiis iii): "It is wrong to suppose that slavery falls upon the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for the better part of him is excepted." His body is subjected and assigned to his master but his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is his own. Consequently in matters touching the internal movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not bound to obey his fellow-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p>Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to obey his fellow-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in things that have to be done externally by means of the body: and yet, since by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are equal, he is not bound to obey another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in matters touching the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, for instance in those relating to the support of his body or the begetting of his children. Wherefore servants are not bound to obey their masters, nor children their parents, in the question of contracting marriage or of remaining in the state of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> or the like. But in matters concerning the disposal of actions and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, a subject is bound to obey his superior within the sphere of his authority; for instance a soldier must obey his general in matters relating to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, a servant his master in matters touching the execution of the duties of his service, a son his father in matters relating to the conduct of his life and the care of the household; and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says "in all things," he refers to matters within the sphere of a father's or master's authority.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply as regards all things, both internal and external, wherefore he is bound to obey Him in all things. On the other hand, inferiors are not subject to their superiors in all things, but only in certain things and in a particular way, in respect of which the superior stands between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his subjects, whereas in respect of other matters the subject is immediately under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whom he is taught either by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or by the written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">Religious</a> profess obedience as to the regular mode of life, in respect of which they are subject to their superiors: wherefore they are bound to obey in those matters only which may belong to the regular mode of life, and this obedience suffices for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. If they be willing to obey even in other matters, this will belong to the superabundance of perfection; provided, however, such things be not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to the rule they profess, for obedience in this case would be unlawful.

<p>Accordingly we may distinguish a threefold obedience; one, sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and consisting in obeying when one is bound to obey: secondly, perfect obedience, which obeys in all things lawful: thirdly, indiscreet obedience, which obeys even in matters unlawful.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether Christians are bound to obey the secular powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not bound to obey the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse25">Matthew 17:25</a>, "Then the children are free," says: "If in every kingdom the children of the king who holds sway over that kingdom are free, then the children of that King, under Whose sway are all kingdoms, should be free in every kingdom." Now <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are made children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John 1:12</a>: "He gave them power to be made the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name." Therefore they are not bound to obey the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse4">Romans 7:4</a>): "You . . . are become dead to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> mentioned here is the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> whereby men are subject to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> is of less account than the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Much more, therefore, since they have become members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, are men freed from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of subjection, whereby they were under the power of secular princes.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, men are not bound to obey robbers, who oppress them with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei iv): "Without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, what else is a kingdom but a huge robbery?" Since therefore the authority of secular princes is frequently exercised with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, or owes its origin to some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> usurpation, it seems that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought not to obey secular princes.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse1">Titus 3:1</a>): "Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers," and (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse13">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>): "Be ye subject . . . to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake: whether it be to the king as excelling, or to governors as sent by him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the origin and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>:" wherefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not void the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but strengthens it." Now the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires that subjects obey their superiors, else the stability of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs would cease. Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not excuse the faithful from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of obeying secular princes.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), subjection whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to another regards the body; not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which retains its liberty. Now, in this state of life we are freed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from defects of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but not from defects of the body, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares by saying of himself (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans 7:23</a>) that in his mind he served the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in his flesh the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore those that are made children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are free from the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not from the bodily bondage, whereby they are held bound to earthly masters, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>, "Whosoever are servants under the yoke," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and therefore it had to cease on the advent of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the comparison with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not stand because thereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to another. Yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> to obey his fellow-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is bound to obey secular princes in so far as this is required by order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore if the prince's authority is not just but usurped, or if he commands what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, his subjects are not bound to obey him, except perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or danger.
