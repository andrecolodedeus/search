<h1>Question 104. The special effects of the divine government</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1104.htm#article1"> Do creatures need to be kept in existence by God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1104.htm#article2"> Are they immediately preserved by God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1104.htm#article3"> Can God reduce anything to nothingness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1104.htm#article4"> Is anything reduced to nothingness?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether creatures need to be kept in being by God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that creatures do not need to be kept in being by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what cannot not-be, does not need to be kept in being; just as that which cannot depart, does not need to be kept from departing. But some creatures by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot not-be. Therefore not all creatures need to be kept in being by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The middle proposition is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. That which is included in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> in that thing, and its contrary cannot be in it; thus a multiple of two must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be even, and cannot possibly be an odd number. Now form brings being with itself, because everything is actually in being, so far as it has form. But some creatures are subsistent forms, as we have said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (50, 2,5): and thus to be is in them of themselves. The same reasoning applies to those creatures whose <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to one form only, as above explained of heavenly bodies (66, 2). Therefore such creatures as these have in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, and cannot not-be; for there can be no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to not-being, either in the form which has being of itself, or in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> under a form which it cannot lose, since it is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to any other form.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more powerful than any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent. But a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent, even after ceasing to act, can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> its effect to be preserved in being; thus the house continues to stand after the builder has ceased to build; and water remains hot for some time after the fire has ceased to heat. Much more, therefore, can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> His creature to be kept in being, after He has ceased to create it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> can occur, except there be some active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof. But tendency to not-being is unnatural and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> to any creature, since all creatures <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire to be. Therefore no creature can tend to not-being, except through some active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of corruption. Now there are creatures of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that nothing can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to corrupt; such are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> and heavenly bodies. Therefore such creatures cannot tend to not-being, even if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to withdraw His action.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> keeps creatures in being, this is done by some action. Now every action of an agent, if that action be efficacious, produces something in the effect. Therefore the preserving power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must produce something in the creature. But this is not so; because this action does not give being to the creature, since being is not given to that which already is: nor does it add anything new to the creature; because either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not keep the creature in being continually, or He would be continually adding something new to the creature; either of which is unreasonable. Therefore creatures are not kept in being by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>): "Upholding all things by the word of His power."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Both reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> bind us to say that creatures are kept in being by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To make this clear, we must consider that a thing is preserved by another in two ways.

<p>First, indirectly, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; thus a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to preserve anything by removing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its corruption, as a man may be said to preserve a child, whom he guards from falling into the fire. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves some things, but not all, for there are some things of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that nothing can corrupt them, so that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to keep them from corruption.

<p>Secondly, a thing is said to preserve another 'per se' and directly, namely, when what is preserved depends on the preserver in such a way that it cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without it. In this manner all creatures need to be preserved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the being of every creature depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that not for a moment could it subsist, but would fall into nothingness were it not kept in being by the operation of the Divine power, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xvi).

<p>This is made clear as follows: Every effect depends on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so far as it is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But we must observe that an agent may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the "becoming" of its effect, but not directly of its "being." This may be seen both in artificial and in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> beings: for the builder <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the house in its "becoming," but he is not the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its "being." For it is clear that the "being" of the house is a result of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which consists in the putting together and arrangement of the materials, and results from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of certain things. Thus a cook dresses the food by applying the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> activity of fire; thus a builder constructs a house, by making use of cement, stones, and wood which are able to be put together in a certain order and to preserve it. Therefore the "being" of a house depends on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these materials, just as its "becoming" depends on the action of the builder. The same principle applies to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. For if an agent is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a form as such, neither will it be directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of "being" which results from that form; but it will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect, in its "becoming" only.

<p>Now it is clear that of two things in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> one cannot directly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the other's form as such, since it would then be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its own form, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same as the form of the other; but it can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this form for as much as it is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>--in other words, it may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that "this matter" receives "this form." And this is to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of "becoming," as when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begets <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fire <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fire. Thus whenever a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effect is such that it has an aptitude to receive from its active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an impression specifically the same as in that active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then the "becoming" of the effect, but not its "being," depends on the agent.

<p>Sometimes, however, the effect has not this aptitude to receive the impression of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in the same way as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the agent: as may be seen clearly in all agents which do not produce an effect of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as themselves: thus the heavenly bodies <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the generation of inferior bodies which differ from them in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Such an agent can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a form as such, and not merely as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in this matter, consequently it is not merely the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of "becoming" but also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of "being."

<p>Therefore as the becoming of a thing cannot continue when that action of the agent ceases which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the "becoming" of the effect: so neither can the "being" of a thing continue after that action of the agent has ceased, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the effect not only in "becoming" but also in "being." This is why hot water retains heat after the cessation of the fire's action; while, on the contrary, the air does not continue to be lit up, even for a moment, when the sun ceases to act upon it, because water is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> susceptive of the fire's heat in the same way as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the fire. Wherefore if it were to be reduced to the perfect form of fire, it would retain that form always; whereas if it has the form of fire imperfectly and inchoately, the heat will remain for a time only, by reason of the imperfect participation of the principle of heat. On the other hand, air is not of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to receive light in the same way as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the sun, which is the principle of light. Therefore, since it has not root in the air, the light ceases with the action of the sun.

<p>Now every creature may be compared to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the air is to the sun which enlightens it. For as the sun possesses light by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and as the air is enlightened by sharing the sun's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is Being in virtue of His own Essence, since His Essence is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; whereas every creature has being by participation, so that its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 12): "If the ruling power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were withdrawn from His creatures, their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would at once cease, and all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would collapse." In the same work (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) he says: "As the air becomes light by the presence of the sun, so is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enlightened by the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in His absence returns at once to darkness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Being" <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> results from the form of a creature, given the influence of the Divine action; just as light results from the diaphanous <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the air, given the action of the sun. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to not-being in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creatures and heavenly bodies is rather something in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who can withdraw His influence, than in the form or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of those creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot grant to a creature to be preserved in being after the cessation of the Divine influence: as neither can He make it not to have received its being from Himself. For the creature needs to be preserved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as the being of an effect depends on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its being. So that there is no comparison with an agent that is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of 'being' but only of "becoming."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument holds in regard to that preservation which consists in the removal of corruption: but all creatures do not need to be preserved thus, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The preservation of things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a continuation of that action whereby He gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which action is without either motion or time; so also the preservation of light in the air is by the continual influence of the sun.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God preserves every creature immediately?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves every creature immediately. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates and preserves things by the same action, as above stated (1, ad 4). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things immediately. Therefore He preserves all things immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is nearer to itself than to another. But it cannot be given to a creature to preserve itself; much less therefore can it be given to a creature to preserve another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves all things without any intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> preserving them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an effect is kept in being by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not only of its "becoming," but also of its being. But all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not seem to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> their effects except in their "becoming," for they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only by moving, as above stated (45, 3). Therefore they do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> so as to keep their effects in being.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A thing is kept in being by that which gives it being. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives being by means of certain intermediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore He also keeps things in being by means of certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), a thing keeps another in being in two ways; first, indirectly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, by removing or hindering the action of a corrupting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; secondly, directly and "per se," by the fact that that on it depends the other's being, as the being of the effect depends on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. And in both ways a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing keeps another in being. For it is clear that even in corporeal things there are many <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which hinder the action of corrupting agents, and for that reason are called preservatives; just as salt preserves meat from putrefaction; and in like manner with many other things. It happens also that an effect depends on a creature as to its being. For when we have a series of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> depending on one another, it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that, while the effect depends first and principally on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it also depends in a secondary way on all the middle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the preservation of the effect which is to be referred to the middle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in a secondary way; and all the more so, as the middle <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is higher and nearer to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>For this reason, even in things corporeal, the preservation and continuation of things is ascribed to the higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 6), that the first, namely the diurnal movement is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the continuation of things generated; whereas the second movement, which is from the zodiac, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of diversity owing to generation and corruption. In like manner astrologers ascribe to Saturn, the highest of the planets, those things which are permanent and fixed. So we conclude that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> keeps certain things in being, by means of certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things immediately, but in the creation itself He established an order among things, so that some depend on others, by which they are preserved in being, though He remains the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their preservation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since an effect is preserved by its proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on which it depends; just as no effect can be its own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but can only produce another effect, so no effect can be endowed with the power of self-preservation, but only with the power of preserving another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, as regards the latter acquiring a new form, or disposition, except by virtue of some change; for the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> acts always on something presupposed. But after <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> the form or disposition in the effect, without any fresh change in the effect, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> preserves that form or disposition; as in the air, when it is lit up anew, we must allow some change to have taken place, while the preservation of the light is without any further change in the air due to the presence of the source of light.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God can annihilate anything?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot annihilate anything. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 21) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anything tending to non-existence." But He would be such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> if He were to annihilate anything. Therefore He cannot annihilate anything.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32): "Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, we <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot cease to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore He cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> things to cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; which would be the case were He to annihilate anything.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to annihilate anything it would be by His action. But this cannot be; because the term of every action is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Hence even the action of a corrupting <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has its term in something generated; for when one thing is generated another undergoes corruption. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot annihilate anything.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 10:24</a>): "Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgment; and not in Thy fury, lest Thou bring me to nothing."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in giving <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to creatures, acted from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Were this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could not annihilate anything, since His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot change. But, as we have said above (Question 19, Article 4), such an opinion is entirely <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and absolutely contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which confesses that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa134.htm#verse6">Psalm 134:6</a>: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, He hath done." Therefore that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to a creature depends on His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; nor does He preserve things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> otherwise than by continually pouring out <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into them, as we have said. Therefore, just as before things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was free not to give them <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and not to make them; so after they are made, He is free not to continue their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and thus they would cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; and this would be to annihilate them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> has no direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for nothing is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> except inasmuch as it has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and a being <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> as such is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a thing to tend to non-existence, whereas a creature has this tendency of itself, since it is produced from nothing. But indirectly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things being reduced to non-existence, by withdrawing His action therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, not as though by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, because the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> does not depend on creatures; but by His <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Wherefore, as without prejudice to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, He might not have produced things into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, so, without prejudice to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, He might not preserve things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to annihilate anything, this would not imply an action on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part; but a mere cessation of His action.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether anything is annihilated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that something is annihilated. For the end corresponds to the beginning. But in the beginning there was nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore all things must tend to this end, that there shall be nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore creatures will be reduced to nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every creature has a finite power. But no finite power extends to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 10) that, "a finite power cannot move in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time." Therefore a creature cannot last for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> duration; and so at some time it will be reduced to nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, forms and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> have no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as part of themselves. But at some time they cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Therefore they are reduced to nothing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>): "I have learned that all the works that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made continue for ever."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some of those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does in creatures occur in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course of things; others happen <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, and not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, as will be explained (105, 6). Now whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to do according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of things may be observed from their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but those things which occur <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, are ordered for the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, "To each one is given the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, unto profit" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>); and subsequently he mentions, among others, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of creatures shows that none of them is annihilated. For, either they are immaterial, and therefore have no <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to non-existence; or they are material, and then they continue to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, at least in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is incorruptible, since it is the subject of generation and corruption. Moreover, the annihilation of things does not pertain to the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since rather the power and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are manifested by the preservation of things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Wherefore we must conclude by denying absolutely that anything at all will be annihilated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That things are brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from a state of non-existence, clearly shows the power of Him Who made them; but that they should be reduced to nothing would hinder that manifestation, since the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is conspicuously shown in His preserving all things in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>: "Upholding all things by the word of His power" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A creature's <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is merely receptive; the active power belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, from Whom <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is derived. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> duration of things is a consequence of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the Divine power. To some things, however, is given a determinate power of duration for a certain time, so far as they may be hindered by some contrary agent from receiving the influx of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which comes from Him Whom finite power cannot resist, for an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but only for a fixed time. So things which have no contrary, although they have a finite power, continue to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> for ever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Forms and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are not complete beings, since they do not subsist: but each one of them is something "of a being"; for it is called a being, because something is by it. Yet so far as their mode of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is concerned, they are not entirely reduced to nothingness; not that any part of them survives, but that they remain in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or of the subject.
