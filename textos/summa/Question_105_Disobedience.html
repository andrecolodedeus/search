<h1>Question 105. Disobedience</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3105.htm#article1"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3105.htm#article2"> Is it the most grievous of sins?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether disobedience is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that disobedience is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disobedience, as appears from <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose's</a> definition given above (104, 2, Objection 1). Therefore if disobedience were a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be mortal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi) that disobedience is born of vainglory. But vainglory is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither therefore is disobedience.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be disobedient when he does not fulfil a superior's command. But superiors often issue so many commands that it is seldom, if ever, possible to fulfil them. Therefore if disobedience were a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot avoid mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is absurd. Wherefore disobedience is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of disobedience to parents is reckoned (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse2">Romans 1:30</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse2">2 Timothy 3:2</a>) among other mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (24, 12; I-II, 72, 5; I-II, 88, 1), a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life. Now by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> we love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires that we obey His commandments, as stated above (Question 24, Article 12). Therefore to be disobedient to the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Again, the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contain the precept of obedience to superiors. Wherefore also disobedience to the commands of a superior is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as being contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans 13:2</a>, "He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." It is also contrary to the love of our neighbor, as it withdraws from the superior who is our neighbor the obedience that is his due.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The definition given by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> refers to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has the character of perfect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not disobedience, because it is not contrary to a precept, but beside it. Nor again is every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> disobedience, properly and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but only when one contemns a precept, since moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the end. And when a thing is done contrary to a precept, not in contempt of the precept, but with some other purpose, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of disobedience except materially, and belongs formally to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Vainglory desires display of excellence. And since it seems to point to a certain excellence that one be not subject to another's command, it follows that disobedience arises from vainglory. But there is nothing to hinder mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from arising out of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disposition to mortal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No one is bound to do the impossible: wherefore if a superior makes a heap of precepts and lays them upon his subjects, so that they are unable to fulfil them, they are excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore superiors should refrain from making a multitude of precepts.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether disobedience is the most grievous of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that disobedience is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse23">1 Samuel 15:23</a>): "It is like the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of witchcraft to rebel, and like the crime of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to refuse to obey." But <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (Question 94, Article 3). Therefore disobedience is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is one that removes the obstacles of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 14, Article 2). Now disobedience makes a man contemn a precept which, more than anything, prevents a man from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Therefore disobedience is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and consequently is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans 5:19</a>) that "by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, many were made sinners." Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is seemingly greater than its effect. Therefore disobedience seems to be a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the others that are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> thereby.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contempt of the commander is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than contempt of his command. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are against the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the commander, such as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Therefore disobedience is not the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Not every disobedience is equally a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for one disobedience may be greater than another, in two ways. First, on the part of the superior commanding, since, although a man should take every care to obey each superior, yet it is a greater <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to obey a higher than a lower authority, in sign of which the command of a lower authority is set aside if it be contrary to the command of a higher authority. Consequently the higher the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commands, the more grievous is it to disobey him: so that it is more grievous to disobey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, on the part of the things commanded. For the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commanding does not equally desire the fulfilment of all his commands: since every such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> desires above all the end, and that which is nearest to the end. Wherefore disobedience is the more grievous, according as the unfulfilled commandment is more in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commanding. As to the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is evident that the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> commanded, the more grievous the disobedience of that commandment, because since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the more does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wish it to be fulfilled. Consequently he that disobeys the commandment of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than one who disobeys the commandment of the love of our neighbor. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not always directed to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: hence, when we are bound by a mere precept of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous, not through setting aside a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but through setting aside that which is more in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commanding.

<p>Accordingly the various degrees of disobedience must correspond with the various degrees of precepts: because the disobedience in which there is contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> precept, from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of disobedience is more grievous than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against a man, apart from the latter being a disobedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I say this because whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his neighbor acts also against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment. And if the divine precept be contemned in a yet graver <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is still more grievous. The disobedience that contains contempt of a man's precept is less grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which contemns the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who made the precept, because reverence for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commanding should give rise to reverence for his command. On like manner a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that directly involves contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, or the like, is more grievous (even if we <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> separate the disobedience from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) than would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involving contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This comparison of Samuel is one, not of equality but of likeness, because disobedience redounds to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> just as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> does, though the latter does so more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not every disobedience is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but only that which obstinacy is added: for it is not the contempt of any obstacle to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that constitutes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, else the contempt of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may hinder a man from committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> consists in the contempt of those goods which lead directly to repentance and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was transmitted to a men, was not disobedience considered as a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, from which then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proceeded to disobey. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> in these words seems to take disobedience in its relation to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
