<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God can move the matter immediately to the form?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> immediately to receive the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 8), nothing can bring a form into any particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, except that form which is in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; because, like begets like. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore He cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, any agent inclined to several effects will produce none of them, unless it is determined to a particular one by some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 11), a general assertion does not move the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, except by means of some particular apprehension. But the Divine power is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. Therefore it cannot produce any particular form, except by means of a particular agent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> As universal being depends on the first universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so determinate being depends on determinate particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; as we have seen above (Question 104, Article 2). But the determinate being of a particular thing is from its own form. Therefore the forms of things are produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only by means of particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis 2:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the slime of the earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can move <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> immediately to form; because whatever is in passive <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> can be reduced to act by the active power which extends over that <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Therefore, since the Divine power extends over <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it can be reduced to act by the Divine power: and this is what is meant by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> being moved to a form; for a form is nothing else but the act of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An effect is assimilated to the active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in two ways.

<p>First, according to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is generated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fire by fire.

<p>Secondly, by being virtually contained in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as the form of the effect is virtually contained in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus animals produced by putrefaction, and plants, and minerals are like the sun and stars, by whose power they are produced. In this way the effect is like its active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as regards all that over which the power of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> extends. Now the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> extends to both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; as we have said above (14, 2; 44, 2); wherefore if a composite thing be produced, it is likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of a virtual inclusion; or it is likened to the composite generator by a likeness of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore just as the composite generator can move <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to a form by generating a composite thing like itself; so also can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But no other form not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can do this; because the power of no other separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> extends over <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> operate on visible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; not by imprinting forms in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but by making use of corporeal seeds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument would hold if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were to act of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But since He acts by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the particular and not only the universal natures of all forms, it follows that He can determinately imprint this or that form on <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are ordered to determinate effects is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordains other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to certain effects He can also produce certain effects by Himself without any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God can move a body immediately?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move a body immediately. For as the mover and the moved must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> simultaneously, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vii, 2), it follows that there must be some contact between the mover and moved. But there can be no contact between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and a body; for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. 1): "There is no contact with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move a body immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the mover unmoved. But such also is the desirable object when apprehended. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves as the object of desire and apprehension. But He cannot be apprehended except by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is neither a body nor a corporeal power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move a body immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 10) that an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power moves instantaneously. But it is impossible for a body to be moved in one instant; for since every movement is between opposites, it follows that two opposites would <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at once in the same subject, which is impossible. Therefore a body cannot be moved immediately by an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as we have explained (25, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move a body immediately.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produced the works of the six days immediately among which is included the movements of bodies, as is clear from <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse9">Genesis 1:9</a> "Let the waters be gathered together into one place." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can move a body immediately.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot Himself produce all the determinate effects which are produced by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore, since bodies are moved immediately by <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, we cannot possibly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can move immediately any bodies whatever. This indeed follows from what is above stated (1). For every movement of any body whatever, either results from a form, as the movements of things heavy and light result from the form which they have from their generating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for which reason the generator is called the mover; or else tends to a form, as heating tends to the form of heat. Now it belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to imprint a form, to dispose to that form, and to give the movement which results from that form; for fire not only generates fire, but it also heats and moves things upwards. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can imprint form immediately in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it follows that He can move any body whatever in respect of any movement whatever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are two kinds of contact; corporeal contact, when two bodies touch each other; and virtual contact, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sadness is said to touch the one made sad. According to the first kind of contact, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being incorporeal, neither touches, nor is touched; but according to virtual contact He touches creatures by moving them; but He is not touched, because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of no creature can reach up to Him. Thus did <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> understand the words, "There is no contact with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; that is, so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself be touched.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves as the object of desire and apprehension; but it does not follow that He always moves as being desired and apprehended by that which is moved; but as being desired and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Himself; for He does all things for His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 10) intends to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the power of the first mover is not a power of the first mover "of bulk," by the following argument. The power of the first mover is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> (which he proves from the fact that the first mover can move in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> time). Now an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, if it were a power "of bulk," would move without time, which is impossible; therefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power of the first mover must be in something which is not measured by its bulk. Whence it is clear that for a body to be moved without time can only be the result of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. The reason is that every power of bulk moves in its entirety; since it moves by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power surpasses out of all proportion any finite power. Now the greater the power of the mover, the greater is the velocity of the movement. Therefore, since a finite power moves in a determinate time, it follows that an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power does not move in any time; for between one time and any other time there is some proportion. On the other hand, a power which is not in bulk is the power of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being, which operates in its effects according to what is fitting to them; and therefore, since it cannot be fitting for a body to be moved without time, it does not follow that it moves without time.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God moves the created intellect immediately?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not immediately move the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is governed by its own subject; since it does not pass into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as stated in Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8. But the action of what is moved by another does not proceed from that wherein it is; but from the mover. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not moved by another; and so apparently <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, anything which in itself is a sufficient principle of movement, is not moved by another. But the movement of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is its act of understanding; in the sense in which we say that to understand or to feel is a kind of movement, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 7). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is a sufficient principle of understanding. Therefore it is not moved by another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the senses are moved by the sensible, so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the intelligible. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not intelligible to us, and exceeds the capacity of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The teacher moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the one taught. But it is written (<a href="../bible/psa093.htm#verse10">Psalm 93:10</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "teaches <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As in corporeal movement that is called the mover which gives the form that is the principle of movement, so that is said to move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the form that is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation, called the movement of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now there is a twofold principle of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being; one which is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power itself, which principle <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the one who understands in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; while the other is the principle of actual understanding, namely, the likeness of the thing understood in the one who understands. So a thing is said to move the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whether it gives to him who understands the power of understanding; or impresses on him the likeness of the thing understood.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in both ways. For He is the First immaterial Being; and as intellectuality is a result of immateriality, it follows that He is the First <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> Being. Therefore since in each order the first is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all that follows, we must conclude that from Him proceeds all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. In like manner, since He is the First Being, and all other beings pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him as in their First Cause, it follows that they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> intelligibly in Him, after the mode of His own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. For as the intelligible types of everything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> first of all in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are derived from Him by other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> in order that these may actually understand; so also are they derived by creatures that they may subsist. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so moves the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, inasmuch as He gives it the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, whether <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, or superadded; and impresses on the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and maintains and preserves both power and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation is performed by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in which it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, as by a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from its first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For by Him the power to understand is given to the one who understands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light together with the likeness of the thing understood is a sufficient principle of understanding; but it is a secondary principle, and depends upon the First Principle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The intelligible object moves our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so far as, in a way, it impresses on it its own likeness, by means of which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is able to understand it. But the likenesses which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> impresses on the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are not sufficient to enable the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand Him through His Essence, as we have seen above (12, 2; 56, 3). Hence He moves the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and yet He cannot be intelligible to it, as we have explained (12, 4).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether God can move the created will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> will. For whatever is moved from without, is forced. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be forced. Therefore it is not moved from without; and therefore cannot be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot make two contradictories to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time. But this would follow if He moved the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> moved means to be moved from within, and not by another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, movement is attributed to the mover rather than to the one moved; wherefore homicide is not ascribed to the stone, but to the thrower. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> actions are not imputed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for reward or blame. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians 2:13</a>): "It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who worketh in us [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>--'you'] both to will and to accomplish."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the object and by the Giver of the power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), so is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moved by its object, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and by Him who creates the power of willing. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be moved by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as its object, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone sufficiently and efficaciously. For nothing can move a movable thing sufficiently unless the active power of the mover surpasses or at least equals the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the thing movable. Now the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> extends to the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for its object is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; just as the object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the universal being. But every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Whereas He alone fills the capacity of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and moves it sufficiently as its object. In like manner the power of willing is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For to <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is nothing but to be inclined towards the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But to incline towards the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> belongs to the First Mover, to Whom the ultimate end is proportionate; just as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs to him that presides over the community belongs the directing of his subjects to the common weal. Wherefore in both ways it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but especially in the second way by an interior inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing moved by another is forced if moved against its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination; but if it is moved by another giving to it the proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, it is not forced; as when a heavy body is made to move downwards by that which produced it, then it is not forced. In like manner <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while moving the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, does not force it, because He gives the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To be moved <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, is to be moved from within, that is, by an interior principle: yet this interior principle may be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an exterior principle; and so to be moved from within is not repugnant to being moved by another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> were so moved by another as in no way to be moved from within itself, the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> would not be imputed for reward or blame. But since its being moved by another does not prevent its being moved from within itself, as we have stated (ad 2), it does not thereby forfeit the motive for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God works in every agent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not work in every agent. For we must not attribute any insufficiency to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in every agent, He works sufficiently in each one. Hence it would be superfluous for the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agent to work at all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same work cannot proceed at the same time from two sources; as neither can one and the same movement belong to two movable things. Therefore if the creature's operation is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> operating in the creature, it cannot at the same time proceed from the creature; and so no creature works at all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the maker is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the operation of the thing made, as giving it the form whereby it operates. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the operation of things made by Him, this would be inasmuch as He gives them the power of operating. But this is in the beginning, when He makes them. Thus it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not operate any further in the operating creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse12">Isaiah 26:12</a>): "Lord, Thou hast wrought all our works in [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'for'] us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have understood <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to work in every agent in such a way that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> power has any effect in things, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the ultimate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of everything wrought; for instance, that it is not fire that gives heat, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the fire, and so forth. But this is impossible.

<p>First, because the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect would be taken away from <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things: and this would imply lack of power in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>: for it is due to the power of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that it bestows active power on its effect.

<p>Secondly, because the active powers which are seen to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in things, would be bestowed on things to no purpose, if these wrought nothing through them. Indeed, all things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> would seem, in a way, to be purposeless, if they lacked an operation proper to them; since the purpose of everything is its operation. For the less perfect is always for the sake of the more perfect: and consequently as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is for the sake of the form, so the form which is the first act, is for the sake of its operation, which is the second act; and thus operation is the end of the creature. We must therefore understand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in things in such a manner that things have their proper operation.

<p>In order to make this clear, we must observe that as there are few kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not a principle of action, but is the subject that receives the effect of action. On the other hand, the end, the agent, and the form are principles of action, but in a certain order. For the first principle of action is the end which moves the agent; the second is the agent; the third is the form of that which the agent applies to action (although the agent also acts through its own form); as may be clearly seen in things made by art. For the craftsman is moved to action by the end, which is the thing wrought, for instance a chest or a bed; and applies to action the axe which cuts through its being sharp.

<p>Thus then does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> work in every worker, according to these three things.

<p>First as an end. For since every operation is for the sake of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, real or apparent; and nothing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> either really or apparently, except in as far as it participates in a likeness to the Supreme Good, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every operation as its end.

<p>Again it is to be observed that where there are several agents in order, the second always acts in virtue of the first; for the first agent moves the second to act. And thus all agents act in virtue of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: and therefore He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of action in every agent.

<p>Thirdly, we must observe that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only moves things to operated, as it were applying their forms and powers to operation, just as the workman applies the axe to cut, who nevertheless at times does not give the axe its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; but He also gives <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> agents their forms and preserves them in being. Therefore He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of action not only by giving the form which is the principle of action, as the generator is said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement in things heavy and light; but also as preserving the forms and powers of things; just as the sun is said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the manifestation of colors, inasmuch as it gives and preserves the light by which colors are made manifest. And since the form of a thing is within the thing, and all the more, as it approaches nearer to the First and Universal Cause; and because in all things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is properly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of universal being which is innermost in all things; it follows that in all things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works intimately. For this reason in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> the operations of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as operating in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job010.htm#verse11">Job 10:11</a>: "Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh: Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works sufficiently in things as First Agent, but it does not follow from this that the operation of secondary agents is superfluous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One action does not proceed from two agents of the same order. But nothing hinders the same action from proceeding from a primary and a secondary agent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only gives things their form, but He also preserves them in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and applies them to act, and is moreover the end of every action, as above explained.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether God can do anything outside the established order of nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything outside the established order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3) says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Maker and Creator of each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, does nothing against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But that which is outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order seems to be against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do nothing outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything outside the order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; for then He would do something <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Therefore He cannot do anything outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> established the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does anything outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would seem that He is changeable; which cannot be said.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes does things which are contrary to the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From each <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> there results a certain order to its effects, since every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is a principle; and so, according to the multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, there results a multiplicity of orders, subjected one to the other, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is subjected to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not subjected to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a lower order; but conversely. An example of this may be seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. On the father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> depends the order of the household; which order is contained in the order of the city; which order again depends on the ruler of the city; while this last order depends on that of the king, by whom the whole kingdom is ordered.

<p>If therefore we consider the order of things depending on the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot do anything against this order; for, if He did so, He would act against His foreknowledge, or His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, or His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. But if we consider the order of things depending on any secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do something outside such order; for He is not subject to the order of secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; but, on the contrary, this order is subject to Him, as proceeding from Him, not by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but by the choice of His own will; for He could have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> another order of things. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do something outside this order <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him, when He chooses, for instance by producing the effects of secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> without them, or by producing certain effects to which secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> do not extend. So <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts against the wonted course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by no means does He act against the supreme <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; because He does not act against Himself."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things something may happen outside this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, in two ways. It may happen by the action of an agent which did not give them their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination; as, for example, when a man moves a heavy body upwards, which does not owe to him its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to move downwards; and that would be against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It may also happen by the action of the agent on whom the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination depends; and this is not against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is clear in the ebb and flow of the tide, which is not against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; although it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of water in a downward direction; for it is owing to the influence of a heavenly body, on which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination of lower bodies depends. Therefore since the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is given to things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if He does anything outside this order, it is not against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "That is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to each thing which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by Him from Whom is all mode, number, and order in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> arises by relation to the First Cause, Who is the rule of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do nothing against such order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fixed a certain order in things in such a way that at the same time He reserved to Himself whatever he intended to do otherwise than by a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. So when He acts outside this order, He does not change.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether whatever God does outside the natural order is miraculous?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not everything which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of things, is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. For the creation of the world, and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the justification of the unrighteous, are done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order; as not being accomplished by the action of any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Yet these things are not called <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Therefore not everything that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is "something difficult, which seldom occurs, surpassing the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and going so far beyond our hopes as to compel our astonishment" [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De utilitate credendi xvi.]. But some things outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are not arduous; for they occur in small things, such as the recovery and healing of the sick. Nor are they of rare occurrence, since they happen frequently; as when the sick were placed in the streets, to be healed by the shadow of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts 5:15</a>). Nor do they surpass the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as when people are cured of a fever. Nor are they beyond our hopes, since we all hope for the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, which nevertheless will be outside the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore not all things are outside the course of natur are <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the word <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is derived from admiration. Now admiration concerns things manifest to the senses. But sometimes things happen outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which are not manifest to the senses; as when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a> were endowed with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without studying or being taught. Therefore not everything that occurs outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "Where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does anything against that order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and are accustomed to observe, we call it a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is derived from admiration, which arises when an effect is manifest, whereas its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is hidden; as when a man sees an eclipse without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the beginning of his Metaphysics. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a manifest effect may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to one, but unknown to others. Wherefore a thing is wonderful to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not at all to others: as an eclipse is to a rustic, but not to an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is so called as being full of wonder; as having a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> absolutely hidden from all: and this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does outside those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, are called <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a>, and the justification of the unrighteous, though done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, are not, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, because they are not of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to proceed from any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; so they do not occur outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since they do not belong to that order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An arduous thing is called a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, not on account of the excellence of the thing wherein it is done, but because it surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: likewise a thing is called unusual, not because it does not often happen, but because it is outside the usual <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> course of things. Furthermore, a thing is said to be above the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing done, but also on account of the manner and order in which it is done. Again, a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is said to go beyond the hope "of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," not above the hope "of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," which hope comes from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">future resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a>, although not manifest in itself, yet was made manifest in its effect, from which it was shown to be wonderful.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether one miracle is greater than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is not greater than another. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Epist. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "In <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, the whole measure of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is the power of the doer." But by the same power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are done. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is not greater than another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> exceeds the finite beyond all proportion; and therefore no more reason <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> to wonder at one effect thereof than at another. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is not greater than another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Lord says, speaking of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>): "The works that I do, he also shall do, and greater than these shall he do."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing is called a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by comparison with the Divine Power; because no action is of any account compared with the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah 40:15</a>: "Behold the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are as a drop from a bucket, and are counted as the smallest grain of a balance." But a thing is called a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by comparison with the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which it surpasses. So the more the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is surpassed, the greater the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Now the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is surpassed in three ways: firstly, in the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, for instance, if two bodies occupy the same place, or if the sun goes backwards; or if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is glorified: such things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is absolutely unable to do; and these hold the highest rank among <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>Secondly, a thing surpasses the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, but in that wherein it is done; as the raising of the dead, and giving sight to the blind, and the like; for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can give life, but not to the dead; and such hold the second rank in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>Thirdly, a thing surpasses <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> power in the measure and order in which it is done; as when a man is cured of a fever suddenly, without treatment or the usual process of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; or as when the air is suddenly condensed into rain, by Divine power without a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as occurred at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Samuel and Elias; and these hold the lowest place in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Moreover, each of these kinds has various degrees, according to the different ways in which the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is surpassed.

<p>From this is clear how to reply to the objections, arguing as they do from the Divine power.
