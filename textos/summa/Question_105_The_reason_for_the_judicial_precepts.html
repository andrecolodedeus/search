<h1>Question 105. The reason for the judicial precepts</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2105.htm#article1"> The reason for the judicial precepts relating to the rulers</a> <li><a href="../summa/2105.htm#article2"> The fellowship of one man with another</a> <li><a href="../summa/2105.htm#article3"> Matters relating to foreigners</a> <li><a href="../summa/2105.htm#article4"> Things relating to domestic matters</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Old Law enjoined fitting precepts concerning rulers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> made unfitting precepts concerning rulers. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 4), "the ordering of the people depends mostly on the chief ruler." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contains no precept relating to the institution of the chief ruler; and yet we find therein prescriptions concerning the inferior rulers: firstly (<a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse21">Exodus 18:21</a>): "Provide out of all the people wise [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'able'] men," etc.; again (<a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse16">Numbers 11:16</a>): "Gather unto Me seventy men of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>"; and again (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>): "Let Me have from among you wise and understanding men," etc. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> provided insufficiently in regard to the rulers of the people.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The best gives of the best," as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> states (Tim. ii). Now the best ordering of a state or of any nation is to be ruled by a king: because this kind of government approaches nearest in resemblance to the Divine government, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rules the world from the beginning. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should have set a king over the people, and they should not have been allowed a choice in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as indeed they were allowed (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 17:14-15</a>): "When thou . . . shalt say: I will set a king over me . . . thou shalt set him," etc.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew 12:25</a>: "Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate": a saying which was verified in the Jewish people, whose destruction was brought about by the division of the kingdom. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should aim chiefly at things pertaining to the general well-being of the people. Therefore it should have forbidden the kingdom to be divided under two kings: nor should this have been introduced even by Divine authority; as we read of its being introduced by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ahias the Silonite (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse29">1 Kings 11:29, seqq.</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are instituted for the benefit of the people in things concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse1">Hebrews 5:1</a>; so are rulers set up for the benefit of the people in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. But certain things were allotted as a means of livelihood for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and Levites of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: such as the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and first-fruits, and many like things. Therefore in like manner certain things should have been determined for the livelihood of the rulers of the people: the more that they were forbidden to accept presents, as is clearly stated in <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse8">Exodus 23:8</a>: "You shall not [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Neither shalt thou'] take bribes, which even blind the wise, and pervert the words of the just."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as a kingdom is the best form of government, so is tyranny the most corrupt. But when the Lord appointed the king, He established a tyrannical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#verse11">1 Samuel 8:11</a>): "This will be the right of the king, that shall reign over you: He will take your sons," etc. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made unfitting provision with regard to the institution of rulers.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is commended for the beauty of its order (<a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse5">Numbers 24:5</a>): "How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and thy tents." But the beautiful ordering of a people depends on the right establishment of its rulers. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made right provision for the people with regard to its rulers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two points are to be observed concerning the right ordering of rulers in a state or nation. One is that all should take some share in the government: for this form of constitution ensures peace among the people, commends itself to all, and is most enduring, as stated in Polit. ii, 6. The other point is to be observed in respect of the kinds of government, or the different ways in which the constitutions are established. For whereas these differ in kind, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. iii, 5), nevertheless the first place is held by the "kingdom," where the power of government is vested in one; and "aristocracy," which signifies government by the best, where the power of government is vested in a few. Accordingly, the best form of government is in a state or kingdom, where one is given the power to preside over all; while under him are others having governing powers: and yet a government of this kind is shared by all, both because all are eligible to govern, and because the rules are chosen by all. For this is the best form of polity, being partly kingdom, since there is one at the head of all; partly aristocracy, in so far as a number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are set in authority; partly democracy, i.e. government by the people, in so far as the rulers can be chosen from the people, and the people have the right to choose their rulers.

<p>Such was the form of government established by the Divine Law. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and his successors governed the people in such a way that each of them was ruler over all; so that there was a kind of kingdom. Moreover, seventy-two men were chosen, who were elders in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>): "I took out of your tribes wise and honorable, and appointed them rulers": so that there was an element of aristocracy. But it was a democratical government in so far as the rulers were chosen from all the people; for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse21">Exodus 18:21</a>): "Provide out of all the people wise [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'able'] men," etc.; and, again, in so far as they were chosen by the people; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>): "Let me have from among you wise [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'able'] men," etc. Consequently it is evident that the ordering of the rulers was well provided for by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This people was governed under the special care of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath chosen thee to be His peculiar people": and this is why the Lord reserved to Himself the institution of the chief ruler. For this too did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> (<a href="../bible/num027.htm#verse16">Numbers 27:16</a>): "May the Lord the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the spirits of all the flesh provide a man, that may be over this multitude." Thus by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> orders <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> was set at the head in place of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and we read about each of the judges who succeeded <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "raised . . . up a saviour" for the people, and that "the spirit of the Lord was" in them (<a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#verse9">Judges 3:9-15</a>). Hence the Lord did not leave the choice of a king to the people; but reserved this to Himself, as appears from <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>: "Thou shalt set him whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall choose."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A kingdom is the best form of government of the people, so long as it is not corrupt. But since the power granted to a king is so great, it easily degenerates into tyranny, unless he to whom this power is given be a very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for it is only the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that conducts himself well in the midst of prosperity, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iv, 3). Now perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be found in few: and especially were the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> inclined to cruelty and avarice, which <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> above all turn men into tyrants. Hence from the very first the Lord did not set up the kingly authority with full power, but gave them judges and governors to rule them. But afterwards when the people asked Him to do so, being indignant with them, so to speak, He granted them a king, as is clear from His words to Samuel (<a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#verse7">1 Samuel 8:7</a>): "They have not rejected thee, but Me, that I should not reign over them."

<p>Nevertheless, as regards the appointment of a king, He did establish the manner of election from the very beginning (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 17:14, seqq.</a>): and then He determined two points: first, that in choosing a king they should wait for the Lord's decision; and that they should not make a man of another nation king, because such kings are wont to take little interest in the people they are set over, and consequently to have no care for their welfare: secondly, He prescribed how the king after his appointment should behave, in regard to himself; namely, that he should not accumulate chariots and horses, nor wives, nor immense <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>: because through craving for such things princes become tyrants and forsake <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. He also appointed the manner in which they were to conduct themselves towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: namely, that they should continually read and ponder on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Law, and should ever fear and obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, He decided how they should behave towards their subjects: namely, that they should not proudly despise them, or ill-treat them, and that they should not depart from the paths of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The division of the kingdom, and a number of kings, was rather a punishment inflicted on that people for their many dissensions, specially against the just rule of David, than a benefit conferred on them for their profit. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse11">Hosea 13:11</a>): "I will give thee a king in My wrath"; and (<a href="../bible/hos008.htm#verse4">Hosea 8:4</a>): "They have reigned, but not by Me: they have been princes, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office was bequeathed by succession from father to son: and this, in order that it might be held in greater respect, if not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the people could become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: since <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> was given to them out of reverence for the divine worship. Hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to put aside certain things for them both as to <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and as to first-fruits, and, again, as to oblations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, that they might be afforded a means of livelihood. On the other hand, the rulers, as stated above, were chosen from the whole people; wherefore they had their own possessions, from which to derive a living: and so much the more, since the Lord forbade even a king to have superabundant <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to make too much show of magnificence: both because he could scarcely avoid the excesses of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and tyranny, arising from such things, and because, if the rulers were not very rich, and if their office involved much work and anxiety, it would not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the ambition of the common people; and would not become an occasion of sedition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> That right was not given to the king by Divine institution: rather was it foretold that kings would usurp that right, by framing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> laws, and by degenerating into tyrants who preyed on their subjects. This is clear from the context that follows: "And you shall be his slaves [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'servants']": which is significative of tyranny, since a tyrant rules is subjects as though they were his slaves. Hence Samuel spoke these words to deter them from asking for a king; since the narrative continues: "But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel." It may happen, however, that even a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> king, without being a tyrant, may take away the sons, and make them tribunes and centurions; and may take many things from his subjects in order to secure the common weal.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the judicial precepts were suitably framed as to the relations of one man with another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judicial precepts were not suitably framed as regards the relations of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with another. Because men cannot live together in peace, if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes what belongs to another. But this seems to have been approved by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: since it is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy 23:24</a>): "Going into thy neighbor's vineyard, thou mayest eat as many grapes as thou pleasest." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not make suitable provisions for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> peace.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one of the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of the downfall of states has been the holding of property by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. ii, 6). But this was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/num027.htm#verse8">Numbers 27:8</a>): "When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his daughter." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made unsuitable provision for the welfare of the people.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is most conducive to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society that men may provide themselves with necessaries by buying and selling, as stated in Polit. i. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> took away the force of sales; since it prescribes that in the 50th year of the jubilee all that is sold shall return to the vendor (<a href="../bible/lev025.htm#verse28">Leviticus 25:28</a>). Therefore in this matter the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> gave the people an unfitting command.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> needs require that men should be ready to lend: which readiness ceases if the creditors do not return the pledges: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir029.htm#verse10">Sirach 29:10</a>): "Many have refused to lend, not out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but they were afraid to be defrauded without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." And yet this was encouraged by the Law. First, because it prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>): "He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbor or brother, cannot demand it again, because it is the year of remission of the Lord"; and (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse15">Exodus 22:15</a>) it is stated that if a borrowed animal should die while the owner is present, the borrower is not bound to make restitution. Secondly, because the security acquired through the pledge is lost: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>): "When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor any thing that he oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge"; and again (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 24:12-13</a>): "The pledge shall not lodge with thee that night, but thou shalt restore it to him presently." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made insufficient provision in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of loans.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, considerable risk attaches to goods deposited with a fraudulent depositary: wherefore great caution should be observed in such matters: hence it is stated in <a href="../bible/2ma003.htm#verse15">2 Maccabees 3:15</a> that "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> . . . called upon Him from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, Who made the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> concerning things given to be kept, that He would preserve them safe, for them that had deposited them." But the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> observed little caution in regard to deposits: since it is prescribed (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse10">Exodus 22:10-11</a>) that when goods deposited are lost, the owner is to stand by the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the depositary. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made unsuitable provision in this matter.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, just as a workman offers his work for hire, so do men let houses and so forth. But there is no need for the tenant to pay his rent as soon as he takes a house. Therefore it seems an unnecessarily hard prescription (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse13">Leviticus 19:13</a>) that "the wages of him that hath been hired by thee shall not abide with thee until morning."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, since there is often pressing need for a judge, it should be easy to gain access to one. It was therefore unfitting that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a>) should command them to go to a fixed place to ask for judgment on <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, it is possible that not only two, but three or more, should agree to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. Therefore it is unreasonably stated (<a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>) that "in the mouth of two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> every word shall stand."

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, punishment should be fixed according to the gravity of the fault: for which reason also it is written (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, shall the measure also of the stripes be." Yet the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> fixed unequal punishments for certain faults: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> "shall restore five oxen for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep." Moreover, certain slight offenses are severely punished: thus (<a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse32">Numbers 15:32, seqq.</a>) a man is stoned for gathering sticks on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> day: and (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 21:18, seqq.</a>) the unruly son is commanded to be stoned on account of certain small transgressions, viz. because "he gave himself to revelling . . . and banquetings." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed punishments in an unreasonable manner.

<p><strong>Objection 10.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 11), "Tully writes that the laws recognize eight forms of punishment, indemnity, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, stripes, retaliation, public disgrace, exile, death, slavery." Now some of these were prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. "Indemnity," as when a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> was condemned to make restitution fivefold or fourfold. "Prison," as when (<a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse34">Numbers 15:34</a>) a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordered to be imprisoned. "Stripes"; thus (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>), "if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes; they shall lay him down, and shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to be beaten before them." "Public disgrace" was brought on to him who refused to take to himself the wife of his deceased brother, for she took "off his shoe from his foot, and" did "spit in his face" (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>). It prescribed the "death" penalty, as is clear from (<a href="../bible/lev020.htm#verse9">Leviticus 20:9</a>): "He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die." The Law also recognized the "lex talionis," by prescribing (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse24">Exodus 21:24</a>): "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth." Therefore it seems unreasonable that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> should not have inflicted the two other punishments, viz. "exile" and "slavery."

<p><strong>Objection 11.</strong> Further, no punishment is due except for a fault. But dumb animals cannot commit a fault. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is unreasonable in punishing them (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse29">Exodus 21:29</a>): "If the ox . . . shall kill a man or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>," it "shall be stoned": and (<a href="../bible/lev020.htm#verse16">Leviticus 20:16</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that shall lie under any beast, shall be killed together with the same." Therefore it seems that matters pertaining to the relations of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with another were unsuitably regulated by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 12.</strong> Further, the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse12">Exodus 21:12</a>) a murderer to be punished with death. But the death of a dumb animal is reckoned of much less account than the slaying of a man. Hence <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> cannot be sufficiently punished by the slaying of a dumb animal. Therefore it is unfittingly prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 21:1-4</a>) that "when there shall be found . . . the corpse of a man slain, and it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who is guilty of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> . . . the ancients" of the nearest city "shall take a heifer of the herd, that hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground, and they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that never was ploughed, nor sown; and there they shall strike off the head of the heifer."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is recalled as a special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> (<a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse20">Psalm 147:20</a>) that "He hath not done in like manner to every nation; and His judgments He hath not made manifest to them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21), quoting Tully, "a nation is a body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> united together by consent to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and by community of welfare." Consequently it is of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a nation that the mutual relations of the citizens be ordered by just laws. Now the relations of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with another are twofold: some are effected under the guidance of those in authority: others are effected by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. And since whatever is subject to the power of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> can be disposed of according to his will, hence it is that the decision of matters between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another, and the punishment of evildoers, depend on the direction of those in authority, to whom men are subject. On the other hand, the power of private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is exercised over the things they possess: and consequently their dealings with one another, as regards such things, depend on their own will, for instance in buying, selling, giving, and so forth. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> provided sufficiently in respect of each of these relations between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another. For it established judges, as is clearly indicated in <a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>: "Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all its [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'thy'] gates . . . that they may judge the people with just judgment." It is also directed the manner of pronouncing just judgments, according to <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>: "Judge that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, whether he be one of your own country or a stranger: there shall be no difference of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." It also removed an occasion of pronouncing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment, by forbidding judges to accept bribes (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse19">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>). It prescribed the number of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, viz. two or three: and it appointed certain punishments to certain crimes, as we shall state farther on (ad 10).

<p>But with regard to possessions, it is a very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, says the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. ii, 2) that the things possessed should be distinct, and the use thereof should be partly common, and partly granted to others by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the possessors. These three points were provided for by the Law. Because, in the first place, the possessions themselves were divided among <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/num033.htm#verse53">Numbers 33:53-54</a>): "I have given you" the land "for a possession: and you shall divide it among you by lot." And since many states have been ruined through want of regulations in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of possessions, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Polit. ii, 6); therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> provided a threefold remedy against the regularity of possessions. The first was that they should be divided equally, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/num033.htm#verse54">Numbers 33:54</a>): "To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer, a lesser." A second remedy was that possessions could not be alienated for ever, but after a certain lapse of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> should return to their former owner, so as to avoid confusion of possessions (cf. ad 3). The third remedy aimed at the removal of this confusion, and provided that the dead should be succeeded by their next of kin: in the first place, the son; secondly, the daughter; thirdly, the brother; fourthly, the father's brother; fifthly, any other next of kin. Furthermore, in order to preserve the distinction of property, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> enacted that heiresses should marry within their own tribe, as recorded in <a href="../bible/num036.htm#verse6">Numbers 36:6</a>.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded that, in some respects, the use of things should belong to all in common. Firstly, as regards the care of them; for it was prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 22:1-4</a>): "Thou shalt not pass by, if thou seest thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray; but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother," and in like manner as to other things. Secondly, as regards fruits. For all alike were allowed on entering a friend's vineyard to eat of the fruit, but not to take any away. And, specially, with respect to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, it was prescribed that the forgotten sheaves, and the bunches of grapes and fruit, should be left behind for them (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse19">Leviticus 19:9</a>; <a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>). Moreover, whatever grew in the seventh year was common property, as stated in <a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse11">Exodus 23:11</a> and <a href="../bible/lev025.htm#verse4">Leviticus 25:4</a>.

<p>Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> recognized the transference of goods by the owner. There was a purely gratuitous transfer: thus it is written (<a href="../bible/deu014.htm#verse28">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>): "The third day thou shalt separate another <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> . . . and the Levite . . . and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> . . . shall come and shall eat and be filled." And there was a transfer for a consideration, for instance, by selling and buying, by letting out and hiring, by loan and also by deposit, concerning all of which we find that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made ample provision. Consequently it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> provided sufficiently concerning the mutual relations of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans 13:8</a>), "he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>": because, to wit, all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, chiefly those concerning our neighbor, seem to aim at the end that men should love one another. Now it is an effect of love that men give their own goods to others: because, as stated in <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse17">1 John 3:17</a>: "He that . . . shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abide in him?" Hence the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was to accustom men to give of their own to others readily: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse18">1 Timothy 6:18</a>) commands the rich "to give easily and to communicate to others." Now a man does not give easily to others if he will not suffer another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to take some little thing from him without any great injury to him. And so the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> laid down that it should be lawful for a man, on entering his neighbor's vineyard, to eat of the fruit there: but not to carry any away, lest this should lead to the infliction of a grievous harm, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a disturbance of the peace: for among well-behaved people, the taking of a little does not disturb the peace; in fact, it rather strengthens friendship and accustoms men to give things to one another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Law did not prescribe that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should succeed to their father's estate except in default of male issue: failing which it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that succession should be granted to the female line in order to comfort the father, who would have been sad to think that his estate would pass to strangers. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> observed due caution in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, by providing that those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who succeeded to their father's estate, should marry within their own tribe, in order to avoid confusion of tribal possessions, as stated in <a href="../bible/num036.htm#verse7">Numbers 36:7-8</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. ii, 4), the regulation of possessions conduces much to the preservation of a state or nation. Consequently, as he himself observes, it was forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in some of the heathen states, "that anyone should sell his possessions, except to avoid a manifest loss." For if possessions were to be sold indiscriminately, they might happen to come into the hands of a few: so that it might become <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a state or country to become void of inhabitants. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, in order to remove this danger, ordered things in such a way that while provision was made for men's needs, by allowing the sale of possessions to avail for a certain period, at the same time the said danger was removed, by prescribing the return of those possessions after that period had elapsed. The reason for this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was to prevent confusion of possessions, and to ensure the continuance of a definite distinction among the tribes.

<p>But as the town houses were not allotted to distinct estates, therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> allowed them to be sold in perpetuity, like movable goods. Because the number of houses in a town was not fixed, whereas there was a fixed limit to the amount of estates, which could not be exceeded, while the number of houses in a town could be increased. On the other hand, houses situated not in a town, but "in a village that hath no walls," could not be sold in perpetuity: because such houses are built merely with a view to the cultivation and care of possessions; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> rightly made the same prescription in regard to both (<a href="../bible/lev025.htm">Leviticus 25</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above (ad 1), the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was to accustom men to its precepts, so as to be ready to come to one another's assistance: because this is a very great incentive to friendship. The Law granted these facilities for helping others in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not only of gratuitous and absolute donations, but also of mutual transfers: because the latter kind of succor is more frequent and benefits the greater number: and it granted facilities for this purpose in many ways. First of all by prescribing that men should be ready to lend, and that they should not be less inclined to do so as the year of remission drew nigh, as stated in <a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>, seqq. Secondly, by forbidding them to burden a man to whom they might grant a loan, either by exacting usury, or by accepting necessities of life in security; and by prescribing that when this had been done they should be restored at once. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>): "Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury": and (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>): "Thou shalt not take the nether nor the upper millstone to pledge; for he hath pledged his life to thee": and (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse26">Exodus 22:26</a>): "If thou take of thy neighbor a garment in pledge, thou shalt give it him again before sunset." Thirdly, by forbidding them to be importunate in exacting payment. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse25">Exodus 22:25</a>): "If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor that dwelleth with thee, thou shalt not be hard upon them as an extortioner." For this reason, too, it is enacted (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 24:10-11</a>): "When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor anything that he oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge, but thou shalt stand without, and he shall bring out to thee what he hath": both because a man's house is his surest refuge, wherefore it is offensive to a man to be set upon in his own house; and because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> does not allow the creditor to take away whatever he likes in security, but rather permits the debtor to give what he needs least. Fourthly, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed that debts should cease together after the lapse of seven years. For it was probable that those who could conveniently pay their debts, would do so before the seventh year, and would not defraud the lender without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But if they were altogether insolvent, there was the same reason for remitting the debt from love for them, as there was for renewing the loan on account of their need.

<p>As regards animals granted in loan, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> enacted that if, through the neglect of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom they were lent, they perished or deteriorated in his absence, he was bound to make restitution. But if they perished or deteriorated while he was present and taking proper care of them, he was not bound to make restitution, especially if they were hired for a consideration: because they might have died or deteriorated in the same way if they had remained in possession of the lender, so that if the animal had been saved through being lent, the lender would have gained something by the loan which would no longer have been gratuitous. And especially was this to be observed when animals were hired for a consideration: because then the owner received a certain price for the use of the animals; wherefore he had no right to any profit, by receiving indemnity for the animal, unless the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who had charge of it were negligent. In the case, however, of animals not hired for a consideration, equity demanded that he should receive something by way of restitution at least to the value of the hire of the animal that had perished or deteriorated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The difference between a loan and a deposit is that a loan is in respect of goods transferred for the use of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom they are transferred, whereas a deposit is for the benefit of the depositor. Hence in certain cases there was a stricter <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of returning a loan than of restoring goods held in deposit. Because the latter might be lost in two ways. First, unavoidably: i.e. either through a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance if an animal held in deposit were to die or depreciate in value; or through an extrinsic <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance, if it were taken by an enemy, or devoured by a beast (in which case, however, a man was bound to restore to the owner what was left of the animal thus slain): whereas in the other cases mentioned above, he was not bound to make restitution; but only to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in order to clear himself of suspicion. Secondly, the goods deposited might be lost through an avoidable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: and then the depositary was bound to restitution on account of his neglect. But, as stated above (ad 4), he who held an animal on loan, was bound to restitution, even if he were absent when it depreciated or died: because he was held responsible for less negligence than a depositary, who was only held responsible in case of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Workmen who offer their labor for hire, are poor men who toil for their daily bread: and therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded wisely that they should be paid at once, lest they should lack food. But they who offer other commodities for hire, are wont to be rich: nor are they in such need of their price in order to gain a livelihood: and consequently the comparison does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The purpose for which judges are appointed among men, is that they may decide <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> points in matters of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> in two ways. First, among simple-minded people: and in order to remove <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of this kind, it was prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>) that "judges and magistrates" should be appointed in each tribe, "to judge the people with just judgment." Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> even among experts: and therefore, in order to remove <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of this kind, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed that all should foregather in some chief place chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where there would be both the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, who would decide <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters relating to the ceremonies of divine worship; and the chief judge of the people, who would decide matters relating to the judgments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: just as even now cases are taken from a lower to a higher court either by appeal or by consultation. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a>): "If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in judgment . . . and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do vary; arise and go up to the place, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall choose; and thou shalt come to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Levitical race, and to the judge that shall be at that time." But such like <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> matters did not often occur for judgment: wherefore the people were not burdened on this account.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> In the business affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there is no such thing as demonstrative and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and we must be content with a certain conjectural probability, such as that which an orator employs to persuade. Consequently, although it is quite possible for two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to agree to a falsehood, yet it is neither easy nor probable that they succeed in so doing: wherefore their testimony is taken as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, especially if they do not waver in giving it, or are not otherwise suspect. Moreover, in order that <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> might not easily depart from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded that they should be most carefully examined, and that those who were found untruthful should be severely punished, as stated in <a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>, seqq.

<p>There was, however, a reason for fixing on this particular number, in token of the unerring <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine Persons, Who are sometimes mentioned as two, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the bond of the other two Persons; and sometimes as three: as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes on <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse17">John 8:17</a>: "In your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> it is written that the testimony of two men is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> A severe punishment is inflicted not only on account of the gravity of a fault, but also for other reasons. First, on account of the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, other things being equal, deserves a greater punishment. Secondly, on account of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since men are not easily cured of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except by severe punishments. Thirdly, on account of a great desire for or a great pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for men are not easily deterred from such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unless they be severely punished. Fourthly, on account of the facility of committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of concealing it: for such like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when discovered, should be more severely punished in order to deter others from committing them.

<p>Again, with regard to the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, four degrees may be observed, even in respect of one single <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. The first is when a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed unwillingly; because then, if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be altogether involuntary, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is altogether excused from punishment; for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy 22:25, seqq.</a>) that a damsel who suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in a field is not guilty of death, because "she cried, and there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to help her." But if a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in any way <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, and yet through weakness, as for instance when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from passion, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is diminished: and the punishment, according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment, should be diminished also; unless perchance the common weal requires that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be severely punished in order to deter others from committing such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above. The second degree is when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: and then he was held to be guilty to a certain extent, on account of his negligence in acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: yet he was not punished by the judges but expiated his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/lev004.htm#verse2">Leviticus 4:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>," etc. This is, however, to be taken as applying to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact; and not to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Divine precept, which all were bound to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The third degree was when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, i.e. through deliberate choice or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: and then he was punished according to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>. The fourth degree was when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> from stubbornness or obstinacy: and then he was to be utterly cut off as a rebel and a destroyer of the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse30">Numbers 15:30-31</a>.

<p>Accordingly we must say that, in appointing the punishment for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> considered what would be likely to happen most frequently (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse1">Exodus 22:1-9</a>): wherefore, as regards <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of other things which can easily be safeguarded from a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> restored only twice their value. But sheep cannot be easily safeguarded from a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, because they graze in the fields: wherefore it happened more frequently that sheep were stolen in the fields. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> inflicted a heavier penalty, by ordering four sheep to be restored for the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> of one. As to cattle, they were yet more difficult to safeguard, because they are kept in the fields, and do not graze in flocks as sheep do; wherefore a yet more heavy penalty was inflicted in their regard, so that five oxen were to be restored for one ox. And this I say, unless perchance the animal itself were discovered in the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>'s possession: because in that case he had to restore only twice the number, as in the case of other thefts: for there was reason to presume that he intended to restore the animal, since he kept it alive. Again, we might say, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, that "a cow is useful in five ways: it may be used for sacrifice, for ploughing, for food, for milk, and its hide is employed for various purposes": and therefore for one cow five had to be restored. But the sheep was useful in four ways: "for sacrifice, for meat, for milk, and for its wool." The unruly son was slain, not because he ate and drank: but on account of his stubbornness and rebellion, which was always punished by death, as stated above. As to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who gathered sticks on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, he was stoned as a breaker of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which commanded the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> to be observed, to testify the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the newness of the world, as stated above (Question 100, Article 5): wherefore he was slain as an unbeliever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 10.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> inflicted the death penalty for the more grievous crimes, viz. for those which are committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, for stealing a man, irreverence towards one's parents, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>. In the case of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> of other things it inflicted punishment by indemnification: while in the case of blows and mutilation it authorized punishment by retaliation; and likewise for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of bearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness. In other faults of less degree it prescribed the punishment of stripes or of public disgrace.

<p>The punishment of slavery was prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in two cases. First, in the case of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> who was unwilling to avail himself of the privilege granted by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, whereby he was free to depart in the seventh year of remission: wherefore he was punished by remaining a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> for ever. Secondly, in the case of a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, who had not wherewith to make restitution, as stated in <a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse3">Exodus 22:3</a>.

<p>The punishment of absolute exile was not prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was worshipped by that people alone, whereas all other nations were given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: wherefore if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were exiled from that people absolutely, he would be in danger of falling into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For this reason it is related (<a href="../bible/1sa026.htm#verse19">1 Samuel 26:19</a>) that David said to Saul: "They are <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> in the sight of the Lord, who have case me out this day, that I should not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve strange gods." There was, however, a restricted sort of exile: for it is written in <a href="../bible/deu019.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 19:4</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/num035.htm#verse25">Numbers 35:25</a> that "he that striketh [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'killeth'] his neighbor ignorantly, and is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have had no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against him, shall flee to one of the cities" of refuge and "abide there until the death of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>." For then it became lawful for him to return home, because when the whole people thus suffered a loss they forgot their private quarrels, so that the next of kin of the slain were not so eager to kill the slayer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 11.</strong> Dumb animals were ordered to be slain, not on account of any fault of theirs; but as a punishment to their owners, who had not safeguarded their beasts from these offenses. Hence the owner was more severely punished if his ox had butted anyone "yesterday or the day before" (in which case steps might have been taken to butting suddenly). Or again, the animal was slain in detestation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and lest men should be horrified at the sight thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 12.</strong> The literal reason for this commandment, as <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a> declares (Doct. Perplex. iii), was because the slayer was frequently from the nearest city: wherefore the slaying of the calf was a means of investigating the hidden <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. This was brought about in three ways. In the first place the elders of the city swore that they had taken every measure for safeguarding the roads. Secondly, the owner of the heifer was indemnified for the slaying of his beast, and if the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was previously discovered, the beast was not slain. Thirdly, the place, where the heifer was slain, remained uncultivated. Wherefore, in order to avoid this twofold loss, the men of the city would readily make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the murderer, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who he was: and it would seldom happen but that some word or sign would escape about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Or again, this was done in order to frighten people, in detestation of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Because the slaying of a heifer, which is a useful animal and full of strength, especially before it has been put under the yoke, signified that whoever committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, however useful and strong he might be, was to forfeit his life; and that, by a cruel death, which was implied by the striking off of its head; and that the murderer, as vile and abject, was to be cut off from the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which was betokened by the fact that the heifer after being slain was left to rot in a rough and uncultivated place.

<p>Mystically, the heifer taken from the herd signifies the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; which had not drawn a yoke, since it had done no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; nor did it plough the ground, i.e. it never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the stain of revolt. The fact of the heifer being killed in an uncultivated valley signified the despised death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are washed away, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is shown to be the arch-murderer.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the judicial precepts regarding foreigners were framed in a suitable manner?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the judicial precepts regarding foreigners were not suitably framed. For <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts 10:34-35</a>): "In very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> I perceive that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but in every nation, he that feareth Him and worketh <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is acceptable to Him." But those who are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>) that "the Ammonite and the Moabite, even after the tenth generation, shall not enter into the church of the Lord for ever": whereas, on the other hand, it is prescribed (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>) to be observed with regard to certain other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: "Thou shalt not abhor the Edomite, because he is thy brother; nor the Egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we do not deserve to be punished for those things which are not in our power. But it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to be an eunuch, or born of a prostitute. Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 23:1-2</a>) that "an eunuch and one born of a prostitute shalt not enter into the church of the Lord."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> mercifully forbade strangers to be molested: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse21">Exodus 22:21</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger, nor afflict him; for yourselves also were strangers in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>": and (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse9">Exodus 23:9</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the hearts of strangers, for you also were strangers in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>." But it is an affliction to be burdened with usury. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> unsuitably permitted them (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>) to lend money to the stranger for usury.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, men are much more akin to us than trees. But we should show greater care and love for these things that are nearest to us, according to <a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>: "Every beast loveth its like: so also every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> him that is nearest to himself." Therefore the Lord unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 20:13-19</a>) that all the inhabitants of a captured hostile city were to be slain, but that the fruit-trees should not be cut down.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every one should prefer the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is sought in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which men fight against their enemies. Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 20:5-7</a>) that certain men should be sent home, for instance a man that had built a new house, or who had planted a vineyard, or who had <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> a wife.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should profit by his own fault. But it is a man's fault if he be timid or faint-hearted: since this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore the timid and faint-hearted are unfittingly excused from the toil of battle (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Divine Wisdom declares (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse8">Proverbs 8:8</a>): "All my words are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> nor perverse in them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> relations with foreigners are twofold: peaceful, and hostile: and in directing both kinds of relation the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contained suitable precepts. For the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were offered three opportunities of peaceful relations with foreigners. First, when foreigners passed through their land as travelers. Secondly, when they came to dwell in their land as newcomers. And in both these respects the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made kind provision in its precepts: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse21">Exodus 22:21</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger [advenam]"; and again (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse9">Exodus 22:9</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger [peregrino]." Thirdly, when any foreigners wished to be admitted entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. With regard to these a certain order was observed. For they were not at once admitted to citizenship: just as it was <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with some nations that no one was deemed a citizen except after two or three generations, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 1). The reason for this was that if foreigners were allowed to meddle with the affairs of a nation as soon as they settled down in its midst, many dangers might occur, since the foreigners not yet having the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> firmly at heart might attempt something hurtful to the people. Hence it was that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed in respect of certain nations that had close relations with the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> (viz., the Egyptians among whom they were born and educated, and the Idumeans, the children of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> brother), that they should be admitted to the fellowship of the people after the third generation; whereas others (with whom their relations had been hostile, such as the Ammonites and <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>) were never to be admitted to citizenship; while the Amalekites, who were yet more hostile to them, and had no fellowship of kindred with them, were to be held as foes in perpetuity: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse16">Exodus 17:16</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Lord shall be against <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> from generation to generation."

<p>In like manner with regard to hostile relations with foreigners, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contained suitable precepts. For, in the first place, it commanded that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> should be declared for a just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus it is commanded (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>) that when they advanced to besiege a city, they should at first make an offer of peace. Secondly, it enjoined that when once they had entered on a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> they should undauntedly persevere in it, putting their trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in order that they might be the more heedful of this command, it ordered that on the approach of battle the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should hearten them by promising them <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> aid. Thirdly, it prescribed the removal of whatever might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> an obstacle to the fight, and that certain men, who might be in the way, should be sent home. Fourthly, it enjoined that they should use moderation in pursuing the advantage of victory, by sparing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and by not cutting down fruit-trees of that country.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Law excluded the men of no nation from the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and from things pertaining to the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse48">Exodus 12:48</a>): "If any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord; all his males shall first be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner, and he shall be as that which is born in the land." But in temporal matters concerning the public life of the people, admission was not granted to everyone at once, for the reason given above: but to some, i.e. the Egyptians and Idumeans, in the third generation; while others were excluded in perpetuity, in detestation of their past offense, i.e. the peoples of Moab, Ammon, and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>. For just as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by him, in order that others seeing this may be deterred and refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>; so too may one nation or city be punished for a crime, that others may refrain from similar crimes.

<p>Nevertheless it was possible by dispensation for a man to be admitted to citizenship on account of some act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus it is related (<a href="../bible/jth014.htm#verse6">Judith 14:6</a>) that Achior, the captain of the children of Ammon, "was joined to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with all the succession of his kindred." The same applies to Ruth the Moabite who was "a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" (<a href="../bible/rut003.htm#verse11">Ruth 3:11</a>): although it may be said that this prohibition regarded men and not <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who are not competent to be citizens absolutely speaking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. iii, 3), a man is said to be a citizen in two ways: first, simply; secondly, in a restricted sense. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a citizen simply if he has all the rights of citizenship, for instance, the right of debating or voting in the popular assembly. On the other hand, any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be called citizen, only in a restricted sense, if he dwells within the state, even common people or children or old men, who are not fit to enjoy power in matters pertaining to the common weal. For this reason bastards, by reason of their base origin, were excluded from the "ecclesia," i.e. from the popular assembly, down to the tenth generation. The same applies to eunuchs, who were not competent to receive the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to a father, especially among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, where the divine worship was continued through carnal generation: for even among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, those who had many children were marked with special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Polit. ii, 6). Nevertheless, in matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, eunuchs were not discriminated from others, as neither were strangers, as already stated: for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse3">Isaiah 56:3</a>): "Let not the son of the stranger that adhereth to the Lord speak, saying: The Lord will divide and separate me from His people. And let not the eunuch say: Behold I am a dry tree."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was not the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to sanction the acceptance of usury from strangers, but only to tolerate it on account of the proneness of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> to avarice; and in order to promote an amicable feeling towards those out of whom they made a profit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A distinction was observed with regard to hostile cities. For some of them were far distant, and were not among those which had been promised to them. When they had taken these cities, they killed all the men who had fought against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people; whereas the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children were spared. But in the neighboring cities which had been promised to them, all were ordered to be slain, on account of their former crimes, to punish which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent the Israelites as executor of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu009.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 9:5</a>) "because they have done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in." The fruit-trees were commanded to be left untouched, for the use of the people themselves, to whom the city with its territory was destined to be subjected.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The builder of a new house, the planter of a vineyard, the newly <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> husband, were excluded from fighting, for two reasons. First, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is wont to give all his affection to those things which he has lately acquired, or is on the point of having, and consequently he is apt to dread the loss of these above other things. Wherefore it was likely enough that on account of this affection they would fear death all the more, and be so much the less brave in battle. Secondly, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 5), "it is a misfortune for a man if he is prevented from obtaining something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when it is within his grasp." And so lest the surviving relations should be the more grieved at the death of these men who had not entered into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things prepared for them; and also lest the people should be horror-stricken at the sight of their misfortune: these men were taken away from the danger of death by being removed from the battle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The timid were sent back home, not that they might be the gainers thereby; but lest the people might be the losers by their presence, since their timidity and flight might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> others to be afraid and run away.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Old Law set forth suitable precepts about the members of the household?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> set forth unsuitable precepts about the members of the household. For a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> "is in every respect his master's property," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 2). But that which is a man's property should be his always. Therefore it was unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to command (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse2">Exodus 21:2</a>) that slaves should "go out free" in the seventh year.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's property, just as an animal, e.g. an ass or an ox. But it is commanded (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 22:1-3</a>) with regard to animals, that they should be brought back to the owner if they be found going astray. Therefore it was unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 23:15</a>): "Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to thee."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Divine Law should encourage mercy more even than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws those who ill-treat their servants and maidservants are severely punished: and the worse treatment of all seems to be that which results in death. Therefore it is unfittingly commanded (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse20">Exodus 21:20-21</a>) that "he that striketh his bondman or bondwoman with a rod, and they die under his hands . . . if the party remain alive a day . . . he shall not be subject to the punishment, because it is his money."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the dominion of a master over his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> differs from that of the father over his son (Polit. i, 3). But the dominion of master over <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> gives the former the right to sell his servant or maidservant. Therefore it was unfitting for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to allow a man to sell his daughter to be a servant or handmaid (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse7">Exodus 21:7</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a father has power over his son. But he who has power over the sinner has the right to punish him for his offenses. Therefore it is unfittingly commanded (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 21:18, seqq.</a>) that a father should bring his son to the ancients of the city for punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the Lord forbade them (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 7:3, seqq.</a>) to make marriages with strange <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; and commanded the dissolution of such as had been contracted (<a href="../bible/ezr010.htm">Ezra 10</a>). Therefore it was unfitting to allow them to marry captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from strange nations (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 21:10, seqq.</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, the Lord forbade them to marry within certain degrees of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and affinity, according to <a href="../bible/lev018.htm">Leviticus 18</a>. Therefore it was unsuitably commanded (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>) that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> died without issue, his brother should marry his wife.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, as there is the greatest familiarity between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and wife, so should there be the staunchest fidelity. But this is impossible if the marriage bond can be sundered. Therefore it was unfitting for the Lord to allow (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>) a man to put his wife away, by writing a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>; and besides, that he could not take her again to wife.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, just as a wife can be faithless to her husband, so can a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> be to his master, and a son to his father. But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not command any sacrifice to be offered in order to investigate the injury done by a servant to his master, or by a son to his father. Therefore it seems to have been superfluous for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to prescribe the "sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>" in order to investigate a wife's <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> (<a href="../bible/num005.htm#verse12">Numbers 5:12, seqq.</a>). Consequently it seems that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> put forth unsuitable judicial precepts about the members of the household.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse10">Psalm 18:10</a>): "The judgments of the Lord are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, justified in themselves."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The mutual relations of the members of a household regard everyday actions directed to the necessities of life, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Polit. i, 1). Now the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life may be considered from two points of view. First, from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, i.e. in so far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> preserves his <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>: and for the purpose of the preservation of life, considered from this standpoint, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has at his service external goods, by means of which he provides himself with food and clothing and other such necessaries of life: in the handling of which he has need of servants. Secondly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is preserved from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by means of generation, for which purpose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a wife, that she may bear him children. Accordingly the mutual relations of the members of a household admit of a threefold combination: viz. those of master and servant, those of husband and wife, and those of father and son: and in respect of all these relationships the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained fitting precepts. Thus, with regard to servants, it commanded them to be treated with moderation--both as to their work, lest, to wit, they should be burdened with excessive labor, wherefore the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>) that on the Sabbath day "thy manservant and thy maidservant" should "rest even as thyself"--and also as to the infliction of punishment, for it ordered those who maimed their servants, to set them free (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse26">Exodus 21:26-27</a>). Similar provision was made in favor of a maidservant when <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> to anyone (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse7">Exodus 21:7, seqq.</a>). Moreover, with regard to those servants in particular who were taken from among the people, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed that they should go out free in the seventh year taking whatever they brought with them, even their clothes (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse2">Exodus 21:2, seqq.</a>): and furthermore it was commanded (<a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 15:13</a>) that they should be given provision for the journey.

<p>With regard to wives the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> made certain prescriptions as to those who were to be taken in marriage: for instance, that they should marry a wife from their own tribe (<a href="../bible/num036.htm#verse6">Numbers 36:6</a>): and this lest confusion should ensue in the property of various tribes. Also that a man should marry the wife of his deceased brother when the latter died without issue, as prescribed in <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>: and this in order that he who could not have successors according to carnal origin, might at least have them by a kind of adoption, and that thus the deceased might not be entirely forgotten. It also forbade them to marry certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; to wit, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of strange <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, through fear of their losing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and those of their near kindred, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> respect due to them. Furthermore it prescribed in what way wives were to be treated after marriage. To wit, that they should not be slandered without grave reason: wherefore it ordered punishment to be inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused his wife of a crime (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy 22:13, seqq.</a>). Also that a man's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his wife should not be detrimental to his son (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 21:15, seqq.</a>). Again, that a man should not ill-use his wife through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of her, but rather that he should write a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> and send her away (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>). Furthermore, in order to foster conjugal love from the very outset, it was prescribed that no public duties should be laid on a recently <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that he might be free to rejoice with his wife.

<p>With regard to children, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded parents to educate them by instructing them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse26">Exodus 12:26, seqq.</a>): "When your children shall say to you: What is the meaning of this service? You shall say to them: It is the victim of the passage of the Lord." Moreover, they are commanded to teach them the rules of right conduct: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>) that the parents had to say: "He slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling and to debauchery."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had been delivered by the Lord from slavery, and for this reason were bound to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He did not wish them to be slaves in perpetuity. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/lev025.htm#verse39">Leviticus 25:39, seqq.</a>): "If thy brother, constrained by <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, sell himself to thee, thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants: but he shall be as a hireling and a sojourner . . . for they are My servants, and I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: let them not be sold as bondmen": and consequently, since they were slaves, not absolutely but in a restricted sense, after a lapse of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> they were set free.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This commandment is to be understood as referring to a servant whom his master seeks to kill, or to help him in committing some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> With regard to the ill-treatment of servants, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> seems to have taken into consideration whether it was certain or not: since if it were certain, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> fixed a penalty: for maiming, the penalty was forfeiture of the servant, who was ordered to be given his liberty: while for slaying, the punishment was that of a murderer, when the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> died under the blow of his master. If, however, the hurt was not certain, but only probable, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not impose any penalty as regards a man's own servant: for instance if the servant did not die at once after being struck, but after some days: for it would be uncertain whether he died as a result of the blows he received. For when a man struck a free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet so that he did not die at once, but "walked abroad again upon his staff," he that struck him was quit of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, even though afterwards he died. Nevertheless he was bound to pay the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor's</a> fees incurred by the victim of his assault. But this was not the case if a man killed his own servant: because whatever the servant had, even his very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, was the property of his master. Hence the reason for his not being subject to a pecuniary penalty is set down as being "because it is his money."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above (ad 1), no <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> could own a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> absolutely: but only in a restricted sense, as a hireling for a fixed time. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> permitted that through stress of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> a man might sell his son or daughter. This is shown by the very words of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, where we read: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sell his daughter to be a servant, she shall not go out as bondwomen are wont to go out." Moreover, in this way a man might sell not only his son, but even himself, rather as a hireling than as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, according to <a href="../bible/lev025.htm#verse39">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>: "If thy brother, constrained by <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a>, sell himself to thee, thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants: but he shall be as a hireling and a sojourner."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 9), the paternal authority has the power only of admonition; but not that of coercion, whereby rebellious and headstrong <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can be compelled. Hence in this case the Lord commanded the stubborn son to be punished by the rulers of the city.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The Lord forbade them to marry strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> on account of the danger of seduction, lest they should be led astray into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. And specially did this prohibition apply with respect to those nations who dwelt near them, because it was more probable that they would adopt their religious practices. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was willing to renounce <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and become an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, it was lawful to take her in marriage: as was the case with Ruth whom Booz <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>. Wherefore she said to her mother-in-<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<a href="../bible/rut001.htm#verse16">Ruth 1:16</a>): "Thy people shall be my people, and thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Accordingly it was not permitted to marry a captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> unless she first shaved her hair, and pared her nails, and put off the raiment wherein she was taken, and mourned for her father and mother, in token that she renounced <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> for ever.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xlviii super Matth.), "because death was an unmitigated <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, who did everything with a view to the present life, it was ordained that children should be born to the dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through his brother: thus affording a certain mitigation to his death. It was not, however, ordained that any other than his brother or one next of kin should marry the wife of the deceased, because" the offspring of this union "would not be looked upon as that of the deceased: and moreover, a stranger would not be under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to support the household of the deceased, as his brother would be bound to do from motives of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on account of his relationship." Hence it is evident that in marrying the wife of his dead brother, he took his dead brother's place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> The Law permitted a wife to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>, not as though it were just absolutely speaking, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>' hardness of heart, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> declared (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse8">Matthew 19:8</a>). Of this, however, we must speak more fully in the treatise on Matrimony (SP, 67).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> Wives break their conjugal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, both easily, for motives of pleasure, and hiddenly, since "the eye of the adulterer observeth darkness" (<a href="../bible/job024.htm#verse15">Job 24:15</a>). But this does not apply to a son in respect of his father, or to a servant in respect of his master: because the latter infidelity is not the result of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of pleasure, but rather of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: nor can it remain hidden like the infidelity of an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.
