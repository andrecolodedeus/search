<h1>Question 106. How one creature moves another</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1106.htm#article1"> Does one angel move the intellect of another by enlightenment?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1106.htm#article2"> Does one angel move the will of another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1106.htm#article3"> Can an inferior angel enlighten a superior angel?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1106.htm#article4"> Does a superior angel enlighten an inferior angel in all that he knows himself?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether one angel enlightens another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not enlighten another. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> possess now the same beatitude which we hope to obtain. But one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not then enlighten another, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse34">Jeremiah 31:34</a>: "They shall teach no more every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his neighbor, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his brother." Therefore neither does an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlighten another now.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, light in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is threefold; of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is enlightened in the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>; in the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the Justifier; in the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by the Beatifier; all of which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not enlighten another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, light is a form in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. But the rational mind is "informed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, without <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> intervention," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 51). Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not enlighten the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. viii) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are cleansed, enlightened and perfected by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens another. To make this clear, we must observe that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light is nothing else than a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse13">Ephesians 5:13</a>: "All that is made manifest is light." Hence to enlighten means nothing else but to communicate to others the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse8">Ephesians 3:8</a>): "To me the least of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is given this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> . . . to enlighten all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may see what is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which hath been hidden from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is said to enlighten another by manifesting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii): "Theologians plainly show that the orders of the heavenly beings are taught Divine science by the higher minds."

<p>Now since two things concur in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation, as we have said (105, 3), namely, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power, and the likeness of the thing understood; in both of these one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can notify the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to another.

<p>First, by strengthening his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power; for just as the power of an imperfect body is strengthened by the neighborhood of a more perfect body --for instance, the less hot is made hotter by the presence of what is hotter; so the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power of an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is strengthened by the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> turning to him: since in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, for one thing to turn to another, corresponds to neighborhood in corporeal things.

<p>Secondly, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> manifests the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to another as regards the likeness of the thing understood. For the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> receives the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by a kind of universal conception, to receive which the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not sufficiently powerful, for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him to receive <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a more particular manner. Therefore the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> distinguishes, in a way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he conceives universally, so that it can be grasped by the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; and thus he proposes it to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Thus it is with us that the teacher, in order to adapt himself to others, divides into many points the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which he possesses in the universal. This is thus expressed by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. xv): "Every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with provident power divides and multiplies the uniform <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> bestowed on it by one nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to lead its inferiors upwards by analogy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, both inferior and superior, see the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately, and in this respect one does not teach another. It is of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks; wherefore he adds: "They shall teach no more every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his brother, saying: '<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> the Lord': for all shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, from the least of them even to the greatest." But all the types of the Divine works, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in Himself, because He comprehends Himself; but of others who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the more types, the more perfectly he sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence a superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more about the types of the Divine works than an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and concerning these the former enlightens the latter; and as to this <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "are enlightened by the types of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not enlighten another by giving him the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but by strengthening his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light, and by manifesting to him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the state of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rational mind is formed immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either as the image from the exemplar, forasmuch as it is made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; or as the subject by the ultimate perfecting form: for the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> mind is always considered to be unformed, except it adhere to the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while the other kinds of enlightenment that proceed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, are, as it were, dispositions to this ultimate form.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one angel moves another angel's will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can move another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will. Because, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), as one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens another, so does he cleanse and perfect another. But cleansing and perfecting seem to belong to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for the former seems to point to the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which appertains to will; while to be perfected is to obtain an end, which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can move another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii): "The names of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> designate their properties." Now the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> are so called because they "kindle" or "give heat": and this is by love which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> moves another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 11) that the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the lower. But as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is higher, so also is his will. It seems, therefore, that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To him it belongs to change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to whom it belongs to bestow righteousness: for righteousness is the rightness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone bestows righteousness. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 105, Article 4), the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is changed in two ways; on the part of the object, and on the part of the power. On the part of the object, both the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> itself which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as the appetible moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and he who points out the object, as, for instance, one who proves something to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But as we have said above (Question 105, Article 4), other goods in a measure incline the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, yet nothing sufficiently moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> save the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> He alone shows, that it may be seen by the blessed, Who, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> asked: "Show me Thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>," answered: "I will show thee all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (<a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse18">Exodus 33:18-19</a>). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> sufficiently, either as the object or as showing the object. But he inclines the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as something lovable, and as manifesting some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ordered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. And thus he can incline the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the love of the creature or of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by way of persuasion.

<p>But on the part of the power the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be moved at all save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the operation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a certain inclination of the willer to the thing willed. And He alone can change this inclination, Who bestowed on the creature the power to will: just as that agent alone can change the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, which can give the power to which follows that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone gave to the creature the power to will, because He alone is the author of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot move another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Cleansing and perfecting are to be understood according to the mode of enlightenment. And since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enlightens by changing the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, He cleanses by removing defects of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, and perfects unto the end of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. But the enlightenment <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> concerns the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>); therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is to be understood as cleansing from the defect of nescience in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and as perfecting unto the consummae end of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and this is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. vi): that "in the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the chastening of the inferior <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is an enlightening of things unknown, that leads them to more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." For instance, we might say that corporeal sight is cleansed by the removal of darkness; enlightened by the diffusion of light; and perfected by being brought to the perception of the colored object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> One <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can induce another to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by persuasion as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of the lower sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which can be moved by the superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, because it belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and because the inferior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a power in a corporeal organ. But this does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an inferior angel can enlighten a superior angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can enlighten a superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> is derived from, and represents the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; and hence the heavenly Jerusalem is called "our mother" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians 4:26</a>). But in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even superiors are enlightened and taught by their inferiors, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 14:31</a>): "You may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted." Therefore, likewise in the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the superiors can be enlightened by inferiors.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also does the order of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But, as was said above (Question 105, Article 6), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes acts outside the order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore He also sometimes acts outside the order of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, by enlightening inferior otherwise than through their superiors. Therefore in that way the inferiors enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can enlighten superiors.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens the other to whom he turns, as was above explained (1). But since this turning to another is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can turn to the lowest passing over the others. Therefore he can enlighten him immediately; and thus the latter can enlighten his superiors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "this is the Divine unalterable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, that inferior things are led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the superior" (Coel. Hier. iv; Eccl. Hier. v).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> never enlighten the superior, but are always enlightened by them. The reason is, because, as above explained (105, 6), one order is under another, as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is under <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and hence as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is ordered to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so is order to order. Therefore there is no incongruity if sometimes anything is done outside the order of the inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, to be ordered to the superior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs the command of the president is passed over from obedience to the prince. So it happens that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> outside the order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that men may be ordered to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. But the passing over of the order that belongs to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in no way belongs to the ordering of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> operations are not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us; as are the operations of sensible bodies. Thus the order which belongs to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> is never passed over by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that the inferiors are always moved by the superior, and not conversely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> imitates the heavenly in some degree, but by a perfect likeness. For in the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the perfection of the order is in proportion to its nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that those who are the nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are the more sublime in grade, and more clear in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and on that account the superiors are never enlightened by the inferiors, whereas in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, sometimes those who are the nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in sanctity, are in the lowest grade, and are not conspicuous for science; and some also are eminent in one kind of science, and fail in another; and on that account superiors may be taught by inferiors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As above explained, there is no similarity between what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does outside the order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the argument does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> turns <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to enlighten another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is ever regulated by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> which made the order in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the superior angel enlightens the inferior as regards all he himself knows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not enlighten the inferior concerning all he himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xii) that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have a more universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and the inferior a more particular and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But more is contained under a universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than under a particular <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore not all that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the inferior, through these being enlightened by the former.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> (ii, D, 11) says that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had long <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, whereas the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it until it was accomplished. Thus we find that on some of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> inquiring, as it were, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: "Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?" other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, answered: "The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> expounds (Coel. Hier. vii). But this would not apply if the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enlightened the inferior concerning all they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves. Therefore they do not do so.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enlighten the inferior about all they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nothing that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> would be unknown to the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could communicate nothing more to the inferior; which appears open to objection. Therefore the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not enlighten the inferior in all things. 

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Sent. ii, D, ix; Cf. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Hom. xxxiv, in Ev.] says: "In that heavenly country, though there are some excellent <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, yet nothing is held individually." And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says: "Each heavenly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> communicates to the inferior the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> derived from the superior" (Coel. Hier. xv), as quoted above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every creature participates in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, so as to diffuse the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it possesses to others; for it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to communicate itself to others. Hence also corporeal agents give their likeness to others so far as they can. So the more an agent is established in the share of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, so much the more does it strive to transmit its perfections to others as far as possible. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Blessed Peter</a> admonishes those who by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> share in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; saying: "As every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, ministering the same one to another; as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stewards of the manifold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse10">1 Peter 4:10</a>). Much more therefore do the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who enjoy the plenitude of participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, impart the same to those below them.

<p>Nevertheless this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is not received so excellently by the inferior as by the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and therefore the superior ever remain in a higher order, and have a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; as the master understands the same thing better than the pupil who learns from him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is said to be more universal as regards the more eminent mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master's</a> words are not to be understood as if the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> but that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as fully as the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and that they progressed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it afterwards when the Mystery was accomplished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Till the Judgment Day some new things are always being <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, concerning the course of the world, and especially the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. Hence there is always something for the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the inferior.
