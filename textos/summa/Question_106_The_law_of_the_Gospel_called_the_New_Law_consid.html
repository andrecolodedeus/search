<h1>Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2106.htm#article1"> What kind of law is it? i.e. is it a written law or is it instilled in the heart?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2106.htm#article2"> Its efficacy, i.e. does it justify?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2106.htm#article3"> Its beginning: should it have been given at the beginning of the world?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2106.htm#article4"> Its end: i.e. will it last until the end, or will another law take its place?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the New Law is a written law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is just the same as the Gospel. But the Gospel is set forth in writing, according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse31">John 20:31</a>: "But these are written that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is instilled in the heart is the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14-15</a>: "(The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>) do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> . . . who have [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'show'] the work of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> written in their hearts." If therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel were instilled in our hearts, it would not be distinct from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel is proper to those who are in the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is instilled in the heart is common to those who are in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and to those who are in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse27">Wisdom 7:27</a>) that Divine Wisdom "through nations conveyeth herself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, she maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not instilled in our hearts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is instilled in our hearts. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, quoting the authority of <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>: "Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord; and I will perfect unto the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and unto the house of Judah, a new testament," says, explaining what this statement is (<a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse8">Hebrews 8:8-10</a>): "For this is the testament which I will make to the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> . . . by giving [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'I will give'] My laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is instilled in our hearts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "Each thing appears to be that which preponderates in it," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ix, 8). Now that which is preponderant in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and whereon all its efficacy is based, is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is chiefly the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is manifestly stated by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> who says (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse27">Romans 3:27</a>): "Where is . . . thy boasting? It is excluded. By what <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>? Of works? No, but by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>": for he calls the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> "a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." And still more clearly it is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the spirit of life, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, hath delivered me from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Lit. xxiv) that "as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> was written on tables of stone, so is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> inscribed on the hearts of the faithful": and elsewhere, in the same book (xxi): "What else are the Divine laws written by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself on our hearts, but the very presence of His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?"

<p>Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> contains certain things that dispose us to receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and pertaining to the use of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: such things are of secondary importance, so to speak, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; and the faithful need to be instructed concerning them, both by word and writing, both as to what they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and as to what they should do. Consequently we must say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is in the first place a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that is inscribed on our hearts, but that secondarily it is a written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Gospel writings contain only such things as pertain to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, either by disposing us thereto, or by directing us to the use thereof. Thus with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the Gospel contains certain matters pertaining to the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Godhead or humanity, which dispose us by means of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through which we receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and with regard to the affections, it contains matters touching the contempt of the world, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rendered fit to receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for "the world," i.e. worldly men, "cannot receive" the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse17">John 14:17</a>). As to the use of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, this consists in works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to which the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> exhort men in divers ways.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two ways in which a thing may be instilled into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. First, through being part of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is instilled into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Secondly, a thing is instilled into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by being, as it were, added on to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is instilled into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only by indicating to him what he should do, but also by helping him to accomplish it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever had the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> except through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> either explicit or implicit: and by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Consequently whoever had the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> instilled into them belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the New Law justifies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not justify. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified unless he obeys <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse9">Hebrews 5:9</a>: "He," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "became to all that obey Him the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." But the Gospel does not always <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it: for it is written (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse16">Romans 10:16</a>): "All do not obey the Gospel." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not justify.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves in his <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">epistle to the Romans</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> did not justify, because transgression increased at its advent: for it is stated (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse15">Romans 4:15</a>): "The Law worketh wrath: for where there is no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, neither is there transgression." But much more did the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> increase transgression: since he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after the giving of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> deserves greater punishment, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse28">Hebrews 10:28-29</a>: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> making void the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a> dieth without any mercy under two or three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden underfoot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," etc.? Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, does not justify.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, justification is an effect proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse33">Romans 8:33</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that justifieth." But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> just as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not justify any more than the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse16">Romans 1:16</a>): "I am not ashamed of the Gospel: for it is in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to everyone that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a>." But there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> but to those who are justified. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the Gospel justifies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), there is a twofold element in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the Gospel. There is the chief element, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> bestowed inwardly. And as to this, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> justifies. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Lit. xvii): "There," i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, "the Law was set forth in an outward fashion, that the ungodly might be afraid"; "here," i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, "it is given in an inward manner, that they may be justified." The other element of the Evangelical Law is secondary: namely, the teachings of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and those commandments which direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. And as to this, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not justify. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>) "The letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains this (De Spir. et Lit. xiv, xvii) by saying that the letter denotes any writing external to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even that of the moral precepts such as are contained in the Gospel. Wherefore the letter, even of the Gospel would kill, unless there were the inward presence of the healing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument holds <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, not as to its principal, but as to its secondary element: i.e. as to the dogmas and precepts outwardly put before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> either in words or in writing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> helps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet it does not so confirm <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for this belongs to the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence if a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after receiving the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, he deserves greater punishment, as being ungrateful for greater benefits, and as not using the help given to him. And this is why the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not said to "work wrath": because as far as it is concerned it gives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sufficient help to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave both the New and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, but in different ways. For He gave the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> written on tables of stone: whereas He gave the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> written "in the fleshly tables of the heart," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> expresses it (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>). Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Lit. xviii), "the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls this letter which is written outside <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a ministration of death and a ministration of condemnation: whereas he calls the other letter, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the ministration of the spirit and the ministration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: because through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> we work <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and are delivered from the condemnation due to transgression."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the New Law should have been given from the beginning of the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> should have been given from the beginning of the world. "For there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse11">Romans 2:11</a>). But "all" men "have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and do need the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans 3:23</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the Gospel should have been given from the beginning of the world, in order that it might bring succor to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as men dwell in various places, so do they live in various times. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "Who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>), commanded the Gospel to be preached in all places, as may be seen in the last chapters of <a href="../bible/mat028.htm">Matthew</a> and <a href="../bible/mar016.htm">Mark</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the Gospel should have been at hand for all times, so as to be given from the beginning of the world.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, more than to save his body, which is a temporal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provided <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning of the world with things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the health of his body, by subjecting to his power whatever was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26-29</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> also, which is very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, should have been given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning of the world.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>): "That was not first which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, but that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is highly <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Therefore it was not fitting for it to be given from the beginning of the world.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three reasons may be assigned why it was not fitting for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> to be given from the beginning of the world. The first is because the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), consists chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: which it behoved not to be given abundantly until <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, had been cast out of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through the accomplishment of his redemption by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a>): "As yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> was not given, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified." This reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states clearly (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2, seqq.</a>) where, after speaking of "the Law of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of life," he adds: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sending His own Son, in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hath condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, that the justification of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> might be fulfilled in us." <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, quoting perhaps from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, omits the "et" (and), after "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh." The text quoted should read thus: "in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh, and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offering (<em>peri hamartias</em>), hath," etc.</span>

<p>A second reason may be taken from the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Because a thing is not brought to perfection at once from the outset, but through an orderly succession of time; thus one is at first a boy, and then a man. And this reason is stated by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians 3:24-25</a>): "The Law was our pedagogue in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> that we might be justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But after the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue."

<p>The third reason is found in the fact that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: wherefore it behoved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> first of all to be left to himself under the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, so that through falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he might realize his weakness, and acknowledge his need of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This reason is set down by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a>): "The Law entered in, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound: and when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did more abound."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mankind on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents deserved to be deprived of the aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and so "from whom it is withheld it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> withheld, and to whom it is given, it is mercifully given," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Perfect. Justit. iv) [Cf. Ep. ccvii; De Pecc. Mer. et Rem. ii, 19. Consequently it does not follow that there is respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the fact that He did not offer the Law of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to all from the beginning of the world, which Law was to be published in due course of time, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> does not vary according to diversity of place, but according to succession of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> avails for all places, but not for all times: although at all times there have been some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things pertaining to the health of the body are of service to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as regards his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy: whereas things pertaining to the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are ordained to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is forfeit through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently the comparison will not hold.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the New Law will last till the end of the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> will not last until the end of the world. Because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>), "when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away." But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is "in part," since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>): "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part and we prophesy in part." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is to be done away, and will be succeeded by a more perfect state.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John 16:13</a>) promised His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter, should come. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not yet all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Therefore we must look forward to another state, wherein all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be revealed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as the Father is distinct from the Son and the Son from the Father, so is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> distinct from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But there was a state corresponding with the Person of the Father, viz. the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, wherein men were intent on begetting children: and likewise there is a state corresponding to the Person of the Son: viz. the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, wherein the clergy who are intent on wisdom (which is appropriated to the Son) hold a prominent place. Therefore there will be a third state corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> men will hold the first place.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse14">Matthew 24:14</a>): "This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world . . . and then shall the consummation come." But the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is already preached throughout the whole world: and yet the consummation has not yet come. Therefore the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Gospel of the kingdom, but another Gospel, that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is to come yet, like unto another Law.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse34">Matthew 24:34</a>): "I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all (these) things be done": which passage <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. lxxvii) explains as referring to "the generation of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore the state of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will last until the consummation of the world.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The state of the world may change in two ways. In one way, according to a change of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: and thus no other state will succeed this state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Because the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> succeeded the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as a more perfect <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a less perfect one. Now no state of the present life can be more perfect that the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: since nothing can approach nearer to the last end than that which is the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our being brought to the last end. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does this: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse19">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>): "Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the Holies by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a new . . . way which He hath dedicated for us . . . let us draw near." Therefore no state of the present life can be more perfect than that of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, since the nearer a thing is to the last end the more perfect it is.

<p>In another way the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> may change according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands in relation to one and the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> more or less perfectly. And thus the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> underwent frequent changes, since at times the laws were very well kept, and at other times were altogether unheeded. Thus, too, the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is subject to change with regard to various places, times, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more or less perfectly. Nevertheless we are not to look forward to a state wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to possess the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> more perfectly than he has possessed it hitherto, especially the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who "received the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, i.e. sooner and more abundantly than others," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans 8:23</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v), there is a threefold state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; the first was under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; the second is that of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; the third will take place not in this life, but in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. But as the first state is figurative and imperfect in comparison with the state of the Gospel; so is the present state figurative and imperfect in comparison with the heavenly state, with the advent of which the present state will be done away as expressed in that very passage (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix, 31), Montanus and Priscilla pretended that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> promise to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was fulfilled, not in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but in themselves. In like manner the Manicheans maintained that it was fulfilled in Manes whom they held to be the Paraclete. Hence none of the above received the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, where it is clearly shown that the aforesaid promise was fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> promised them a second time (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse5">Acts 1:5</a>): "You shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not many days hence": which we read as having been fulfilled in <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a>. However, these foolish notions are refuted by the statement (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a>) that "as yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> was not given, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified"; from which we gather that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given as soon as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was glorified in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>. Moreover, this puts out of court the senseless <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is to be expected to come at some other time.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> taught the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in respect of matters <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; those things, to wit, that we are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to do. But He did not teach them about all future events: for this did not regard them according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a>: "It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> corresponded not only to the Father, but also to the Son: because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was foreshadowed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John 5:46</a>): "If you did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would perhaps <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me also; for he wrote of Me." In like manner the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> corresponds not only to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a>: "The Law of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," etc. Hence we are not to look forward to another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said at the very outset of the preaching of the Gospel: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand" (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse17">Matthew 4:17</a>), it is most absurd to say that the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the Gospel of the kingdom. But the preaching of the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be understood in two ways. First, as denoting the spreading abroad of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ: and thus the Gospel was preached throughout the world even at the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> states (Hom. lxxv in Matth.). And in this sense the words that follow--"and then shall the consummation come," refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, of which He was speaking literally. Secondly, the preaching of the Gospel may be understood as extending throughout the world and producing its full effect, so that, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be founded in every nation. And in these sense, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> writes to Hesychius (Epist. cxcix), the Gospel is not preached to the whole world yet, but, when it is, the consummation of the world will come.
