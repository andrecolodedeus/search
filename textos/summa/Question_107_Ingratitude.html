<h1>Question 107. Ingratitude</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3107.htm#article1"> Is ingratitude always a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3107.htm#article2"> Is ingratitude a special sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3107.htm#article3"> Is every act of ingratitude a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3107.htm#article4"> Should favors be withdrawn from the ungrateful?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether ingratitude is always a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that ingratitude is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For Seneca says (De Benef. ii.) that "he who does not repay a favor is ungrateful." But sometimes it is impossible to repay a favor without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, for instance if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has helped another to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, since it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, it seems that ingratitude is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commits it: because, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. iii; Retract. i), "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid." Now sometimes it is not in the power of the sinner to avoid ingratitude, for instance when he has not the means of repaying. Again forgetfulness is not in our power, and yet Seneca declares (De Benef. ii.) that "to forget a kindness is the height of ingratitude." Therefore ingratitude is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there would seem to be no repayment in being unwilling to owe anything, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans 13:8</a>), "Owe no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> anything." Yet "an unwilling debtor is ungrateful," as Seneca declares (De Benef. iv). Therefore ingratitude is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Ingratitude is reckoned among other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse2">2 Timothy 3:2</a>), where it is written: "Disobedient to parents, ungrateful, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (106, 4, ad 1, 6) a debt of gratitude is a moral debt required by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a thing is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from the fact of its being contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore it is evident that every ingratitude is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Gratitude regards a favor received: and he that helps another to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does him not a favor but an injury: and so no thanks are due to him, except perhaps on account of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will, supposing him to have been deceived, and to have thought to help him in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereas he helped him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On such a case the repayment due to him is not that he should be helped to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because this would be repaying not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this is contrary to gratitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is excused from ingratitude through inability to repay, for the very reason that the mere will suffices for the repayment of the debt of gratitude, as stated above (106, 6, ad 1).

<p>Forgetfulness of a favor received amounts to ingratitude, not indeed the forgetfulness that arises from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect, that is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but that which arises from negligence. For, as Seneca observes (De Benef. ii.), "when forgetfulness of favors lays hold of a man, he has apparently given little thought to their repayment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The debt of gratitude flows from the debt of love, and from the latter no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should wish to be free. Hence that anyone should owe this debt unwillingly seems to arise from lack of love for his benefactor.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether ingratitude is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that ingratitude is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For whoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> acts against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his sovereign benefactor. But this pertains to ingratitude. Therefore ingratitude is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contained under different kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But one can be ungrateful by committing different kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, or something similar committed against a benefactor. Therefore ingratitude is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Seneca writes (De Benef. ii.): "It is ungrateful to take no notice of a kindness, it is ungrateful not to repay one, but it is the height of ingratitude to forget it." Now these do not seem to belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore ingratitude is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Ingratitude is opposed to gratitude or thankfulness, which is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is denominated from a deficiency of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because deficiency is more opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus illiberality is more opposed to liberality than prodigality is. Now a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may be opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of gratitude by way of excess, for instance if one were to show gratitude for things for which gratitude is not due, or sooner than it is due, as stated above (Question 106, Article 4). But still more opposed to gratitude is the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> denoting deficiency of gratitude, because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of gratitude, as stated above (Question 106, Article 6), inclines to return something more. Wherefore ingratitude is properly denominated from being a deficiency of gratitude. Now every deficiency or privation takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the opposite <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: for blindness and deafness differ according to the difference of sight and hearing. Therefore just as gratitude or thankfulness is one special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so also is ingratitude one special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>It has, however, various degrees corresponding in their order to the things required for gratitude. The first of these is to recognize the favor received, the second to express one's appreciation and thanks, and the third to repay the favor at a suitable place and time according to one's means. And since what is last in the order of generation is first in the order of destruction, it follows that the first degree of ingratitude is when a man fails to repay a favor, the second when he declines to notice or indicate that he has received a favor, while the third and supreme degree is when a man fails to recognize the reception of a favor, whether by forgetting it or in any other way. Moreover, since opposite affirmation includes negation, it follows that it belongs to the first degree of ingratitude to return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to the second to find fault with a favor received, and to the third to esteem kindness as though it were unkindness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is material ingratitude to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as a man does something that may pertain to ingratitude. But formal ingratitude is when a favor is actually contemned, and this is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders the formal aspect of some special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from being found materially in several kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in this way the aspect of ingratitude is to be found in many kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These three are not different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but different degrees of one special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether ingratitude is always a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that ingratitude is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For one ought to be grateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all. But one is not ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: else every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be guilty of ingratitude. Therefore no ingratitude is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal through being contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 24, Article 12). But ingratitude is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since the debt of gratitude proceeds from that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (106, 1, ad 3; 6, ad 2). Therefore ingratitude is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Seneca says (De Benef. ii): "Between the giver and the receiver of a favor there is this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, that the former should forthwith forget having given, and the latter should never forget having received." Now, seemingly, the reason why the giver should forget is that he may be unaware of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the recipient, should the latter <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> ungrateful; and there would be no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for that if ingratitude were a slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore ingratitude is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one should be put in the way of committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet, according to Seneca (De Benef. ii), "sometimes it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to deceive the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who receives assistance, in order that he may receive without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> from whom he has received." But this would seem to put the recipient in the way of ingratitude. Therefore ingratitude is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what we have said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a man may be ungrateful in two ways: first, by mere <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, for instance by failing to recognize the favor received, or to express his appreciation of it or to pay something in return, and this is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because, as stated above (Question 106, Article 6), the debt of gratitude requires a man to make a liberal return, which, however, he is not bound to do; wherefore if he fail to do so, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally. It is nevertheless a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it arises either from some kind of negligence or from some disinclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in him. And yet ingratitude of this kind may happen to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by reason either of inward contempt, or of the kind of thing withheld, this being needful to the benefactor, either simply, or in some case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p>Secondly, a man may be ungrateful, because he not only omits to pay the debt of gratitude, but does the contrary. This again is sometimes mortal and sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to the kind of thing that is done.

<p>It must be observed, however, that when ingratitude arises from a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it has the perfect character of ingratitude, and when it arises from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it has the imperfect character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By committing a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one is not ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the extent of incurring the guilt of perfect ingratitude: but there is something of ingratitude in a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it removes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act of obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When ingratitude is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is not contrary to, but beside <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: since it does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but excludes some act thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Seneca also says (De Benef. vii): "When we say that a man after conferring a favor should forget about it, it is a mistake to suppose that we mean him to shake off the recollection of a thing so very praiseworthy. When we say: He must not remember it, we mean that he must not publish it abroad and boast about it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> He that is unaware of a favor conferred on him is not ungrateful, if he fails to repay it, provided he be prepared to do so if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. It is nevertheless commendable at times that the object of a favor should remain in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of it, both in order to avoid vainglory, as when Blessed Nicolas threw gold into a house secretly, wishing to avoid popularity: and because the kindness is all the greater through the benefactor wishing not to shame the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom he is conferring the favor.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether favors should be withheld from the ungrateful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that favors should withheld from the ungrateful. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis016.htm#verse29">Wisdom 16:29</a>): "The hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's ice." But this hope would not melt away unless favors were withheld from him. Therefore favors should be withheld from the ungrateful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one should afford another an occasion of committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the ungrateful in receiving a favor is given an occasion of ingratitude. Therefore favors should not be bestowed on the ungrateful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "By what things a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also he is tormented" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse17">Wisdom 11:17</a>). Now he that is ungrateful when he receives a favor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the favor. Therefore he should be deprived of the favor.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse35">Luke 6:35</a>) that "the Highest . . . is kind to the unthankful, and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now we should <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> ourselves His children by imitating Him (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse36">Luke 6:36</a>). Therefore we should not withhold favors from the ungrateful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two points to be considered with regard to an ungrateful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The first is what he deserves to suffer and thus it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he deserves to be deprived of our favor. The second is, what ought his benefactor to do? For in the first place he should not easily judge him to be ungrateful, since, as Seneca remarks (De Benef. ii.), "a man is often grateful although he repays not," because perhaps he has not the means or the opportunity of repaying. Secondly, he should be inclined to turn his ungratefulness into gratitude, and if he does not achieve this by being kind to him once, he may by being so a second time. If, however, the more he repeats his favors, the more ungrateful and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the other becomes, he should cease from bestowing his favors upon him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted speaks of what the ungrateful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves to suffer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that bestows a favor on an ungrateful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> affords him an occasion not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but of gratitude and love. And if the recipient takes therefrom an occasion of ingratitude, this is not to be imputed to the bestower.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that bestows a favor must not at once act the part of a punisher of ingratitude, but rather that of a kindly physician, by healing the ingratitude with repeated favors.
