<h1>Question 107. The new law as compared with the old</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2107.htm#article1"> Is the New Law distinct from the Old Law?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2107.htm#article2"> Does the New Law fulfil the Old?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2107.htm#article3"> Is the New Law contained in the Old?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2107.htm#article4"> Which is the more burdensome, the New or the Old Law?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the New Law is distinct from the Old Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not distinct from the Old. Because both these laws were given to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since "without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of olden times and of nowadays is the same, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew 21:9</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is the same also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Adamant. Manich. discip. xvii) that "there is little difference between the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and Gospel" [The 'little difference' refers to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> words 'timor' and 'amor']--"fear and love." But the New and Old Laws cannot be differentiated in respect of these two things: since even the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> comprised precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor" (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus 19:18</a>), and: "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>" (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). In like manner neither can they differ according to the other difference which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> assigns (Contra Faust. iv, 2), viz. that "the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> contained temporal promises, whereas the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> promises": since even the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains temporal promises, according to <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse30">Mark 10:30</a>: He shall receive "a hundred times as much . . . in this time, houses and brethren," etc.: while in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> they hoped in promises <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse16">Hebrews 11:16</a>: "But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country," which is said of the patriarchs. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not distinct from the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> seems to distinguish both laws by calling the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> "a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of works," and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> "a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse27">Romans 3:27</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was also a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse39">Hebrews 11:39</a>: "All were [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'All these being'] approved by the testimony of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," which he says of the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of works: since it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>): "Do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you"; and (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>): "Do this for a commemoration of Me." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not distinct from the Old.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse12">Hebrews 7:12</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> being translated it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a translation also be made of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is distinct from that of the Old, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> shows in the same place. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is also distinct.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (90, 2; 91, 4), every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> ordains <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct to some end. Now things ordained to an end may be divided in two ways, considered from the point of view of the end. First, through being ordained to different ends: and this difference will be specific, especially if such ends are proximate. Secondly, by reason of being closely or remotely connected with the end. Thus it is clear that movements differ in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> through being directed to different terms: while according as one part of a movement is nearer to the term than another part, the difference of perfect and imperfect movement is assessed.

<p>Accordingly then two laws may be distinguished from one another in two ways. First, through being altogether diverse, from the fact that they are ordained to diverse ends: thus a state-<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> ordained to democratic government, would differ specifically from a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> ordained to government by the aristocracy. Secondly, two laws may be distinguished from one another, through one of them being more closely connected with the end, and the other more remotely: thus in one and the same state there is one <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> enjoined on men of mature age, who can forthwith accomplish that which pertains to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> regulating the education of children who need to be taught how they are to achieve manly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> later on.

<p>We must therefore say that, according to the first way, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: because they both have the same end, namely, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the New and of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse30">Romans 3:30</a>: "It is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that justifieth <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and uncircumcision through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." According to the second way, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is like a pedagogue of children, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians 3:24</a>), whereas the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of perfection, since it is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>) that it is "the bond of perfection."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> under both Testaments <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to the unity of end: for it has been stated above (Question 62, Article 2) that the object of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, among which is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is the last end. Yet <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had a different state in the Old and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: since what they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as future, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as fact.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All the differences assigned between the Old and New Laws are gathered from their relative perfection and imperfection. For the precepts of every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribe acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the imperfect, who as yet are not possessed of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, are directed in one way to perform <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts, while those who are perfected by the possession of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are directed in another way. For those who as yet are not endowed with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, are directed to the performance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts by reason of some outward <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for instance, by the threat of punishment, or the promise of some extrinsic rewards, such as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, or the like. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which was given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who were imperfect, that is, who had not yet received <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, was called the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of fear," inasmuch as it induced men to observe its commandments by threatening them with penalties; and is spoken of as containing temporal promises. On the other hand, those who are possessed of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, are inclined to do <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> through love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not on account of some extrinsic punishment or reward. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> which derives its pre-eminence from the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> instilled into our hearts, is called the "Law of love": and it is described as containing <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> promises, which are objects of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, chiefly of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Accordingly such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are inclined of themselves to those objects, not as to something foreign but as to something of their own. For this reason, too, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is described as "restraining the hand, not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>" [<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Sent. iii, D, 40; since when a man refrains from some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through fear of being punished, his will does not shrink simply from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a man who refrains from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through love of righteousness: and hence the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of love, is said to restrain the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Nevertheless there were some in the state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> who, having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, looked chiefly to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> promises: and in this respect they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. In like manner in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> there are some carnal men who have not yet attained to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; and these it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, even under the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, to lead to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> action by the fear of punishment and by temporal promises.

<p>But although the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained precepts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, nevertheless it did not confer the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by Whom "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> . . . is spread abroad in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (106, A1,2), the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in so far as its pre-eminence is derived from that very <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given inwardly to believers, and for this reason is called the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nevertheless it consists secondarily in certain <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, moral and sacramental: but the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not consist chiefly in these latter things, as did the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. As to those under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> who through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in this respect they belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: for they were not justified except through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is the Author of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Hence of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse26">Hebrews 11:26</a>) that he esteemed "the reproach of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> greater <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> than the treasure of the Egyptians."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the New Law fulfils the Old?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not fulfil the Old. Because to fulfil and to void are contrary. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> voids or excludes the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians 5:2</a>): "If you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall profit you nothing." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not a fulfilment of the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one contrary is not the fulfilment of another. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> propounded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> precepts that were contrary to precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For we read (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse27">Matthew 5:27-32</a>): You have heard that it was said to them of old: . . . "Whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, let him give her a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>. But I say to you that whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife . . . maketh her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>." Furthermore, the same evidently applies to the prohibition against swearing, against retaliation, and against hating one's enemies. In like manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> seems to have done away with the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> relating to the different kinds of foods (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>): "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not a fulfilment of the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever acts against a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in certain cases acted against the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For He touched the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse3">Matthew 8:3</a>), which was contrary to the Law. Likewise He seems to have frequently broken the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> used to say of Him (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse16">John 9:16</a>): "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who keepeth not the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: and so the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a fulfilment of the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained precepts, moral, ceremonial, and judicial, as stated above (Question 99, Article 4). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>) fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in some respects, but without mentioning the judicial and ceremonial precepts. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not a complete fulfilment of the Old.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew 5:17</a>): "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil": and went on to say (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse18">Matthew 5:18</a>): "One jot or one tittle shall not pass of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> till all be fulfilled."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is compared to the Old as the perfect to the imperfect. Now everything perfect fulfils that which is lacking in the imperfect. And accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> fulfils the Old by supplying that which was lacking in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p>Now two things of every <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to make men righteous and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, as was stated above (Question 92, Article 1): and consequently the end of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was the justification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The Law, however, could not accomplish this: but foreshadowed it by certain ceremonial actions, and promised it in words. And in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> fulfils the Old by justifying men through the power of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. This is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3-4</a>): "What the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> could not do . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sending His own Son in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh . . . hath condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, that the justification of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> might be fulfilled in us." And in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> gives what the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> promised, according to <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>: "Whatever are the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Him," i.e. in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "they are 'Yea'." [The <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> reads thus: "All the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are in Him, 'It is'."] Again, in this respect, it also fulfils what the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> foreshadowed. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse17">Colossians 2:17</a>) concerning the ceremonial precepts that they were "a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ"; in other words, the reality is found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of reality; whereas the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of shadow or of figure.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> fulfilled the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> both in His works and in His doctrine. In His works, because He was willing to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and to fulfil the other legal observances, which were binding for the time being; according to <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians 4:4</a>: "Made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." In His doctrine He fulfilled the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in three ways. First, by explaining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. This is clear in the case of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the prohibition of which the Scribes and Pharisees thought to refer only to the exterior act: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by showing that the prohibition extended also to the interior acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> fulfilled the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by prescribing the safest way of complying with the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> forbade perjury: and this is more safely avoided, by abstaining altogether from swearing, save in cases of urgency. Thirdly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> fulfilled the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, by adding some counsels of perfection: this is clearly seen in <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who affirmed that he had kept all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>: "One thing is wanting to thee: If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell whatsoever thou hast," etc. [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> combines <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a> with <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse21">Mark 10:21</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not void observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> except in the point of ceremonial precepts, as stated above (13, 3,4). Now the latter were figurative of something to come. Wherefore from the very fact that the ceremonial precepts were fulfilled when those things were accomplished which they foreshadowed, it follows that they are no longer to be observed: for it they were to be observed, this would mean that something is still to be accomplished and is not yet fulfilled. Thus the promise of a future <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> holds no longer when it has been fulfilled by the presentation of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. In this way the legal ceremonies are abolished by being fulfilled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix, 26), those precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> are not contrary to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> commanded about a man not putting away his wife, is not contrary to what the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> prescribed. "For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not say: 'Let him that wills, put his wife away': the contrary of which would be not to put her away. On the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was unwilling that a man should <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, since it prescribed a delay, so that excessive eagerness for <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> might cease through being weakened during the writing of the bill. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, in order to impress the fact that a wife ought not easily to be put away, allowed no exception save in the case of fornication." The same applies to the prohibition about swearing, as stated above. The same is also clear with respect to the prohibition of retaliation. For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> fixed a limit to revenge, by forbidding men to seek vengeance unreasonably: whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> deprived them of vengeance more completely by commanding them to abstain from it altogether. With regard to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's enemies, He dispelled the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, by admonishing us to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. As to discriminating between various foods, which was a ceremonial <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not forbid this to be observed: but He showed that no foods are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, but only in token of something else, as stated above (102, 6, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It was forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to touch a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>; because by doing so, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incurred a certain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>, as also by touching the dead, as stated above (102, 5, ad 4). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, Who healed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, could not contract an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. By those things which He did on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, He did not break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> in reality, as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master Himself</a> shows in the Gospel: both because He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by His Divine power, which is ever active among things; and because He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by His Divine power, which is ever active among things; and because His works were concerned with the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while the Pharisees were concerned for the well-being of animals even on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; and again because on account of urgency He excused His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for gathering the ears of corn on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. But He did seem to break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who thought that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to abstain from doing even works of kindness on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; which was contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The reason why the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are not mentioned in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a> is because, as stated above (ad 1), their observance was abolished by their fulfilment. But of the judicial precepts He mentioned that of retaliation: so that what He said about it should refer to all the others. With regard to this precept, He taught that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was that retaliation should be sought out of love of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and not as a punishment out of revengeful spite, which He forbade, admonishing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be ready to suffer yet greater insults; and this remains still in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the New Law is contained in the Old?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not contained in the Old. Because the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: wherefore it is called the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse27">Romans 3:27</a>). But many points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are set forth in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which are not contained in the Old. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not contained in the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew 5:19</a>, "He that shall break one of these least commandments," that the lesser commandments are those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and the greater commandments, those contained in the Gospel. Now the greater cannot be contained in the lesser. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not contained in the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, who holds the container holds the contents. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is contained in the Old, it follows that whoever had the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had the New: so that it was superfluous to give men a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> when once they had the Old. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not contained in the Old.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As expressed in <a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse16">Ezekiel 1:16</a>, there was "a wheel in the midst of a wheel," i.e. "the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> within the Old," according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> exposition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> One thing may be contained in another in two ways. First, actually; as a located thing is in a place. Secondly, virtually; as an effect in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or as the complement in that which is incomplete; thus a genus contains its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and a seed contains the whole tree, virtually. It is in this way that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is contained in the Old: for it has been stated (1) that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is compared to the Old as perfect to imperfect. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, expounding <a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse28">Mark 4:28</a>, "The earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear," expresses himself as follows: "He brought forth first the blade, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; then the ear, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>; lastly, the full corn, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> of the Gospel." Hence then the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is in the Old as the corn in the ear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatsoever is set down in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> explicitly and openly as a point of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is contained in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as a matter of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but implicitly, under a figure. And accordingly, even as to those things which we are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is contained in the Old.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are said to be greater than those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, in the point of their being set forth explicitly. But as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, they are all contained in the Old. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xix, 23,28) that "nearly all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> admonitions or precepts, where He expressed Himself by saying: 'But I say unto you,' are to be found also in those ancient books. Yet, since they thought that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was only the slaying of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> declared to them that every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> impulse to hurt our brother is to be looked on as a kind of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>." And it is in the point of declarations of this kind that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are said to be greater than those of the Old. Nothing, however, prevents the greater from being contained in the lesser virtually; just as a tree is contained in the seed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What is set forth implicitly needs to be declared explicitly. Hence after the publishing of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> also had to be given.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the New Law is more burdensome than the Old?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more burdensome than the Old. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Opus Imp. in Matth., Hom. x [The work of an unknown author]) say: "The commandments given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> are easy to obey: Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: but the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are difficult to accomplish, for instance: Thou shalt not give way to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more burdensome than the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is easier to make use of earthly prosperity than to suffer tribulations. But in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> was followed by temporal prosperity, as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>; whereas many kinds of trouble ensue to those who observe the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>: "Let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses," etc. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more burdensome than the Old.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> The more one has to do, the more difficult it is. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is something added to the Old. For the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> forbade perjury, while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> proscribed even swearing: the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> forbade a man to cast off his wife without a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> forbade <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> altogether; as is clearly stated in <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse31">Matthew 5:31</a>, seqq., according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> expounding. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more burdensome than the Old.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew 11:28</a>): "Come to Me, all you that labor and are burdened": which words are expounded by <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> thus: "He calls to Himself all those that labor under the difficulty of observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and are burdened with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of this world." And further on He says of the yoke of the Gospel: "For My yoke is sweet and My burden light." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is a lighter burden than the Old.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A twofold difficult may attach to works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with which the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are concerned. One is on the part of the outward works, which of themselves are, in a way, difficult and burdensome. And in this respect the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> is a much heavier burden than the New: since the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> by its numerous ceremonies prescribed many more outward acts than the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which, in the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, added very few precepts to those of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; although afterwards some were added, through being instituted by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. Even in these <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that moderation should be observed, lest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conduct should become a burden to the faithful. For he says in reply to the queries of Januarius (Ep. lv) that, "whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mercy wished religion to be a free service rendered by the public solemnization of a small number of most manifest <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> make it a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave's</a> burden; so much so that the state of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who were subject to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and not to the presumptuous devices of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was more tolerable."

<p>The other difficulty attaches to works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as to interior acts: for instance, that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> be done with promptitude and pleasure. It is this difficulty that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> solves: because to act thus is difficult for a man without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it becomes easy for him. In this respect the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are more burdensome than those of the Old; because the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> prohibits certain interior movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which were not expressly forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> in all cases, although they were forbidden in some, without, however, any punishment being attached to the prohibition. Now this is very difficult to a man without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 9) that it is easy to do what a righteous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does; but that to do it in the same way, viz. with pleasure and promptitude, is difficult to a man who is not righteous. Accordingly we read also (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse3">1 John 5:3</a>) that "His commandments are not heavy": which words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds by saying that "they are not heavy to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that loveth; whereas they are a burden to him that loveth not."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted speaks expressly of the difficulty of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> as to the deliberate curbing of interior movements.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The tribulations suffered by those who observe the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are not imposed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> itself. Moreover they are easily borne, on account of the love in which the same Law consists: since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxx), "love makes light and nothing of things that seem arduous and beyond our power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of these additions to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was to render it easier to do what it prescribed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states [De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 17,21; xix, 23,26. Accordingly this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more burdensome, but rather that it is a lighter burden.
