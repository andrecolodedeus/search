<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether one angel speaks to another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to another. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xviii) that, in the state of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> "each one's body will not hide his mind from his fellows." Much less, therefore, is one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mind hidden from another. But speech manifests to another what lies hidden in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> should speak to another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, speech is twofold; interior, whereby one speaks to oneself; and exterior, whereby one speaks to another. But exterior speech takes place by some sensible sign, as by voice, or gesture, or some bodily member, as the tongue, or the fingers, and this cannot apply to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the speaker incites the hearer to listen to what he says. But it does not appear that one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> incites another to listen; for this happens among us by some sensible sign. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>): "If I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak in a certain way. But, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii): "It is fitting that our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, rising above the properties of bodily speech, should be lifted to the sublime and unknown methods of interior speech."

<p>To understand how one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks to another, we must consider that, as we explained above (Question 82, Article 4), when treating of the actions and powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to its operation. Now an intelligible object is present to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in three ways; first, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 6,7); secondly, as actually considered or conceived; thirdly, as related to something else. And it is clear that the intelligible object passes from the first to the second stage by the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and hence in the definition of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> these words occur, "which anyone uses when he wills." So likewise the intelligible object passes from the second to the third stage by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> the concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is ordered to something else, as, for instance, either to the performing of an action, or to being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another. Now when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> turns itself to the actual consideration of any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> speaks to himself; for the concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is called "the interior word." And by the fact that the concept of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> mind is ordered to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> himself, the concept of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another; and in this way one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks to another; for to speak to another only means to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept is hidden by a twofold obstacle. The first is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which can retain the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept within, or can direct it externally. In this way <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can see the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of another, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>: "What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him?" The other obstacle whereby the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept is excluded from another one's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, comes from the body; and so it happens that even when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directs the concept of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to make itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it is not at once make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another; but some sensible sign must be used. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> alludes to this fact when he says (Moral. ii): "To other eyes we seem to stand aloof as it were behind the wall of the body; and when we wish to make ourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, we go out as it were by the door of the tongue to show what we really are." But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is under no such obstacle, and so he can make his concept <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another at once.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> External speech, made by the voice, is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for us on account of the obstacle of the body. Hence it does not befit an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but only interior speech belongs to him, and this includes not only the interior speech by <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept, but also its being ordered to another's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. So the tongue of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called metaphorically the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power, whereby he manifests his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no need to draw the attention of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, inasmuch as they always see each other in the Word; for as one ever sees the other, so he ever sees what is ordered to himself. But because by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they can speak to each other, and even now the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak to each other, we must say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved by the intelligible object just as sense is affected by the sensible object. Therefore, as sense is aroused by the sensible object, so the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be aroused to attention by some intelligible power.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the inferior angel speaks to the superior?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to the superior. For on the text (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), "If I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> remarks that the speech of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is an enlightenment whereby the superior enlightens the inferior. But the inferior never enlightens the superior, as was above explained (106, 3). Therefore neither do the inferior speak to the superior.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as was said above (Question 106, Article 1), to enlighten means merely to acquaint one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another; and this is to speak. Therefore to speak and to enlighten are the same; so the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaks to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by the very fact that He shows to their hearts His hidden and invisible things." But this is to enlighten them. Therefore, whenever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaks, He enlightens. In the same way every <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech is an enlightening. Therefore an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can in no way speak to a superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the exposition of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said to the superior: "Who is this King of Glory?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can speak to the superior. To make this clear, we must consider that every <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> enlightening is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech; but on the other hand, not every speech is an enlightening; because, as we have said (1), for one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to speak to another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> means nothing else, but that by his own will he directs his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept in such a way, that it becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the other. Now what the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> conceives may be reduced to a twofold principle; to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Who is the primal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one who understands, whereby we actually consider anything. But because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the light of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the rule of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the manifestation of what is conceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as depending on the primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is both speech and enlightenment; for example, when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> says to another: "Heaven was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; or, "Man is an animal." The manifestation, however, of what depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one who understands, cannot be called an enlightenment, but is only a speech; for instance, when one says to another: "I wish to learn this; I wish to do this or that." The reason is that the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not a light, nor a rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but participates of light. Hence to communicate what comes from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not, as such, an enlightening. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you may will, or what you may understand does not belong to the perfection of my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but only to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in reality.

<p>Now it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are called superior or inferior by comparison with this principle, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore enlightenment, which depends on the principle which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is conveyed only by the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the inferior. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as the principle, he who wills is first and supreme; and therefore the manifestation of what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, is conveyed to others by the one who wills. In that manner both the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak to the inferior, and the inferior speak to the superior.

<p>From this clearly appear the replies to the first and second objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every speech of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is an enlightening; because since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it belongs to the perfection and enlightenment of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills. But the same does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as was explained above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angel speaks to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For speech makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> something to another. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> anything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to speak is to order the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept in reference to another, as was shown above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ever orders his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he ever speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which in some ways appears to be unreasonable, since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sometimes speaks to another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore it seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> never speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse12">Zechariah 1:12</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord answered and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem." Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (1,2), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks by ordering his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept to something else. Now one thing is ordered to another in a twofold manner. In one way for the purpose of giving one thing to another, as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the agent is ordered to the patient, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech the teacher is ordered to the learner; and in this sense an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in no way speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either of what concerns the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or of whatever depends on the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> will; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principle and source of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and of all will. In another way one thing is ordered to another to receive something, as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the passive is ordered to the agent, and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech the disciple to the master; and in this way an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either by consulting the Divine will of what ought to be done, or by admiring the Divine excellence which he can never comprehend; thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when by contemplating what is above themselves they rise to emotions of admiration."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Speech is not always for the purpose of making something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another; but is sometimes finally ordered to the purpose of manifesting something to the speaker himself; as when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> ask instruction from the master.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are ever speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sense of praising and admiring Him and His works; but they speak to Him by consulting Him about what ought to be done whenever they have to perform any new work, concerning which they desire enlightenment.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether local distance influences the angelic speech?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that local distance affects the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech. For as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 13): "An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> works where he is." But speech is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> operation. Therefore, as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is in a determinate place, it seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> speech is limited by the bounds of that place.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a speaker cries out on account of the distance of the hearer. But it is said of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> that "they cried one to another" (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a>). Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech local distance has some effect.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said that the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, notwithstanding the local distance (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse24">Luke 16:24</a>). Much less therefore does local distance impede the speech of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech consists in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation, as explained above (1,2,3). And the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> abstracts from the "here and now." For even our own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation takes place by abstraction from the "here and now," except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> on the part of the phantasms, which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at all in an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. But as regards whatever is abstracted from "here and now," neither difference of time nor local distance has any influence whatever. Hence in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech local distance is no impediment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech, as above explained (1, ad 2), is interior; perceived, nevertheless, by another; and therefore it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who speaks, and consequently where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is who speaks. But as local distance does not prevent one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> seeing another, so neither does it prevent an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> perceiving what is ordered to him on the part of another; and this is to perceive his speech.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The cry mentioned is not a bodily voice raised by reason of the local distance; but is taken to signify the magnitude of what is said, or the intensity of the affection, according to what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii): "The less one desires, the less one cries out."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether all the angels know what one speaks to another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what one speaks to another. For unequal local distance is the reason why all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> says to another. But in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> speech local distance has no effect, as above explained (4). Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what one speaks to another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power in common. So if the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept of one ordered to another is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by one, it is for the same reason <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by all.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, enlightenment is a kind of speech. But the enlightenment of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by another extends to all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xv): "Each one of the heavenly beings communicates what he learns to the others." Therefore the speech of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to another extends to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can speak to another alone; much more can this be the case among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (1,2), the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be perceived by another when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who possesses the concept refers it by his will to another. Now a thing can be ordered through some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to one thing and not to another; consequently the concept of one (<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>) may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by one and not by another; and therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can perceive the speech of one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to another; whereas others do not, not through the obstacle of local distance, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> so ordering, as explained above.

<p>From this appear the replies to the first and second objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Enlightenment is of those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that emanate from the first rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is the principle common to all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and in that way all enlightenments are common to all. But speech may be of something ordered to the principle of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> will, which is proper to each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; and in this way it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that these speeches should be common to all.
