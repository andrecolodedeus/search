<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all the angels are of one hierarchy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. For since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are supreme among creatures, it is evident that they are ordered for the best. But the best ordering of a multitude is for it to be governed by one authority, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10; Polit. iii, 4). Therefore as a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is nothing but a sacred principality, it seems that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iii) that "hierarchy is order, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and action." But all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> agree in one order towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and by Whom in their actions they are ruled. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belong to one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the sacred principality called <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is to be found among men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Therefore likewise all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vi) distinguishes three hierarchies of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Hierarchy means a "sacred" principality, as above explained. Now principality includes two things: the prince himself and the multitude ordered under the prince. Therefore because there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Prince not only of all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and all creatures; so there is one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, not only of all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but also of all rational creatures, who can be participators of sacred things; according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xii, 1): "There are two cities, that is, two societies, one of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, the other of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." But if we consider the principality on the part of the multitude ordered under the prince, then principality is said to be "one" accordingly as the multitude can be subject in "one" way to the government of the prince. And those that cannot be governed in the same way by a prince belong to different principalities: thus, under one king there are different cities, which are governed by different laws and administrators. Now it is evident that men do not receive the Divine enlightenments in the same way as do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> receive them in their intelligible purity, whereas men receive them under sensible signs, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i). Therefore there must needs be a distinction between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. In the same manner we distinguish three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> hierarchies. For it was shown above (Question 55, Article 3), in treating of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have a more universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has three grades among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the types of things, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are enlightened, can be considered in a threefold manner.

<p>First as preceding from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the first universal principle, which mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, connected immediately with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, "as it were, placed in the vestibule of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii).

<p>Secondly, forasmuch as these types depend on the universal <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which in some way are already multiplied; which mode belongs to the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.

<p>Thirdly, forasmuch as these types are applied to particular things as depending on their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; which mode belongs to the lowest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. All this will appear more clearly when we treat of each of the orders (6). In this way are the hierarchies distinguished on the part of the multitude of subjects.

<p>Hence it is clear that those <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> and speak against the opinion of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> who place a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the Divine Persons, and call it the "supercelestial" <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. For in the Divine Persons there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, indeed, a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, but there is no <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> order, for as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iii): "The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> order is so directed that some be cleansed, enlightened, and perfected; and that others cleanse, enlighten, and perfect"; which far be it from us to apply to the Divine Persons.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection considers principality on the part of the ruler, inasmuch as a multitude is best ruled by one ruler, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts in those passages.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Whom all see in one way--that is, in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>--there is no <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> distinction among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but there is such a distinction as regards the types of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All men are of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and have one connatural mode of understanding; which is not the case in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: and hence the same argument does not apply to both.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are several orders in one hierarchy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> there are not several orders. For when a definition is multiplied, the thing defined is also multiplied. But <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is order, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iii). Therefore, if there are many orders, there is not one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> only, but many.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different orders are different grades, and grades among spirits are constituted by different <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. But among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> all the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are common to all, for "nothing is possessed individually" (Sent. ii, D, ix). Therefore there are not different orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> the orders are distinguished according to the actions of "cleansing," "enlightening," and "perfecting." For the order of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> is "cleansing," the order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, is "enlightening," and of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "perfecting," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Eccl. Hier. v). But each of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cleanses, enlightens, and perfects. Therefore there is no distinction of orders among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse20">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has set the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> above all principality and power, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and dominion": which are the various orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and some of them belong to one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, as will be explained (6).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As explained above, one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is one principality--that is, one multitude ordered in one way under the rule of a prince. Now such a multitude would not be ordered, but confused, if there were not in it different orders. So the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> requires diversity of orders.

<p>This diversity of order arises from the diversity of offices and actions, as appears in one city where there are different orders according to the different actions; for there is one order of those who judge, and another of those who fight, and another of those who labor in the fields, and so forth.

<p>But although one city thus comprises several orders, all may be reduced to three, when we consider that every multitude has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So in every city, a threefold order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is to be seen, some of whom are supreme, as the nobles; others are the last, as the common people, while others hold a place between these, as the middle-class [populus honorabilis]. In the same way we find in each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the orders distinguished according to their actions and offices, and all this diversity is reduced to three--namely, to the summit, the middle, and the base; and so in every hierarchy <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> places three orders (Coel. Hier. vi).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Order is twofold. In one way it is taken as the order comprehending in itself different grades; and in that way a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is called an order. In another way one grade is called an order; and in that sense the several orders of one <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are so called.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All things are possessed in common by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> society, some things, however, being held more excellently by some than by others. Each <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is more perfectly possessed by the one who can communicate it, than by the one who cannot communicate it; as the hot thing which can communicate heat is more perfect that what is unable to give heat. And the more perfectly anyone can communicate a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, the higher grade he occupies, as he is in the more perfect grade of mastership who can teach a higher science. By this similitude we can reckon the diversity of grades or orders among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to their different offices and actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is superior to the highest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of our <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, according to the words, "He that is the lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, is greater than he"--namely, <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, than whom "there hath not risen a greater among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>). Hence the lesser <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> can not only cleanse, but also enlighten and perfect, and in a higher way than can the orders of our <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Thus the heavenly orders are not distinguished by reason of these, but by reason of other different acts.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there are many angels in one order?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there are not many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in one order. For it was shown above (Question 50, Article 4), that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are unequal. But equals belong to one order. Therefore there are not many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in one order.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is superfluous for a thing to be done by many, which can be done sufficiently by one. But that which belongs to one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> office can be done sufficiently by one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; so much more sufficiently than the one sun does what belongs to the office of the sun, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is more perfect than a heavenly body. If, therefore, the orders are distinguished by their offices, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in one order would be superfluous.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was said above (Objection 1) that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are unequal. Therefore, if several <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (for instance, three or four), are of one order, the lowest one of the superior order will be more akin to the highest of the inferior order than with the highest of his own order; and thus he does not seem to be more of one order with the latter than with the former. Therefore there are not many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of one order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "The <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> cried to one another" (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a>). Therefore there are many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the one order of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything perfectly, is able to distinguish its acts, powers, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, down to the minutest details, whereas he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing in an imperfect manner can only distinguish it in a general way, and only as regards a few points. Thus, one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things imperfectly, can distinguish their orders in a general way, placing the heavenly bodies in one order, inanimate inferior bodies in another, plants in another, and animals in another; whilst he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things perfectly, is able to distinguish different orders in the heavenly bodies themselves, and in each of the other orders.

<p>Now our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is imperfect, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vi). Hence we can only distinguish the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices and orders in a general way, so as to place many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in one order. But if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the offices and distinctions of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> perfectly, we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly that each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has his own office and his own order among things, and much more so than any star, though this be hidden from us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of one order are in some way equal in a common similitude, whereby they are placed in that order; but absolutely speaking they are not equal. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. x) that in one and the same order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there are those who are first, middle, and last.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That special distinction of orders and offices wherein each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has his own office and order, is hidden from us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As in a surface which is partly white and partly black, the two parts on the borders of white and black are more akin as regards their position than any other two white parts, but are less akin in <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; so two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are on the boundary of two orders are more akin in propinquity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than one of them is akin to the others of its own order, but less akin in their fitness for similar offices, which fitness, indeed, extends to a definite limit.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the distinction of hierarchies and orders comes from the angelic nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the distinction of hierarchies and of orders is not from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is "a sacred principality," and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> places in its definition that it "approaches a resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as may be" (Coel. Hier. iii). But sanctity and resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the distinction of hierarchies and orders in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> are called "burning" or "kindling," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii). This belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which comes not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for "it is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>): "which is said not only of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, but also of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders are not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> is copied from the heavenly. But the orders among men are not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for it is not a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> for one to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and another a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and another a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Therefore neither in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the orders from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> only.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (ii, D. 9) that "an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> order is a multitude of heavenly spirits, who are likened to each other by some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, just as they agree also in the participation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Therefore the distinction of orders among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is not only by <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The order of government, which is the order of a multitude under authority, is derived from its end. Now the end of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be considered in two ways.

<p>First, according to the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and love; and according to their relation to this end the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinguished by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p>Secondly, the end of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> multitude can be taken from what is above their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, which consists in the vision of the Divine Essence, and in the unchangeable fruition of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; to which end they can reach only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and hence as regards this end, the orders in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are adequately distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but dispositively by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, forasmuch as to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are given gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to the capacity of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>; which is not the case with men, as above explained (62, 6). Hence among men the orders are distinguished according to the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> only, and not according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p>From the above the replies to the objections are evident.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the orders of the angels are properly named?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not properly named. For all the heavenly spirits are called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and heavenly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But common names should not be appropriated to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Therefore the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are ineptly named.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to be Lord, according to the words, "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> ye that the Lord He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa099.htm#verse3">Psalm 99:3</a>). Therefore one order of the heavenly spirits is not properly called "Dominations."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the name "Domination" seems to imply government and likewise the names "Principalities" and "Powers." Therefore these three names do not seem to be properly applied to three orders.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, archangels are as it were <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> princes. Therefore this name ought not to be given to any other order than to the "Principalities."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the name "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" is derived from ardor, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and the name "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> common to all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore they ought not to be names of any particular orders.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, Thrones are seats. But from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves the rational creature He is said to sit within it. Therefore there ought not to be any order of "Thrones" besides the "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>." Therefore it appears that the orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not properly styled.

<p><strong>On the contrary</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a> wherein they are so named. For the name "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" is found in <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse2">Isaiah 6:2</a>; the name "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" in <a href="../bible/eze001.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> (Cf. <a href="../bible/eze010.htm#verse15">10:15-20</a>); "Thrones" in <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians 1:16</a>; "Dominations," "Virtues," "Powers," and "Principalities" are mentioned in <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians 1:21</a>; the name "Archangels" in the <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse9">canonical epistle of St. Jude (9)</a>, and the name "Angels" is found in many places of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii), in the names of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe that the proper name of each order expresses its property. Now to see what is the property of each order, we must consider that in coordinated things, something may be found in a threefold manner: by way of property, by way of excess, and by way of participation. A thing is said to be in another by way of property, if it is adequate and proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: by excess when an attribute is less than that to which it is attributed, but is possessed thereby in an eminent manner, as we have stated (13, 2) concerning all the names which are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: by participation, when an attribute is possessed by something not fully but partially; thus <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are called gods by participation. Therefore, if anything is to be called by a name designating its property, it ought not to be named from what it participates imperfectly, nor from that which it possesses in excess, but from that which is adequate thereto; as, for instance, when we wish properly to name a man, we should call him a "rational <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," but not an "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," which latter is the proper name of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; because simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> belongs to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as a property, and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by participation; nor do we call him a "sensible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," which is the proper name of a brute; because sense is less than the property of a man, and belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a more excellent way than to other animals.

<p>So we must consider that in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfections are common to all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that they are all more excellently in the superior than in the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Further, as in these perfections there are grades, the superior perfection belongs to the superior order as its property, whereas it belongs to the inferior by participation; and conversely the inferior perfection belongs to the inferior order as its property, and to the superior by way of excess; and thus the superior order is denominated from the superior perfection.

<p>So in this way <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii) explains the names of the orders accordingly as they befit the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> perfections they signify. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, on the other hand, in expounding these names (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.) seems to regard more the exterior ministrations; for he says that "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are so called as announcing the least things; and the archangels in the greatest; by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought; by the powers hostile powers are repulsed; and the principalities preside over the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirits themselves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Angel means "messenger." So all the heavenly spirits, so far as they make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Divine things, are called "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." But the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enjoy a certain excellence, as regards this manifestation, from which the superior orders are denominated. The lowest order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> possess no excellence above the common manifestation; and therefore it is denominated from manifestation only; and thus the common name remains as it were proper to the lowest order, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. v). Or we may say that the lowest order can be specially called the order of "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>," forasmuch as they announce things to us immediately. "Virtue" can be taken in two ways.

<p>First, commonly, considered as the medium between the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and the operation, and in that sense all the heavenly spirits are called heavenly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as also "heavenly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>."

<p>Secondly, as meaning a certain excellence of strength; and thus it is the proper name of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> order. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the "name '<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>' signifies a certain virile and immovable strength"; first, in regard of those Divine operations which befit them; secondly, in regard to receiving Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Thus it signifies that they undertake fearlessly the Divine behests appointed to them; and this seems to imply strength of mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xii): "Dominion is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a special manner, by way of excess: but the Divine word gives the more illustrious heavenly princes the name of Lord by participation, through whom the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> receive the Divine <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> also states (Coel. Hier. viii) that the name "Domination" means first "a certain liberty, free from servile <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> and common subjection, such as that of plebeians, and from tyrannical oppression," endured sometimes even by the great.

<p>Secondly, it signifies "a certain rigid and inflexible supremacy which does not bend to any servile act, or to the act, of those who are subject to or oppressed by tyrants."

<p>Thirdly, it signifies "the desire and participation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> dominion which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Likewise the name of each order signifies the participation of what belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as the name "Virtues" signifies the participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the same principle applies to the rest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The names "Domination," "Power," and "Principality" belong to government in different ways. The place of a lord is only to prescribe what is to be done. So <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxiv in Evang.), that "some companies of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because others are subject to obedience to them, are called dominations." The name "Power" points out a kind of order, according to what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans 13:2</a>). And so <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the name "Power" signifies a kind of ordination both as regards the reception of Divine things, and as regards the Divine actions performed by superiors towards inferiors by leading them to things above. Therefore, to the order of "Powers" it belongs to regulate what is to be done by those who are subject to them. To preside [principari] as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) is "to be first among others," as being first in carrying out what is ordered to be done. And so <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ix) that the name of "Principalities" signifies "one who leads in a sacred order." For those who lead others, being first among them, are properly called "princes," according to the words, "Princes went before joined with singers" (<a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse26">Psalm 67:26</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The "Archangels," according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. ix), are between the "Principalities" and the "Angels." A medium compared to one extreme seems like the other, as participating in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of both extremes; thus tepid seems cold compared to hot, and hot compared to cold. So the "Archangels" are called the "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> princes"; forasmuch as they are princes as regards the "Angels," and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as regards the Principalities. But according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) they are called "Archangels," because they preside over the one order of the "Angels"; as it were, announcing greater things: and the "Principalities" are so called as presiding over all the heavenly "Virtues" who fulfil the Divine commands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The name "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" does not come from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> only, but from the excess of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, expressed by the word ardor or fire. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds the name "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" according to the properties of fire, containing an excess of heat. Now in fire we may consider three things.

<p>First, the movement which is upwards and continuous. This signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, the active force which is "heat," which is not found in fire simply, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> with a certain sharpness, as being of most penetrating action, and reaching even to the smallest things, and as it were, with superabundant fervor; whereby is signified the action of these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them, rousing them to a like fervor, and cleansing them wholly by their heat.

<p>Thirdly we consider in fire the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have in themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they also perfectly enlighten others.

<p>In the same way the name "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" comes from a certain excess of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence it is interpreted "fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," which <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds in regard to four things: the perfect <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>; the full reception of the Divine Light; their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the beauty of the Divine order; and in regard to the fact that possessing this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> fully, they pour it forth copiously upon others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> The order of the "Thrones" excels the inferior orders as having an immediate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the types of the Divine works; whereas the "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" have the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" the excellence of ardor. And although these two excellent attributes include the third, yet the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> belonging to the "Thrones" does not include the other two; and so the order of the "Thrones" is distinguished from the orders of the "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" and the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>." For it is a common rule in all things that the excellence of the inferior is contained in the superior, but not conversely. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii) explains the name "Thrones" by its relation to material seats, in which we may consider four things.

<p>First, the site; because seats are raised above the earth, and to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are called "Thrones" are raised up to the immediate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the types of things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Secondly, because in material seats is displayed strength, forasmuch as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sits firmly on them. But here the reverse is the case; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves are made firm by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the seat receives him who sits thereon, and he can be carried thereupon; and so the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> receive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in themselves, and in a certain way bear Him to the inferior creatures.

<p>Fourthly, because in its shape, a seat is open on one side to receive the sitter; and thus are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> promptly open to receive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to serve Him.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the grades of the orders are properly assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the grades of the orders are not properly assigned. For the order of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> is the highest. But the names of "Dominations," "Principalities," and "Powers" of themselves imply prelacy. Therefore these orders ought to be supreme.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the nearer an order is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the higher it is. But the order of "Thrones" is the nearest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for nothing is nearer to the sitter than the seat. Therefore the order of the "Thrones" is the highest.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes before love, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is higher than will. Therefore the order of "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" seems to be higher than the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxiv in Evang.) places the "Principalities" above the "Powers." These therefore are not placed immediately above the Archangels, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ix).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), places in the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" as the first, the "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" as the middle, the "Thrones" as the last; in the middle <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> he places the "Dominations," as the first, the "Virtues" in the middle, the "Powers" last; in the lowest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the "Principalities" first, then the "Archangels," and lastly the "Angels."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The grades of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders are assigned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. vii), who agree as regards all except the "Principalities" and "Virtues." For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> places the "Virtues" beneath the "Dominations," and above the "Powers"; the "Principalities" beneath the "Powers" and above the "Archangels." <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, however, places the "Principalities" between the "Dominations" and the "Powers"; and the "Virtues" between the "Powers" and the "Archangels." Each of these placings may claim authority from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse20">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>) enumerates the middle orders, beginning from the lowest saying that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set Him," i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "on His right hand in the heavenly places above all Principality and Power, and Virtue, and Dominion." Here he places "Virtues" between "Powers" and "Dominations," according to the placing of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>. Writing however to the Colossians (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">1:16</a>), numbering the same orders from the highest, he says: "Whether Thrones, or Dominations, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him and in Him." Here he places the "Principalities" between "Dominations" and "Powers," as does also <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>.

<p>Let us then first examine the reason for the ordering of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, in which we see, that, as said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> contemplates the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; the second in the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and third in their application to particular effects. And because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the end not only of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministrations, but also of the whole creation, it belongs to the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to consider the end; to the middle one belongs the universal disposition of what is to be done; and to the last belongs the application of this disposition to the effect, which is the carrying out of the work; for it is clear that these three things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in every kind of operation. So <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, considering the properties of the orders as derived from their names, places in the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> those orders the names of which are taken from their relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>," "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>," and "Thrones"; and he places in the middle <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> those orders whose names denote a certain kind of common government or disposition--the "Dominations," "Virtues," and "Powers"; and he places in the third <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the orders whose names denote the execution of the work, the "Principalities," "Angels," and "Archangels."

<p>As regards the end, three things may be considered. For firstly we consider the end; then we acquire perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end; thirdly, we fix our <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> on the end; of which the second is an addition to the first, and the third an addition to both. And because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the end of creatures, as the leader is the end of an army, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10); so a somewhat similar order may be seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. For there are some who enjoy the dignity of being able with familiarity to approach the king or leader; others in addition are privileged to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his secrets; and others above these ever abide with him, in a close union. According to this similitude, we can understand the disposition in the orders of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; for the "Thrones" are raised up so as to be the familiar recipients of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in themselves, in the sense of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> immediately the types of things in Himself; and this is proper to the whole of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Divine secrets supereminently; and the "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" excel in what is the supreme excellence of all, in being united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; and all this in such a manner that the whole of this <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> can be called the "Thrones"; as, from what is common to all the heavenly spirits together, they are all called "Angels."

<p>As regards government, three things are comprised therein, the first of which is to appoint those things which are to be done, and this belongs to the "Dominations"; the second is to give the power of carrying out what is to be done, which belongs to the "Virtues"; the third is to order how what has been commanded or decided to be done can be carried out by others, which belongs to the "Powers."

<p>The execution of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministrations consists in announcing Divine things. Now in the execution of any action there are beginners and leaders; as in singing, the precentors; and in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, generals and officers; this belongs to the "Principalities." There are others who simply execute what is to be done; and these are the "Angels." Others hold a middle place; and these are the "Archangels," as above explained.

<p>This explanation of the orders is quite a reasonable one. For the highest in an inferior order always has affinity to the lowest in the higher order; as the lowest animals are near to the plants. Now the first order is that of the Divine Persons, which terminates in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is Love proceeding, with Whom the highest order of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> has affinity, denominated as it is from the fire of love. The lowest order of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is that of the "Thrones," who in their own order are akin to the "Dominations"; for the "Thrones," according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxiv in Ev.), are so called "because through them <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accomplishes His judgments," since they are enlightened by Him in a manner adapted to the immediate enlightening of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, to which belongs the disposition of the Divine ministrations. The order of the "Powers" is akin to the order of the "Principalities"; for as it belongs to the "Powers" to impose order on those subject to them, this ordering is plainly shown at once in the name of "Principalities," who, as presiding over the government of peoples and kingdoms (which occupies the first and principal place in the Divine ministrations), are the first in the execution thereof; "for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a nation is more divine than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" (Ethic. i, 2); and hence it is written, "The prince of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> resisted me" (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse13">Daniel 10:13</a>).

<p>The disposition of the orders which is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is also reasonable. For since the "Dominations" appoint and order what belongs to the Divine ministrations, the orders subject to them are arranged according to the disposition of those things in which the Divine ministrations are effected. Still, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.), "bodies are ruled in a certain order; the inferior by the superior; and all of them by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature, and the bad spirit by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirit." So the first order after the "Dominations" is called that of "Principalities," who rule even over <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirits; then the "Powers," who coerce the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirits; even as evil-doers are coerced by earthly powers, as it is written (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse3">Romans 13:3-4</a>). After these come the "Virtues," which have power over corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; after these are the "Angels" and the "Archangels," who announce to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> either great things above reason, or small things within the purview of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is greater than their presiding over inferior things; and the latter is derived from the former. Thus the orders which derive their name from presiding are not the first and highest; but rather the orders deriving their name from their nearness and relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> designated by the name of the "Thrones," belongs also to the "<a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>," and in a more excellent way, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As above explained (27, 3), <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> takes place accordingly as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower; but love as the lover is united to the object loved. Now higher things are in a nobler way in themselves than in lower things; whereas lower things are in higher things in a nobler way than they are in themselves. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> lower things is better than to love them; and to love the higher things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all, is better than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A careful comparison will show that little or no difference <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in reality between the dispositions of the orders according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expounds the name "Principalities" from their "presiding over <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirits," which also agrees with the "Virtues" accordingly as this name expressed a certain strength, giving efficacy to the inferior spirits in the execution of the Divine ministrations. Again, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, the "Virtues" seem to be the same as "Principalities" of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>. For to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> holds the first place in the Divine ministrations; since thereby the way is prepared for the announcements of the "Archangels" and the "Angels."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the orders will outlast the Day of Judgment?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will not outlast the Day of Judgment. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>), that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will "bring to naught all principality and power, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father," and this will be in the final consummaion. Therefore for the same reason all others will be abolished in that state.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to the office of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders it belongs to cleanse, enlighten, and perfect. But after the Day of Judgment one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> will not cleanse, enlighten, or perfect another, because they will not advance any more in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders would remain for no purpose.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>), that "they are all ministering spirits, sent to minister to them who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>"; whence it appears that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices are ordered for the purpose of leading men to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> are in pursuit of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> until the Day of Judgment. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices and orders will not outlast the Day of Judgment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jdg005.htm#verse20">Judges 5:20</a>): "Stars remaining in their order and courses," which is applied to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will ever remain in their orders.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders we may consider two things; the distinction of grades, and the execution of their offices. The distinction of grades among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> takes place according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as above explained (4); and these differences will ever remain in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for these differences of natures cannot be taken from them unless they themselves be corrupted. The difference of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will also ever remain in them according to the difference of preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. As to the execution of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices, it will to a certain degree remain after the Day of Judgment, and to a certain degree will cease. It will cease accordingly as their offices are directed towards leading others to their end; but it will remain, accordingly as it agrees with the attainment of the end. Thus also the various ranks of soldiers have different duties to perform in battle and in triumph.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The principalities and powers will come to an end in that final consummaion as regards their office of leading others to their end; because when the end is attained, it is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to tend towards the end. This is clear from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, "When He shall have delivered up the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and the Father," i.e. when He shall have led the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The actions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are to be considered according to a likeness to our own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> actions. In ourselves we find many <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> actions which are ordered according to the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect; as when we gradually arrive at one conclusion by many middle terms. Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a conclusion depends on all the preceding middle terms not only in the new acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also as regards the keeping of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired. A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is that when anyone forgets any of the preceding middle terms he can have opinion or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> about the conclusion, but not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; as he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. So, since the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the types of the Divine works by the light of the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> depends on the light of the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not only as regards the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also as regards the preserving of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed. So, although after the Judgment the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will not progress in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some things, still this will not prevent their being enlightened by the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although after the Day of Judgment men will not be led any more to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, still those who are already saved will be enlightened through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministry.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether men are taken up into the angelic orders?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men are not taken up into the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is stationed beneath the lowest heavenly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, as the lowest under the middle <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and the middle beneath the first. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the lowest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are never transferred into the middle, or the first. Therefore neither are men transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, certain offices belong to the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as to guard, to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, to coerce the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and the like; which do not appear to belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Therefore they are not transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lead on to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so do the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of bad men are changed into <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> rejects this (Hom. xxviii in Matt.). Therefore it does not seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will be transferred to the orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Lord says of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that, "they will be as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above explained (4,7), the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and according to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Considered only as regards the grade of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, men can in no way be assumed into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders; for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> distinction will always remain. In view of this distinction, some asserted that men can in no way be transferred to an equality with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, contradicting as it does the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> saying that the children of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke 20:36</a>). For whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the material part of an order; whilst that which perfects is from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which depends on the liberality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not on the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in such a degree as to be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in each of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> grades; and this implies that men are taken up into the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Some, however, say that not all who are saved are assumed into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders, but only <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> or the perfect; and that the other will constitute their own order, as it were, corresponding to the whole society of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But this is against what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9), that "there will not be two societies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but only one; because the beatitude of all is to cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is given to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in proportion to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. This, however, does not apply to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as above explained (4; 62, 6). So, as the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot be transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> grade of the superior, neither can they be transferred to the superior grade of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; whereas men can ascend to the grade of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are between us and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are administered by them, but also all corporeal matters. But <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men even after this life are of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with ourselves; and hence according to the common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> they do not administer <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, "nor do they interfere in the things of the living," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De cura pro mortuis xiii, xvi). Still, by a certain special dispensation it is sometimes granted to some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to exercise these offices; by working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, by coercing the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or by doing something of that kind, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De cura pro mortuis xvi).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to say that men are transferred to the penalty of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; but some erroneously stated that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are nothing but <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead; and it is this that <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> rejects.
