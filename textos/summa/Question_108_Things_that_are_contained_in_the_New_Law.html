<h1>Question 108. Things that are contained in the New Law</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2108.htm#article1"> Should the New Law prescribe or forbid any outward works?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2108.htm#article2"> Does the New Law make sufficient provision in prescribing and forbidding external acts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2108.htm#article3"> Does it direct man sufficiently in the matter of internal acts?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2108.htm#article4"> Does it fittingly add counsels to precepts?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the New Law ought to prescribe or prohibit any external acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> should not prescribe or prohibit any external acts. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is the Gospel of the kingdom, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse14">Matthew 24:14</a>: "This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world." But the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> consists not in exterior, but only in interior acts, according to <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke 17:21</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is within you"; and <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink; but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> should not prescribe or forbid any external acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a>). But "where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty" (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>). Now there is no liberty when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to do or avoid certain external acts. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> does not prescribe or forbid any external acts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all external acts are understood as referable to the hand, just as interior acts belong to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. But this is assigned as the difference between the New and Old Laws that the "<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> restrains the hand, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> curbs the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>" [<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Sent. iii, D, 40. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> should not contain prohibitions and commands about exterior <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but only about interior acts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, men are made "children of light": wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse36">John 12:36</a>): "Believe in the light that you may be the children of light." Now it is becoming that children of the light should do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of light and cast aside <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of darkness, according to <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians 5:8</a>: "You were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk . . . as children of the light." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> had to forbid certain external acts and prescribe others.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (106, 1,2), the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> consists chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is shown forth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh through love. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> become receivers of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Son made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Whose humanity <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> filled first, and thence flowed forth to us. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "The Word was made flesh," and afterwards: "full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and further on: "Of His fulness we all have received, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Hence it is added that "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Consequently it was becoming that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> flows from the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> Word should be given to us by means of certain external sensible objects; and that from this inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby the flesh is subjected to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, certain external works should ensue.

<p>Accordingly external acts may have a twofold connection with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In the first place, as leading in some way to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Such are the sacramental acts which are instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and the like.

<p>In the second place there are those external acts which ensue from the promptings of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: and herein we must observe a difference. For there are some which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> in keeping with, or in opposition to inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> consisting in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh through love. Such external works are prescribed or forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>; thus confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is prescribed, and denial of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is forbidden; for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew 10:32-33</a>) "(Every one) that shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father . . . But he that shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father." On the other hand, there are works which are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> opposed to, or in keeping with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh through love. Such works are not prescribed or forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, by virtue of its primitive institution; but have been left by the Lawgiver, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to the discretion of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And so to each one it is free to decide what he should do or avoid; and to each superior, to direct his subjects in such matters as regards what they must do or avoid. Wherefore also in this respect the Gospel is called the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of liberty" [Cf. Reply to Objection 2]: since the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> decided many points and left few to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to decide as he chose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> consists chiefly in internal acts: but as a consequence all things that are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to internal acts belong also to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Thus if the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is internal righteousness, peace, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, all external acts that are incompatible with righteousness, peace, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, are in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; and consequently should be forbidden in the Gospel of the kingdom. On the other hand, those things that are indifferent as regards the aforesaid, for instance, to eat of this or that food, are not part of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says before the words quoted: "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. i, 2), what is "free is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself." Therefore he acts freely, who acts of his own accord. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does of his own accord that which he does from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that is suitable to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: since a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> inclines one as a second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If, however, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> be in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not act according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but according to some corruption affecting that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Since then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is like an interior <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> bestowed on us and inclining us to act aright, it makes us do freely those things that are becoming to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and shun what is opposed to it.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of liberty in two respects. First, because it does not bind us to do or avoid certain things, except such as are of themselves <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or opposed to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and come under the prescription or prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Secondly, because it also makes us comply freely with these precepts and prohibitions, inasmuch as we do so through the promptings of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. It is for these two reasons that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is called "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of perfect liberty" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse25">James 1:25</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, by restraining the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from inordinate movements, must needs also restrain the hand from inordinate acts, which ensue from inward movements.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the New Law made sufficient ordinations about external acts?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> made insufficient ordinations about external acts. Because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> seems chiefly to belong to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>: "In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> availeth anything, nor uncircumcision: but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> declared explicitly certain points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which were not set forth explicitly in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; for instance, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Therefore it should also have added certain outward moral <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which were not fixed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> not only were <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> instituted, but also certain sacred things, as stated above (101, 4; 102, 4). But in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, although certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; for instance, pertaining either to the sanctification of a temple or of the vessels, or to the celebration of some particular feast. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> made insufficient ordinations about external matters.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, just as there were certain observances pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers, so also were there certain observances pertaining to the people: as was stated above when we were treating of the ceremonial of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (101, 4; 102, 6). Now in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> certain observances seem to have been prescribed to the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as may be gathered from <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9</a>: "Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses," nor other things which are mentioned here and <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9</a> and <a href="../bible/luk010.htm">10</a>. Therefore certain observances pertaining to the faithful should also have been instituted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, besides moral and ceremonial precepts, there were certain judicial precepts. But in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> there are no judicial precepts. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> made insufficient ordinations about external works.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew 7:24</a>): "Every one . . . that heareth these My words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that built his house upon a rock." But a wise builder leaves out nothing that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the building. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words contain all things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> had to make such prescriptions or prohibitions alone as are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> for the reception or right use of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And since we cannot of ourselves obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of Himself instituted the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whereby we obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: viz. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, Orders of the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, by the institution of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and seventy-two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Penance, and indissoluble Matrimony. He promised Confirmation through the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and we read that by His institution the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> healed the sick by anointing them with oil (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse13">Mark 6:13</a>). These are the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>.

<p>The right use of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is by means of works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. These, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, pertain to the moral precepts, which also formed part of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Hence, in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> had nothing to add as regards external action. The determination of these works in their relation to the divine worship, belongs to the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; and, in relation to our neighbor, to the judicial precepts, as stated above (Question 99, Article 4). And therefore, since these determinations are not in themselves <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> connected with inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> wherein the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> consists, they do not come under a precept of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, but are left to the decision of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; some relating to inferiors--as when a precept is given to an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; others, relating to superiors, temporal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, referring, namely, to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> had no other external works to determine, by prescribing or forbidding, except the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and those moral precepts which have a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for instance, that one must not kill, or steal, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and so we cannot attain to them except through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently, when <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> came to be bestowed more abundantly, the result was an increase in the number of explicit points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On the other hand, it is through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> that we are directed to works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for it is the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action, as stated above (19, 3; 63, 2). Wherefore in such matters as these there was no need for any precepts to be given besides the moral precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which proceed from the dictate of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed, which cannot be received except through Christ: consequently they had to be instituted by Him. But in the sacred things no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given: for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a temple, an altar or the like, or, again, in the celebration of feasts. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> left the institution of such things to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, since they have not of themselves any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection with inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> those precepts not as ceremonial observances, but as moral statutes: and they can be understood in two ways. First, following <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Consensu Evang. 30), as being not commands but permissions. For He permitted them to set forth to preach without scrip or stick, and so on, since they were empowered to accept their livelihood from those to whom they preached: wherefore He goes on to say: "For the laborer is worthy of his hire." Nor is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a work of supererogation for a preacher to take means of livelihood with him, without accepting supplies from those to whom he preaches; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 9:4, seqq.</a>).

<p>Secondly, according to the explanation of other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, they may be considered as temporal commands laid upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for the time during which they were sent to preach in Judea before <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, being yet as little children under <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> care, needed to receive some special commands from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, such as all subjects receive from their superiors: and especially so, since they were to be accustomed little by little to renounce the care of temporalities, so as to become fitted for the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world. Nor must we wonder if He established certain fixed modes of life, as long as the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> endured and the people had not as yet achieved the perfect liberty of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. These statutes He abolished shortly before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, as though the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had by their means become sufficiently practiced. Hence He said (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse35">Luke 22:35-36</a>) "When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything? But they said: Nothing. Then said He unto them: But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip." Because the time of perfect liberty was already at hand, when they would be left entirely to their own judgment in matters not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> connected with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Judicial precepts also, are not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of any particular determination, but only in regard to the common notion of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> left the judicial precepts to the discretion of those who were to have <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> or temporal charge of others. But as regards the judicial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, some of them He explained, because they were misunderstood by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, as we shall state later on (3, ad 2).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the New Law directed man sufficiently as regards interior actions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> directed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> insufficiently as regards interior actions. For there are ten commandments of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> directing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> partly fulfilled only three of them: as regards, namely, the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and of perjury. Therefore it seems that, by omitting to fulfil the other precepts, He directed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> insufficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as regards the judicial precepts, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> ordained nothing in the Gospel, except in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> of wife, of punishment by retaliation, and of persecuting one's enemies. But there are many other judicial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, as stated above (104, 4; 105). Therefore, in this respect, He directed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life insufficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, besides moral and judicial, there were ceremonial precepts about which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> made no ordination. Therefore it seems that He ordained insufficiently.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be inwardly well disposed, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should do no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> for any temporal whatever. But there are many other temporal goods besides the favor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and there are many other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works besides <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms-deeds</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> unbecomingly taught that only in respect of these three works, and of no other earthly goods ought we to shun the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favor.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of livelihood is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> instilled into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and this solicitude even other animals share with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse6">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>): "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways . . . she provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest." But every command issued against the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> command, forasmuch as it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> unbecomingly forbade solicitude about food and raiment.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, no act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be the subject of a prohibition. Now judgment is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse15">Psalm 18:15</a>: "Until <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be turned into judgment." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> unbecomingly forbade judgment: and consequently that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> directed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> insufficiently in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of interior acts.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 1): We should take note that, when He said: "'He that heareth these My words,' He indicates clearly that this sermon of the Lord is replete with all the precepts whereby a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> life is formed."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is evident from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> words just quoted, the sermon, contains the whole process of forming the life of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Therein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> interior movements are ordered. Because after declaring that his end is Beatitude; and after commending the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, through whom the teaching of the Gospel was to be promulgated, He orders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> interior movements, first in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, secondly in regard to his neighbor.

<p>This he does in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, in two ways, corresponding to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> two interior movements in respect of any prospective action, viz. volition of what has to be done, and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end. Wherefore, in the first place, He directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will in respect of the various precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: by prescribing that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should refrain not merely from those external works that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in themselves, but also from internal acts, and from the occasions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. In the second place He directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, by teaching that in our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, we should seek neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, nor worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, which is to lay up treasures on earth.

<p>Afterwards He directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> interior movement in respect of his neighbor, by forbidding us, on the one hand, to judge him rashly, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, or presumptuously; and, on the other, to entrust him too readily with sacred things if he be unworthy.

<p>Lastly, He teaches us how to fulfil the teaching of the Gospel; viz. by imploring the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by striving to enter by the narrow door of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and by being wary lest we be led astray by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences. Moreover, He declares that we must observe His commandments, and that it is not enough to make profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or merely to hear His words.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> explained the manner of fulfilling those precepts which the Scribes and Pharisees did not rightly understand: and this affected chiefly those precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. For they thought that the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> covered the external act only, and not the internal desire. And they held this opinion about <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> rather than about <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> tending to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and the movement of desire tending to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, seem to be in us from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> somewhat, but not the desire of stealing or bearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness. They held a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about perjury, for they thought that perjury indeed was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that oaths were of themselves to be desired and to be taken frequently, since they seem to proceed from reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> shows that an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is not desirable as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing; and that it is better to speak without oaths, unless <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> forces us to have recourse to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Scribes and Pharisees <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> about the judicial precepts in two ways. First, because they considered certain matters contained in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a> by way of permission, to be right in themselves: namely, <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> of a wife, and the taking of usury from strangers. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbade a man to <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">divorce</a> his wife (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew 5:32</a>); and to receive usury (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse35">Luke 6:35</a>), when He said: "Lend, hoping for nothing thereby."

<p>In another way they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> by thinking that certain things which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> commanded to be done for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice's</a> sake, should be done out of desire for revenge, or out of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for temporal goods, or out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's enemies; and this in respect of three precepts. For they thought that desire for revenge was lawful, on account of the precept concerning punishment by retaliation: whereas this precept was given that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> might be safeguarded, not that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might seek revenge. Wherefore, in order to do away with this, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> teaches that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be prepared in his mind to suffer yet more if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. They thought that movements of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> were lawful on account of those judicial precepts which prescribed restitution of what had been purloined, together with something added thereto, as stated above (105, 2, ad 9); whereas the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> commanded this to be done in order to safeguard <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, not to encourage <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> teaches that we should not demand our goods from motives of cupidity, and that we should be ready to give yet more if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. They thought that the movement of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was lawful, on account of the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> about the slaying of one's enemies: whereas the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> ordered this for the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (105, 3, ad 4), not to satisfy <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> teaches us that we ought to love our enemies, and to be ready to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. For these precepts are to be taken as binding "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be prepared to fulfil them," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 19).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The moral precepts <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> retained their force under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, because they are of themselves <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: whereas the judicial precepts did not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> continue to bind in exactly the same way as had been fixed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: this was left to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to decide in one way or another. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> directed us becomingly with regard to these two kinds of precepts. On the other hand, the observance of the ceremonial precepts was totally abolished by the advent of the reality; wherefore in regard to these precepts He commanded nothing on this occasion when He was giving the general points of His doctrine. Elsewhere, however, He makes it clear that the entire bodily worship which was fixed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, was to be changed into <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worship: as is evident from <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse21">John 4:21-23</a>, where He says: "The hour cometh when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the Father . . . but . . . the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adorers shall <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the Father in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All worldly goods may be reduced to three--honors, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and pleasures; according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>: "All that is in the world is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh," which refers to pleasures of the flesh, "and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes," which refers to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, "and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life," which refers to ambition for renown and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> did not promise an abundance of carnal pleasures; on the contrary, it forbade them. But it did promise exalted honors and abundant <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; for it is written in reference to the former (<a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>): "If thou wilt hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> . . . He will make thee higher than all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>"; and in reference to the latter, we read a little further on (<a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>): "He will make thee abound with all goods." But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> so distorted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of these promises, as to think that we ought to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with these things as the end in view. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> set this aside by teaching, first of all, that works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should not be done for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And He mentions three works, to which all others may be reduced: since whatever a man does in order to curb his desires, comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; and whatever a man does for the love of his neighbor, comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms-deeds</a>; and whatever a man does for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And He mentions these three specifically, as they hold the principal place, and are most often used by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in order to gain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. In the second place He taught us that we must not place our end in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, when He said: "Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth" (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew 6:19</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbade, not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but inordinate solicitude. Now there is a fourfold solicitude to be avoided in temporal matters. First, we must not place our end in them, nor serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of the necessities of food and raiment. Wherefore He says: "Lay not up for yourselves," etc. Secondly, we must not be so anxious about temporal things, as to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse32">Matthew 6:32</a>): "Your Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that you have need of all these things." Thirdly, we must not add presumption to our solicitude; in other words, we must not be confident of getting the necessaries of life by our own efforts without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help: such solicitude <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> sets aside by saying that a man cannot add anything to his stature (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse27">Matthew 6:27</a>). We must not anticipate the time for anxiety; namely, by being solicitous now, for the needs, not of the present, but of a future time: wherefore He says (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a>): "Be not . . . solicitous for tomorrow."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> did not forbid the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, without which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things could not be withdrawn from the unworthy. But he forbade inordinate judgment, as stated above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether certain definite counsels are fittingly proposed in the New Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that certain definite counsels are not fittingly proposed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. For counsels are given about that which is expedient for an end, as we stated above, when treating of counsel (14, 2). But the same things are not expedient for all. Therefore certain definite counsels should not be proposed to all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, counsels regard a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But there are no definite degrees to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore definite counsels should not be given.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, counsels pertain to the life of perfection. But obedience pertains to the life of perfection. Therefore it was unfitting that no counsel of obedience should be contained in the Gospel.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, many matters pertaining to the life of perfection are found among the commandments, as, for instance, "Love your enemies" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>), and those precepts which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> gave His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm">Matthew 10</a>). Therefore the counsels are unfittingly given in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>: both because they are not all mentioned; and because they are not distinguished from the commandments.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The counsels of a wise friend are of great use, according to <a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse9">Proverbs 27:9</a>: "Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsels of a friend rejoice the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is our wisest and greatest friend. Therefore His counsels are supremely useful and becoming.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The difference between a counsel and a commandment is that a commandment implies <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, whereas a counsel is left to the option of the one to whom it is given. Consequently in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of liberty, counsels are added to the commandments, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of bondage. We must therefore understand the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> to have been given about matters that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to gain the end of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">eternal bliss</a>, to which end the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> brings us forthwith: but that the counsels are about matters that render the gaining of this end more assured and expeditious.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is placed between the things of this world, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods wherein <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists: so that the more he cleaves to the one, the more he withdraws from the other, and conversely. Wherefore he that cleaves wholly to the things of this world, so as to make them his end, and to look upon them as the reason and rule of all he does, falls away altogether from <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. Hence this disorder is removed by the commandments. Nevertheless, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to gain the end aforesaid, he does not need to renounce the things of the world altogether: since he can, while using the things of this world, attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, provided he does not place his end in them: but he will attain more speedily thereto by giving up the goods of this world entirely: wherefore the evangelical counsels are given for this purpose.

<p>Now the goods of this world which come into use in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, consist in three things: viz. in external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> pertaining to the "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes"; carnal pleasures pertaining to the "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh"; and honors, which pertain to the "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life," according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>: and it is in renouncing these altogether, as far as possible, that the evangelical counsels consist. Moreover, every form of the religious life that professes the state of perfection is based on these three: since <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are renounced by <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>; carnal pleasures by perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life by the bondage of obedience.

<p>Now if a man observe these absolutely, this is in accordance with the counsels as they stand. But if a man observe any one of them in a particular case, this is taking that counsel in a restricted sense, namely, as applying to that particular case. For instance, when anyone gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not being bound so to do, he follows the counsels in that particular case. In like manner, when a man for some fixed time refrains from carnal pleasures that he may give himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he follows the counsel for that particular time. And again, when a man follows not his will as to some <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which he might do lawfully, he follows the counsel in that particular case: for instance, if he do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to his enemies when he is not bound to, or if he forgive an injury of which he might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> seek to be avenged. In this way, too, all particular counsels may be reduced to these three general and perfect counsels.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The aforesaid counsels, considered in themselves, are expedient to all; but owing to some people being ill-disposed, it happens that some of them are inexpedient, because their disposition is not inclined to such things. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, in proposing the evangelical counsels, always makes mention of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fitness for observing the counsels. For in giving the counsel of perpetual <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>), He begins with the words: "If thou wilt be perfect," and then He adds: "Go, sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast." In like manner when He gave the counsel of perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a>): "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>," He adds straightway: "He that can take, let him take it." And again, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse35">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>), after giving the counsel of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, says: "And this I speak for your profit; not to cast a snare upon you."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The greater goods are not definitely fixed in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; but those which are simply and absolutely the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general are fixed: and to these all the above particular goods may be reduced, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even the counsel of obedience is understood to have been given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in the words: "And [let him] follow Me." For we follow Him not only by imitating His works, but also by obeying His commandments, according to <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse27">John 10:27</a>: "My sheep hear My voice . . . and they follow Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> prescribed about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> love of our enemies, and other similar sayings (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm">Luke 6</a>), may be referred to the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and then they are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for instance, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be prepared to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to his enemies, and other similar actions, when there is need. Hence these things are placed among the precepts. But that anyone should actually and promptly behave thus towards an enemy when there is no special need, is to be referred to the particular counsels, as stated above. As to those matters which are set down in <a href="../bible/mat010.htm">Matthew 10</a> and <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9</a> and <a href="../bible/luk010.htm">10</a>, they were either disciplinary commands for that particular time, or concessions, as stated above (2, ad 3). Hence they are not set down among the counsels.
