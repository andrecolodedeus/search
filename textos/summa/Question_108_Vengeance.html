<h1>Question 108. Vengeance</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3108.htm#article1"> Is vengeance lawful?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3108.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3108.htm#article3"> The manner of taking vengeance</a> <li><a href="../summa/3108.htm#article4"> On whom should vengeance be taken?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether vengeance is lawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vengeance is not lawful. For whoever usurps what is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But vengeance belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans 12:19</a>): "Revenge to Me, and I will repay." Therefore all vengeance is unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he that takes vengeance on a man does not bear with him. But we ought to bear with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Canticles 2:2</a>, "As the lily among the thorns," says: "He is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cannot bear with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one." Therefore we should not take vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, vengeance is taken by inflicting punishment, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of servile fear. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of fear, but of love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Contra Adamant. xvii). Therefore at least in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> all vengeance is unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a man is said to avenge himself when he takes revenge for wrongs inflicted on himself. But, seemingly, it is unlawful even for a judge to punish those who have wronged him: for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Cf. Opus Imperfectum, Hom. v in Matth., <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>] says: "Let us learn after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> example to bear our own wrongs with magnanimity, yet not to suffer <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wrongs, not even by listening to them." Therefore vengeance seems to be unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a multitude is more harmful than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of only one: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse5">Sirach 26:5-7</a>): "Of three things my heart hath been afraid . . . the accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people, and a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>." But vengeance should not be taken on the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a multitude, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew 13:29-30</a>, "Lest perhaps . . . you root up the wheat . . . suffer both to grow," says that "a multitude should not be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, nor should the sovereign." Neither therefore is any other vengeance lawful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> We should look to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for nothing save what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and lawful. But we are to look to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for vengeance on His enemies: for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse7">Luke 18:7</a>): "Will not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revenge His <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> who cry to Him day and night?" as if to say: "He will indeed." Therefore vengeance is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and unlawful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Vengeance consists in the infliction of a penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on one who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Accordingly, in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of vengeance, we must consider the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the avenger. For if his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is directed chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom he takes vengeance and rests there, then his vengeance is altogether unlawful: because to take pleasure in another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we are bound to love all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Nor is it an excuse that he intends the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of one who has <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> inflicted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on him, as neither is a man excused for hating one that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> him: for a man may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against another just because the latter has already <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against him, since this is to be overcome by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which was forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who says (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse21">Romans 12:21</a>): "Be not overcome by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p>If, however, the avenger's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> be directed chiefly to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to be obtained by means of the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> (for instance that the sinner may amend, or at least that he may be restrained and others be not disturbed, that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be upheld, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>), then vengeance may be lawful, provided other due circumstances be observed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He who takes vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in keeping with his rank and position does not usurp what belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but makes use of the power granted him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse4">Romans 13:4</a>) of the earthly prince that "he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." If, however, a man takes vengeance outside the order of divine appointment, he usurps what is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> and therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> bear with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by enduring patiently, and in due manner, the wrongs they themselves receive from them: but they do not bear with them as to endure the wrongs they inflict on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their neighbor. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Cf. Opus Imperfectum, Hom. v in Matth., <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>] says: "It is praiseworthy to be patient under our own wrongs, but to overlook <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wrongs is most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of love, and therefore those who do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> out of love, and who alone properly belong to the Gospel, ought not to be terrorized by means of punishment, but only those who are not moved by love to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and who, though they belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> outwardly, do not belong to it in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sometimes a wrong done to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> reflects on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and then it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to avenge the wrong. For example, Elias made fire descend on those who were come to seize him (<a href="../bible/2ki001.htm">2 Kings 1</a>); likewise Eliseus <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> the boys that mocked him (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm">2 Kings 2</a>); and Pope Sylverius <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> those who sent him into exile (XXIII, Q. iv, Cap. Guilisarius). But in so far as the wrong inflicted on a man affects his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, he should bear it patiently if this be expedient. For these precepts of patience are to be understood as referring to preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> When the whole multitude <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, vengeance must be taken on them, either in respect of the whole multitude--thus the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea while they were pursuing the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/exo014.htm">Exodus 14</a>), and the people of Sodom were entirely destroyed (<a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis 19</a>)--or as regards part of the multitude, as may be seen in the punishment of those who worshipped the calf.

<p>Sometimes, however, if there is hope of many making amends, the severity of vengeance should be brought to bear on a few of the principals, whose punishment fills the rest with fear; thus the Lord (<a href="../bible/num025.htm">Numbers 25</a>) commanded the princes of the people to be hanged for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the multitude.

<p>On the other hand, if it is not the whole but only a part of the multitude that has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, then if the guilty can be separated from the innocent, vengeance should be wrought on them: provided, however, that this can be done without <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to others; else the multitude should be spared and severity foregone. The same applies to the sovereign, whom the multitude follow. For his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be borne with, if it cannot be punished without <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the multitude: unless indeed his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were such, that it would do more harm to the multitude, either spiritually or temporally, than would the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> that was feared to arise from his punishment.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether vengeance is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vengeance is not a special and distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For just as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are rewarded for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> punished for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now the rewarding of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> does not belong to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is an act of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore in the same way vengeance should not be accounted a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no need to appoint a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for an act to which a man is sufficiently disposed by the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sufficiently disposed by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> or zeal to avenge <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore vengeance should not be reckoned a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to every special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But seemingly no special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to vengeance. Therefore it is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons it a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 1), aptitude to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but the complement of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us through habituation or some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfect us so that we follow in due manner our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclinations, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> right. Wherefore to every definite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination there corresponds a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now there is a special inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to remove harm, for which reason animals have the irascible power distinct from the concupiscible. Man resists harm by defending himself against wrongs, lest they be inflicted on him, or he avenges those which have already been inflicted on him, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not of harming, but of removing the harm done. And this belongs to vengeance, for Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that by "vengeance we resist force, or wrong, and in general whatever is obscure" ['Obscurum' Cicero wrote 'obfuturum' but the sense is the same as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives in the parenthesis] "(i.e. derogatory), either by self-defense or by avenging it." Therefore vengeance is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as repayment of a legal debt belongs to commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and as repayment of a moral debt, arising from the bestowal of a particular favor, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of gratitude, so too the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so far as it is the concern of public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is an act of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; while so far as it is concerned in defending the rights of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by whom a wrong is resisted, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of revenge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fortitude disposes to vengeance by removing an obstacle thereto, namely, fear of an imminent danger. Zeal, as denoting the fervor of love, signifies the primary root of vengeance, in so far as a man avenges the wrong done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> makes him regard them as his own. Now every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as its root, since, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxvii in Ev.), "there are no green leaves on the bough of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, unless <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> be the root."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to vengeance: one by way of excess, namely, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of cruelty or brutality, which exceeds the measure in punishing: while the other is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by way of deficiency and consists in being remiss in punishing, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse24">Proverbs 13:24</a>): "He that spareth the rod hateth his son." But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of vengeance consists in observing the due measure of vengeance with regard to all the circumstances.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether vengeance should be wrought by means of punishments customary among men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vengeance should not be wrought by means of punishments customary among men. For to put a man to death is to uproot him. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> forbade (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew 13:29</a>) the uprooting of the cockle, whereby the children of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one are signified. Therefore sinners should not be put to death.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally seem to be deserving of the same punishment. Therefore if some who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally are punished with death, it seems that all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be punished with death: and this is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to punish a man publicly for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> seems to publish his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and this would seem to have a harmful effect on the multitude, since the example of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken by them as an occasion for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that the punishment of death should not be inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> These punishments are fixed by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> as appears from what we have said above (I-II, 105, 2).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Vengeance is lawful and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> so far as it tends to the prevention of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now some who are not influenced by motive of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are prevented from committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through fear of losing those things which they love more than those they obtain by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, else fear would be no restraint to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently vengeance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be taken by depriving a man of what he loves most. Now the things which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves most are life, bodily safety, his own freedom, and external goods such as <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, his country and his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>. Wherefore, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> reckoning (De Civ. Dei xxi), "Tully writes that the laws recognize eight kinds of punishment": namely, "death," whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is deprived of life; "stripes," "retaliation," or the loss of eye for eye, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forfeits his bodily safety; "slavery," and "imprisonment," whereby he is deprived of freedom; "exile" whereby he is banished from his country; "fines," whereby he is mulcted in his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; "ignominy," whereby he loses his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> forbids the uprooting of the cockle, when there is fear lest the wheat be uprooted together with it. But sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> can be uprooted by death, not only without danger, but even with great profit, to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore in such a case the punishment of death may be inflicted on sinners.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally are deserving of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, as regards future retribution, which is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine judgment. But the punishments of this life are more of a medicinal character; wherefore the punishment of death is inflicted on those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> alone which conduce to the grave undoing of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very fact that the punishment, whether of death or of any kind that is fearsome to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will avers to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because the fear of punishment is greater than the enticement of the example of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether vengeance should be taken on those who have sinned involuntarily?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vengeance should be taken on those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> involuntarily. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not follow from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another. Yet one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is punished for another, according to <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus 20:5</a>, "I am . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . jealous, visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation." Thus for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Cham, his son Chanaan was curse (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse25">Genesis 9:25</a>) and for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Giezi, his descendants were struck with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm">2 Kings 5</a>). Again the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> lays the descendants of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> under the ban of punishment, for they said (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew 27:25</a>): "His blood be upon us and upon our children." Moreover we read (<a href="../bible/jos007.htm">Joshua 7</a>) that the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were delivered into the hands of their enemies for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Achan, and that the same people were overthrown by the Philistines on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the sons of Heli (<a href="../bible/1sa004.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is to be punished without having deserved it <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> except what is in a man's power. But sometimes a man is punished for what is not in his power; thus a man is removed from the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on account of being infected with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>; and a Church ceases to be an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> see on account of the depravity or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the people. Therefore vengeance is taken not only for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> makes an act involuntary. Now vengeance is sometimes taken on the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Thus the children of the people of Sodom, though they were in invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, perished with their parents (<a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis 19</a>). Again, for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Dathan and Abiron their children were swallowed up together with them (<a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers 16</a>). Moreover, dumb animals, which are devoid of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, were commanded to be slain on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the Amalekites (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>). Therefore vengeance is sometimes taken on those who have deserved it involuntarily.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, compulsion is most opposed to voluntariness. But a man does not escape the debt of punishment through being compelled by fear to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore vengeance is sometimes taken on those who have deserved it involuntarily.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk005.htm">Luke 5</a> that "the ship in which <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> was, was in distress"; wherefore "Peter, who was calm in the security of his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, was in distress about those of others." But Peter did not will the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sometimes punished without having <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> deserved it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Punishment is due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. iii; Retract. i). Therefore vengeance should be taken only on those who have deserved it <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Punishment may be considered in two ways. First, under the aspect of punishment, and in this way punishment is not due save for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because by means of punishment the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is restored, in so far as he who by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> has exceeded in following his own will suffers something that is contrary to this will. Wherefore, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, not excluding <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, as stated above (I-II, 81, 1), it follows that no one is punished in this way, except for something done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Secondly, punishment may be considered as a medicine, not only healing the past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also preserving from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or conducing to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in this way a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is sometimes punished without any fault of his own, yet not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>It must, however, be observed that a medicine never removes a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in order to promote a lesser; thus the medicine of the body never blinds the eye, in order to repair the heel: yet sometimes it is harmful in lesser things that it may be helpful in things of greater consequence. And since <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods are of the greatest consequence, while temporal goods are least important, sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is punished in his temporal goods without any fault of his own. Such are many of the punishments inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this present life for our humiliation or probation. But no one is punished in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods without any fault on his part, neither in this nor in the future life, because in the latter punishment is not medicinal, but a result of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> condemnation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is never condemned to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishment for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishment affects the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in respect of which each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of himself. But sometimes a man is condemned to punishment in temporal matters for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another, and this for three reasons. First, because one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be the temporal goods of another, and so he may be punished in punishment of the latter: thus children, as to the body, are a belonging of their father, and slaves are a possession of their master. Secondly, when one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted to another, either by "imitation," as children copy the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their parents, and slaves the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their masters, so as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with greater daring; or by way of "<a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> subjects <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> superior, according to <a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse30">Job 34:30</a>, "Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people?" Hence the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were punished for David's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in numbering the people (<a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#verse24">2 Samuel 24</a>). This may also happen through some kind of "consent" or "connivance": thus sometimes even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are punished in temporal matters together with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for not having condemned their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 9). Thirdly, in order to mark the unity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fellowship, whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to be solicitous for another, lest he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in order to inculcate horror of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seeing that the punishment of one affects all, as though all were one body, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Achan (QQ. sup. Josue viii). The saying of the Lord, "Visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation," seems to belong to mercy rather than to severity, since He does not take vengeance forthwith, but waits for some future time, in order that the descendants at least may mend their ways; yet should the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the descendants increase, it becomes almost <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to take vengeance on them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (QQ. sup. Josue viii), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment should conform to the divine judgment, when this is manifest, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> condemns men spiritually for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment cannot be conformed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> hidden judgments, whereby He punishes certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in temporal matters without any fault of theirs, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to grasp the reasons of these judgments so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is expedient for each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Wherefore according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment a man should never be condemned without fault of his own to an inflictive punishment, such as death, mutilation or flogging. But a man may be condemned, even according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, to a punishment of forfeiture, even without any fault on his part, but not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and this in three ways.

<p>First, through a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> becoming, without any fault of his, disqualified for having or acquiring a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: thus for being infected with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> a man is removed from the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and for <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">bigamy</a>, or through pronouncing a death sentence a man is hindered from receiving sacred orders.

<p>Secondly, because the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he forfeits is not his own but common property: thus that an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> see be attached to a certain church belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole city, and not only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may depend on the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another: thus in the crime of high treason a son loses his inheritance through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his parent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> children are punished in temporal matters together with their parents, both because they are a possession of their parents, so that their parents are punished also in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and because this is for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> lest, should they be spared, they might imitate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their parents, and thus deserve to be punished still more severely. Vengeance is wrought on dumb animals and any other irrational creatures, because in this way their owners are punished; and also in horror of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An act done through compulsion of fear is not involuntary simply, but has an admixture of voluntariness, as stated above (I-II, 06, A5,6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were distressed about the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, in the same way as the multitude is punished for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one, in commendation of unity, as state above (Reply to Objection1,2).
