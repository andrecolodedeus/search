<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether without grace man can know any truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, on <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can say, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by whomsoever spoken is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in us by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Solil. i, 6) that "the most certain <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are like things lit up by the sun so as to be seen. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is He Whom sheds the light. And reason is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as sight is in the eye. And the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> are the senses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now the bodily senses, however pure, cannot see any visible object, without the sun's light. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, however perfect, cannot, by reasoning, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without Divine light: and this pertains to the aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind can only understand <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by thinking, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 7). But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>): "Not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot, of himself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 4): "I do not approve having said in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who dost wish the sinless alone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for it may be answered that many who are not sinless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse12">Psalm 50:12</a>: "Create a clean heart in me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and renew a right spirit within my bowels." Therefore without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of himself can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a use or act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse13">Ephesians 5:13</a>): "All that is made manifest is light." Now every use implies movement, taking movement broadly, so as to call thinking and willing movements, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 4). Now in corporeal things we see that for movement there is required not merely the form which is the principle of the movement or action, but there is also required the motion of the first mover. Now the first mover in the order of corporeal things is the heavenly body. Hence no matter how perfectly fire has heat, it would not bring about alteration, except by the motion of the heavenly body. But it is clear that as all corporeal movements are reduced to the motion of the heavenly body as to the first corporeal mover, so all movements, both corporeal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, are reduced to the simple First Mover, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence no matter how perfect a corporeal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is supposed to be, it cannot proceed to its act unless it be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but this motion is according to the plan of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and not by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the motion of the heavenly body. Now not only is every motion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from the First Mover, but all formal perfection is from Him as from the First Act. And thus the act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> being whatsoever depends upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways: first, inasmuch as it is from Him that it has the form whereby it acts; secondly, inasmuch as it is moved by Him to act.

<p>Now every form bestowed on <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has power for a determined act, which it can bring about in proportion to its own proper endowment; and beyond which it is powerless, except by a superadded form, as water can only heat when heated by the fire. And thus the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding has a form, viz. intelligible light, which of itself is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> certain intelligible things, viz. those we can come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through the senses. Higher intelligible things of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, unless it be perfected by a stronger light, viz. the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which is called the "light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," inasmuch as it is added to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Hence we must say that for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whatsoever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs Divine help, that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to its act. But he does not need a new light added to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light, in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in all things, but only in some that surpass his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And yet at times <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> instructs some by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, even as He sometimes brings about <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by whomsoever spoken is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as bestowing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light, and moving us to understand and speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but not as dwelling in us by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, or as bestowing any <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For this only takes place with regard to certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and spoken, and especially in regard to such as pertain to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The material sun sheds its light outside us; but the intelligible Sun, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shines within us. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> enlightenment, whereby we are enlightened to see what pertains to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and for this there is required no further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but only for such things as surpass <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We always need <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help for every thought, inasmuch as He moves the understanding to act; for actually to understand anything is to think, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xiv, 7).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether man can wish or do any good without grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can wish and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For that is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, whereof he is master. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his acts, and especially of his willing, as stated above (1, 1; 13, 6). Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of himself, can wish and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has more power over what is according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than over what is beyond his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 30); whereas <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above (Question 71, Article 1). Therefore since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of himself he can wish and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the understanding's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 2). Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can of itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even as every other thing can work its own operation of itself. Therefore, much more can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of himself, do and wish <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a>): "It is not of him that willeth," namely, to will, "nor of him that runneth," namely to run, "but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that showeth mercy." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Corrept. et Gratia ii) that "without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men do nothing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when they either think or wish or love or act."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be looked at in two ways: first, in its integrity, as it was in our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; secondly, as it is corrupted in us after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>. Now in both states <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> needs the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as First Mover, to do or wish any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whatsoever, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But in the state of integrity, as regards the sufficiency of the operative power, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments could wish and do the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proportionate to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but not surpassing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> falls short of what he could do by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that he is unable to fulfil it by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. Yet because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not altogether corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so as to be shorn of every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even in the state of corrupted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it can, by virtue of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, work some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as to build dwellings, plant vineyards, and the like; yet it cannot do all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it, so as to fall short in nothing; just as a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can of himself make some movements, yet he cannot be perfectly moved with the movements of one in health, unless by the help of medicine he be cured.

<p>And thus in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a gratuitous strength superadded to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> strength for one reason, viz. in order to do and wish <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but for two reasons, in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, viz. in order to be healed, and furthermore in order to carry out works of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Beyond this, in both states <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs the Divine help, that he may be moved to act well.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is master of his acts and of his willing or not willing, because of his deliberate reason, which can be bent to one side or another. And although he is master of his deliberating or not deliberating, yet this can only be by a previous deliberation; and since it cannot go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, we must come at length to this, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is moved by an extrinsic principle, which is above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, to wit by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves in the chapter "On Good Fortune" (Ethic. Eudem. vii). Hence the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> still unweakened is not so much master of its act that it does not need to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and much more the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> weakened by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby it is hindered from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than to fail in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which belongs to any being according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now as every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing has its being from another, and, considered in itself, is nothing, so does it need to be preserved by another in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which pertains to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For it can of itself fail in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, even as of itself it can fall into non-existence, unless it is upheld by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man cannot even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without Divine help, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). And yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is more corrupt by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in regard to the desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, than in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether by his own natural powers and without grace man can love God above all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. For to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things is the proper and principal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot of himself possess <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since the "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us," as is said <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers alone cannot love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can rise above itself. But to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things is to tend above oneself. Therefore without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above itself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Highest Good, is due the best love, which is that He be loved above all things. Now without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not capable of giving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the best love, which is His due; otherwise it would be useless to add <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and with his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers alone, cannot love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As some maintain, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was first made with only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments; and in this state it is manifest that he loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to some extent. But he did not love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> equally with himself, or less than himself, otherwise he would have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Therefore he loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers alone, can love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself and above all things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (I, 60, 5), where the various opinions concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were set forth, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, could by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, do the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to him without the addition of any gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, though not without the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving him. Now to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and to every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not only rational but irrational, and even to inanimate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> according to the manner of love which can belong to each creature. And the reason of this is that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to all to seek and love things according as they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> fit (to be sought and loved) since "all things act according as they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> fit" as stated in Phys. ii, 8. Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the part is for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole; hence everything, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and love, loves its own proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> leads everything to love of Himself." Hence in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> referred the love of himself and of all other things to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to its end; and thus he loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than himself and above all things. But in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> falls short of this in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of his rational will, which, unless it is cured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, follows its private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, on account of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And hence we must say that in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not need the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> added to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, in order to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, although he needed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help to move him to it; but in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs, even for this, the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to heal his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things in a higher way than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things inasmuch as He is the beginning and the end of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves Him, as He is the object of beatitude, and inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> adds to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a certain quickness and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, in the same way that every <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> adds to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act which is done merely by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of a man who has not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When it is said that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot rise above itself, we must not understand this as if it could not be drawn to any object above itself, for it is clear that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things above itself, as is shown in our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we are to understand that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot rise to an act exceeding the proportion of its strength. Now to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things is not such an act; for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to every creature, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Love is said to be best, both with respect to degree of love, and with regard to the motive of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a>, and the mode of love. And thus the highest degree of love is that whereby <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the giver of beatitude, as was said above.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether man without grace and by his own natural powers can fulfil the commandments of the Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, can fulfil the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans 2:14</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who have not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>." Now what a man does <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> he can do of himself without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence a man can fulfil the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Expos. Cathol. Fide [Symboli Explanatio ad Damasum, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>: now ascribed to Pelagius]) that "they are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> who say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has laid impossibilities upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now what a man cannot fulfil by himself is impossible to him. Therefore a man can fulfil all the commandments of himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, of all the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the greatest is this, "Thou shalt love the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart" (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse37">Matthew 27:37</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments can fulfil this command by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can fulfil all the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Haeres. lxxxviii) that it is part of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that "they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can fulfil all the Divine commandments."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of fulfilling the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. The first regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the works, as when a man does works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And in this way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> could fulfil all the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; otherwise he would have been unable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in that state, since to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than to transgress the Divine commandments. But in the state of corrupted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot fulfil all the Divine commandments without healing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be fulfilled, not merely as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, but also as regards the mode of acting, i.e. their being done out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. And in this way, neither in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fulfil the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Corrupt. et Grat. ii) having stated that "without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men can do no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whatever," adds: "Not only do they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by its light what to do, but by its help they do lovingly what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>." Beyond this, in both states they need the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> motion in order to fulfil the commandments, as stated above (2,3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Lit. xxvii), "do not be disturbed at his saying that they do by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> those things that are of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works this, in order to restore in us the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after which we were <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> made."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What we can do with the Divine assistance is not altogether impossible to us; according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 3): "What we can do through our friends, we can do, in some sense, by ourselves." Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Symboli Explanatio ad Damasum, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>: now ascribed to Pelagius] concedes that "our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in such a way free that we must confess we still require <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man cannot, with his purely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, fulfil the precept of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether man can merit everlasting life without grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> everlasting life without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17</a>): "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments"; from which it would seem that to enter into everlasting life rests with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will. But what rests with our will, we can do of ourselves. Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> everlasting life of himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is the wage of reward bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on men, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse12">Matthew 5:12</a>: "Your reward is very great in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But wage or reward is meted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to everyone according to his works, according to <a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse12">Psalm 61:12</a>: "Thou wilt render to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works." Hence, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of his works, it seems that it is within his power to reach everlasting life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everlasting life is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Now every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments can attain its end. Much more, therefore, may <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attain to life everlasting by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting." And as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, this is said "that we may understand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His own mercy, leads us to everlasting life."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Acts conducing to an end must be proportioned to the end. But no act exceeds the proportion of its active principle; and hence we see in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, that nothing can by its operation bring about an effect which exceeds its active force, but only such as is proportionate to its power. Now everlasting life is an end exceeding the proportion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is clear from what we have said above (Question 5, Article 5). Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, cannot produce <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works proportionate to everlasting life; and for this a higher force is needed, viz. the force of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And thus without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> everlasting life; yet he can perform works conducing to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as "to toil in the fields, to drink, to eat, or to have friends," and the like, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his third Reply to the Pelagians [Hypognosticon iii, among the spurious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man, by his will, does works <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of everlasting life; but as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in the same book, for this it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be prepared with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> upon <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting," says, "It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that everlasting life is meter to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works; but the works to which it is meted, belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." And it has been said (4), that to fulfil the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, in their due way, whereby their fulfilment may be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, requires <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection has to do with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is nobler, can be raised by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to a higher end, which lower natures can nowise reach; even as a man who can recover his health by the help of medicines is better disposed to health than one who can nowise recover it, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (De Coelo ii, 12).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a man, by himself and without the external aid of grace, can prepare himself for grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by himself and without the external help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, can prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For nothing impossible is laid upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (4, ad 1). But it is written (<a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse3">Zechariah 1:3</a>): "Turn ye to Me . . . and I will turn to you." Now to prepare for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nothing more than to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of himself, and without the external help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, can prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prepares himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by doing what is in him to do, since if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does what is in him to do, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not deny him <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse11">Matthew 7:11</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Spirit "to them that ask Him." But what is in our power is in us to do. Therefore it seems to be in our power to prepare ourselves for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man needs <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to prepare for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, with equal reason will he need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to prepare himself for the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and thus to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, which is impossible. Hence it seems that we must not go beyond what was said first, viz. that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of himself and without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, can prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse1">Proverbs 16:1</a>) that "it is the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to prepare the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now an action is said to be part of a man, when he can do it by himself. Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by himself can prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John 6:44</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can come to Me except the Father, Who hath sent Me, draw him." But if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could prepare himself, he would not need to be drawn by another. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot prepare himself without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The preparation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is twofold: the first, whereby it is prepared to operate rightly and to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this preparation of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot take place without the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). There is a second way in which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will may be taken to be prepared for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself. Now in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prepare himself to receive this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to presuppose any further <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, otherwise we should go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But we must presuppose a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> inwardly or inspires the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wish. For in these two ways do we need the Divine assistance, as stated above (2,3). Now that we need the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to move us, is manifest. For since every agent acts for an end, every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must direct is effect to its end, and hence since the order of ends is according to the order of agents or movers, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must be directed to the last end by the motion of the first mover, and to the proximate end by the motion of any of the subordinate movers; as the spirit of the soldier is bent towards seeking the victory by the motion of the leader of the army--and towards following the standard of a regiment by the motion of the standard-bearer. And thus since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the First Mover, simply, it is by His motion that everything seeks to be likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its own way. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turns all to Himself." But He directs righteous men to Himself as to a special end, which they seek, and to which they wish to cling, according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse28">Psalm 72:28</a>, "it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for Me to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And that they are "turned" to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can only spring from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> having "turned" them. Now to prepare oneself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is, as it were, to be turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as, whoever has his eyes turned away from the light of the sun, prepares himself to receive the sun's light, by turning his eyes towards the sun. Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot prepare himself to receive the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> except by the gratuitous help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving him inwardly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bidden to turn himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> can only be turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turns it, according to <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse18">Jeremiah 31:18</a>: "Convert me and I shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, for Thou art the Lord, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; and <a href="../bible/lam005.htm#verse21">Lamentations 5:21</a>: "Convert us, O Lord, to Thee, and we shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man can do nothing unless moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John 15:5</a>: "Without Me, you can do nothing." Hence when a man is said to do what is in him to do, this is said to be in his power according as he is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection regards <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for which some preparation is required, since every form requires a disposition in that which is to be its subject. But in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no further motion is presupposed since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the First Mover. Hence we need not go to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to prepare his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since he does this by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. And yet he does not do this without the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving him, and drawing him to Himself, as was said above.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether man can rise from sin without the help of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For what is presupposed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, takes place without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But to rise to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is presupposed to the enlightenment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since it is written (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse14">Ephesians 5:14</a>): "Arise from the dead and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall enlighten thee." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as illness to health, as stated above (71, 1, ad 3). Now, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by force of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can rise from illness to health, without the external help of medicine, since there still remains in him the principle of life, from which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operation proceeds. Hence it seems that, with equal reason, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be restored by himself, and return from the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> without the help of external <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing can return by itself to the act befitting its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as hot water returns by itself to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> coldness, and a stone cast upwards returns by itself to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement. Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an act against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 30). Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by himself can return from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse21">Galatians 2:21</a>; Cf. <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse21">Galatians 3:21</a>): "For if there had been a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given which could give life--then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain," i.e. to no purpose. Hence with equal reason, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereby he can he justified, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died in vain," i.e. to no purpose. But this cannot fittingly be said. Therefore by himself he cannot be justified, i.e. he cannot return from a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man by himself can no wise rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transient as to the act and abiding in its guilt, as stated above (Question 87, Article 6), to rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the same as to cease the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but to rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> means that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has restored to him what he lost by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incurs a triple loss by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, as was clearly shown above (85, 1; 86, 1; 87, 1), viz. stain, corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and debt of punishment. He incurs a stain, inasmuch as he forfeits the lustre of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the deformity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Natural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is corrupted, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is disordered by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will not being subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>; and this order being overthrown, the consequence is that the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> remains disordered. Lastly, there is the debt of punishment, inasmuch as by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deserves everlasting damnation.

<p>Now it is manifest that none of these three can be restored except by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since the lustre of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> springs from the shedding of Divine light, this lustre cannot be brought back, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sheds His light anew: hence a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and this is the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Likewise, the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can only be restored, i.e. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will can only be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> draws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to Himself, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). So, too, the guilt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> can be remitted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, against Whom the offense was committed and Who is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> Judge. And thus in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is required the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, both as regards a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, and as regards the internal motion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bidden that which pertains to the act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as this act is required in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence when it is said, "Arise, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall enlighten thee," we are not to think that the complete rising from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> precedes the enlightenment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but that when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, strives to rise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he receives the light of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is not the sufficient principle of the health that is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This principle is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be restored by himself; but he requires the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be poured upon him anew, as if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were infused into a dead body for its <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is perfect, it can be restored by itself to its befitting and proportionate <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; but without exterior help it cannot be restored to what surpasses its measure. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> undone by reason of the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, remains no longer perfect, but corrupted, as stated above (<a href="#85">Article 85</a>); nor can it be restored, by itself, to its connatural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, much less to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether man without grace can avoid sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because "no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Duab. Anim. x, xi; De Libero Arbit. iii, 18). Hence if a man in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, men are corrected that they may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If therefore a man in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, correction would seem to be given to no purpose; which is absurd.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse18">Sirach 15:18</a>): "Before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is life and death, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; that which he shall choose shall be given him." But by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> no one ceases to be a man. Hence it is still in his power to choose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perfect Just. xxi): "Whoever denies that we ought to say the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> 'Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>' (and they deny it who maintain that the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is enough for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will) ought without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to be removed beyond all hearing, and to be anathematized by the tongues of all."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways: first, in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, in the state of corrupted <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, could avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> either mortally or venially; since to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing else than to stray from what is according to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--and in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could avoid this. Nevertheless he could not have done it without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help to uphold him in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since if this had been withdrawn, even his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would have fallen back into nothingness.

<p>But in the state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to heal his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in order that he may entirely abstain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And in the present life this healing is wrought in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>--the carnal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being not yet restored. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse25">Romans 7:25</a>) says in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of one who is restored: "I myself, with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, serve the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but with the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." And in this state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can abstain from all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which takes its stand in his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (Question 74, Article 5); but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot abstain from all venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of the corruption of his lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> of sensuality. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can, indeed, repress each of its movements (and hence they are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>), but not all, because whilst he is resisting one, another may arise, and also because the reason is always alert to avoid these movements, as was said above (74, 3, ad 2).

<p>So, too, before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason, wherein is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is restored by justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he can avoid each mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for a time, since it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he should be always actually <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. But it cannot be that he remains for a long time without mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Super Ezech. Hom. xi) that " a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not at once taken away by repentance, by its weight drags us down to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>": and this because, as the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> ought to be subject to the reason, so should the reason be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should place in Him the end of its will. Now it is by the end that all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> ought to be regulated, even as it is by the judgment of the reason that the movements of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> should be regulated. And thus, even as inordinate movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot help occurring since the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not subject to reason, so likewise, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason is not entirely subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the consequence is that many disorders occur in the reason. For when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart is not so fixed on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to be unwilling to be parted from Him for the sake of finding any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or avoiding any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, many things happen for the achieving or avoiding of which a man strays from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and breaks His commandments, and thus <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally: especially since, when surprised, a man acts according to his preconceived end and his pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii); although with premeditation of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> a man may do something outside the order of his preconceived end and the inclination of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. But because a man cannot always have this premeditation, it cannot help occurring that he acts in accordance with his will turned aside from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he is quickly brought back to the due order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man can avoid each but not every act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above. Nevertheless, since it is by his own shortcoming that he does not prepare himself to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the fact that he cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not excuse him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Correction is useful "in order that out of the sorrow of correction may spring the wish to be regenerate; if indeed he who is corrected is a son of promise, in such sort that whilst the noise of correction is outwardly resounding and punishing, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by hidden inspirations is inwardly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> to will," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Corr. et Gratia vi). Correction is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, from the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is required in order to abstain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; yet it is not sufficient without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse14">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>): "Consider the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct whom He hath despised."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Hypognosticon iii [Among the spurious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>]), this saying is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, when as yet he was not a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence he was able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, too, whatever a man wills, is given to him; but his willing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he has by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether one who has already obtained grace, can, of himself and without further help of grace, do good and avoid sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that whoever has already obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, can by himself and without further help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a thing is useless or imperfect, if it does not fulfil what it was given for. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to us that we may do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and keep from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence if with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot do this, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is either useless or imperfect.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> dwells in us, according to <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwelleth in you?" Now since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, He is sufficient to ensure our doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to keep us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence a man who has obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can do the above two things without any further assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man who has obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needs further aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to live righteously and to keep free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with equal reason, will he need yet another <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even though he has obtained this first help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore we must go on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; which is impossible. Hence whoever is in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needs no further help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to do righteously and to keep free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Natura et Gratia xxvi) that "as the eye of the body though most healthy cannot see unless it is helped by the brightness of light, so, neither can a man, even if he is most righteous, live righteously unless he be helped by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But justification is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24</a>: "Being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Hence even a man who already possesses <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needs a further assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to live righteously.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), in order to live righteously a man needs a twofold help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--first, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> whereby corrupted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is healed, and after being healed is lifted up so as to work <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> meritoriously of everlasting life, which exceed the capability of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to act.

<p>Now with regard to the first kind of help, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not need a further help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, e.g. a further infused <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Yet he needs the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in another way, i.e. in order to be moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to act righteously, and this for two reasons: first, for the general reason that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing can put forth any act, unless by virtue of the Divine motion. Secondly, for this special reason--the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For although healed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet it remains corrupted and poisoned in the flesh, whereby it serves "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse25">Romans 7:25</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, too, there seems the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, whereby, as is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans 8:26</a>): "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought"; since on account of the various turns of circumstances, and because we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ourselves perfectly, we cannot fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is for our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>: "For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful and our counsels uncertain." Hence we must be guided and guarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and can do all things. For which reason also it is becoming in those who have been born again as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to say: "Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>," and "Thy Will be done on earth as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," and whatever else is contained in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> pertaining to this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not therefore given to us that we may no longer need the Divine help; for every creature needs to be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> received from Him. Hence if after having received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> still needs the Divine help, it cannot be concluded that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to no purpose, or that it is imperfect, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will need the Divine help even in the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> shall be fully perfected. But here <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is to some extent imperfect, inasmuch as it does not completely heal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which moves and protects, is not circumscribed by the effect of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in us; but beyond this effect He, together with the Father and the Son, moves and protects us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument merely proves that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs no further <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether man possessed of grace needs the help of grace in order to persevere?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possessed of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needs no help to persevere. For perseverance is something less than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 7,9). Now since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he needs no further help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Much less, therefore, does he need the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to have perseverance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused at once. But perseverance is put down as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it seems that, together with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, perseverance is given to the other infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a>) more was restored to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, than he had lost by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> received what enabled him to persevere; and thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order to persevere.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Persev. ii): "Why is perseverance besought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it is not bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? For is it not a mocking request to seek what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> He does not give, and what is in our power without His giving it?" Now perseverance is besought by even those who are hallowed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this is seen, when we say "Hallowed be Thy name," which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> confirms by the words of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (De Correp. et Grat. xii). Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even when possessed of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, needs perseverance to be given to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Perseverance is taken in three ways. First, to signify a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> whereby a man stands steadfastly, lest he be moved by the assault of sadness from what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. And thus perseverance is to sadness as <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and pleasure, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7). Secondly, perseverance may be called a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, whereby a man has the purpose of persevering in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto the end. And in both these ways perseverance is infused together with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are. Thirdly, perseverance is called the abiding in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the end of life. And in order to have this perseverance <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not, indeed, need another <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but he needs the Divine assistance guiding and guarding him against the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as appears from the preceding article. And hence after anyone has been justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he still needs to beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of perseverance, that he may be kept from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> till the end of his life. For to many <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to whom perseverance in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection regards the first mode of perseverance, as the second objection regards the second.

<p>Hence the solution of the second objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Natura et Gratia xliii) [Cf. De Correp. et Grat. xii]: "in the original state <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> received a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> whereby he could persevere, but to persevere was not given him. But now, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, many receive both the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby they may persevere, and the further <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of persevering," and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is greater than <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> fault. Nevertheless it was easier for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to persevere, with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the state of innocence in which the flesh was not rebellious against the spirit, than it is now. For the restoration by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although it is already begun in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is not yet completed in the flesh, as it will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not merely be able to persevere but will be unable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
