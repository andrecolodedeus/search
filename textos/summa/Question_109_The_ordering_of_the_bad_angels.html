<h1>Question 109. The ordering of the bad angels</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1109.htm#article1"> Are there orders among the demons?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1109.htm#article2"> Is there precedence among them?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1109.htm#article3"> Does one enlighten another?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1109.htm#article4"> Are they subject to the precedence of the good angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are orders among the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are no orders among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For order belongs to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as also mode, and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. Boni iii); and on the contrary, disorder belongs to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But there is nothing disorderly in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore in the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there are no orders.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders are contained under a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not in a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, which is defined as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> principality; for they are void of all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Therefore among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> there are no orders.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> fell from every one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders; as is commonly supposed. Therefore, if some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are said to belong to an order, as falling from that order, it would seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give them the names of each of those orders. But we never find that they are called "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>," or "Thrones," or "Dominations." Therefore on the same ground they are not to be placed in any other order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians 6:12</a>): "Our wrestling . . . is against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As explained above (108, 4,7,8), order in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is considered both according to the grade of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and according to that of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has a twofold state, the imperfect, which is that of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and the perfect, which is that of consummae <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p>If therefore we consider the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders in the light of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders, and never were. But if we consider them in relation to imperfect <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in that view the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were at the time in the orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but fell away from them, according to what was said above (Question 62, Article 3), that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But if we consider them in the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in that view they are still in those orders; because they have not lost their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>; as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Good can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (49, 3); so there is order in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as possessing a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If we consider the ordering of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who orders them, it is sacred; for He uses the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> for Himself; but on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' will it is not a sacred thing, because they abuse their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The name "<a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>" is given from the ardor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and the name "Thrones" from the Divine indwelling; and the name "Dominations" imports a certain liberty; all of which are opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and therefore these names are not given to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether among the demons there is precedence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no precedence among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For every precedence is according to some order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are wholly fallen from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore there is no precedence among them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no precedence where obedience and subjection do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. But these cannot be without concord; which is not to be found among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to the text, "Among the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> there are always contentions" (<a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse10">Proverbs 13:10</a>). Therefore there is no precedence among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> If there be precedence among them it is either according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or according to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or punishment. But it is not according to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for subjection and service do not come from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but from subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; neither is it according to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or punishment, because in that case the superior <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> the most grievously, would be subject to the inferior. Therefore there is no precedence among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> On <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a> the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "While the world lasts, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will preside over <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, men over men, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since action follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a thing, where natures are subordinate, actions also must be subordinate to each other. Thus it is in corporeal things, for as the inferior bodies by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order are below the heavenly bodies, their actions and movements are subject to the actions and movements of the heavenly bodies. Now it is plain from what we have said (1), that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order subject to others; and hence their actions are subject to the action of those above them, and this is what we mean by precedence--that the action of the subject should be under the action of the prelate. So the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> requires that there should be authority among them. This agrees too with Divine wisdom, which leaves nothing inordinate, which "reacheth from end to end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The authority of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is not founded on their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but on the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordering all things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The concord of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whereby some obey others, does not arise from mutual friendships, but from their common <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> whereby they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> men, and fight against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men to be joined to and subject to those whom they see to be stronger, in order to carry out their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not equal in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and so among them there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> precedence; which is not the case with men, who are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> equal. That the inferior are subject to the superior, is not for the benefit of the superior, but rather to their detriment; because since to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> belongs in a pre-eminent degree to unhappiness, it follows that to preside in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be more unhappy.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there is enlightenment in the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that enlightenment is in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For enlightenment means the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But one <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> can manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to another, because the superior excel in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the superior <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> can enlighten the inferior.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a body abounding in light can enlighten a body deficient in light, as the sun enlightens the moon. But the superior <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> abound in the participation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light. Therefore it seems that the superior <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> can enlighten the inferior.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Enlightenment is not without cleansing and perfecting, as stated above (Question 106, Article 1). But to cleanse does not befit the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to the words: "What can be made clean by the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>?" (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse4">Sirach 34:4</a>). Therefore neither can they enlighten.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There can be no enlightenment properly speaking among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For, as above explained (107, 2), enlightenment properly speaking is the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who enlightens every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Another kind of manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is speech, as when one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> manifests his concept to another. Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> perversity does not lead one to order another to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather to lead away from the Divine order; and so one <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> does not enlighten another; but one can make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> concept to another by way of speech.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every kind of manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is enlightenment, but only that which is above described.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to what belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> either in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, because, as above explained (55, 2; 58, 2; 79, 2), they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the first all that belongs to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. So the greater fulness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light in the superior <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that they can enlighten others.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the good angels have precedence over the bad angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no precedence over the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' precedence is especially connected with enlightenment. But the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, being darkness, are not enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not rule over the bad.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, superiors are responsible as regards negligence for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of their subjects. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore if they are subject to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it seems that negligence is to be charged to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; which cannot be admitted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' precedence follows upon the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as above explained (2). But if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> fell from every order, as is commonly said, many of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are superior to many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have no precedence over all the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ii.), that "the treacherous and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> spirit of life is ruled by the rational, pious, and just spirit of life"; and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv) that "the Powers are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to whose charge are subjected the hostile powers."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The whole order of precedence is first and originally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it is shared by creatures accordingly as they are the nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For those creatures, which are more perfect and nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have the power to act on others. Now the greatest perfection and that which brings them nearest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs to the creatures who enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; of which perfection the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are deprived; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have precedence over the bad, and these are ruled by them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Many things concerning Divine mysteries are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whenever the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> requires the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to do anything for the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or for the trial of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs the judge's assessors make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his sentence to the executioners. This <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, if compared to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> revealers, can be called an enlightenment, forasmuch as they direct it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it is not an enlightenment on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, for these do not direct it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but to the fulfilment of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the ministers of the Divine wisdom. Hence as the Divine wisdom permits some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be done by bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that follows; so also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not entirely restrain the bad from inflicting harm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who is inferior in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order presides over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, although these may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> superior; because the power of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cleave, is stronger than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence likewise among men, "the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 4; x, 5) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the rule and measure of all <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>."
