<h1>Question 109. Truth</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3109.htm#article1"> Is truth a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3109.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3109.htm#article3"> Is it a part of justice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3109.htm#article4"> Does it incline to that which is less?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether truth is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the first of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whose object is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since then the object precedes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> and the act, it seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but something prior to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that a man should state things concerning himself to be neither more nor less than they are. But this is not always praiseworthy--neither in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, since according to <a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse2">Proverbs 27:2</a>, "Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth"--nor even in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, because it is written in condemnation of certain people (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a>): "They have proclaimed abroad their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as Sodom, and they have not hid it." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either theological, or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, or moral. Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because its object is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but temporal things. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that by "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we faithfully represent things as they are were, or will be." Likewise it is not one of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but their end. Nor again is it a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is not a mean between excess and deficiency, for the more one tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the better it is. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> both in the Second and in the Fourth Book of Ethics places <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Truth can be taken in two ways. First, for that by reason of which a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but the object or end of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because, taken in this way, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is the genus containing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but a certain equality between the understanding or sign and the thing understood or signified, or again between a thing and its rule, as stated in I, 16, 1; I, 21, 2. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may stand for that by which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> says what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in which sense one is said to be truthful. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or truthfulness must needs be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because to say what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act: and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and renders his action <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the first sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To state that which concerns oneself, in so far as it is a statement of what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> generically. Yet this does not suffice for it to be an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is requisite for that purpose that it should also be clothed with the due circumstances, and if these be not observed, the act will be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Accordingly it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to praise oneself without due <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> even for that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: and it is also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to publish one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by praising oneself on that account, or in any way proclaiming it uselessly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who says what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, utters certain signs which are in conformity with things; and such signs are either words, or external actions, or any external thing. Now such kinds of things are the subject-<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> alone, for the latter are concerned with the use of the external members, in so far as this use is put into effect at the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is neither a theological, nor an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, but a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And it is a mean between excess and deficiency in two ways. First, on the part of the object, secondly, on the part of the act. On the part of the object, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> denotes a kind of equality, and equal is a mean between more and less. Hence for the very reason that a man says what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> about himself, he observes the mean between one that says more than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about himself, and one that says less than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. On the part of the act, to observe the mean is to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when one ought, and as one ought. Excess consists in making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> one's own affairs out of season, and deficiency in hiding them when one ought to make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether truth is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are convertible. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in fact every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, because "it makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what belongs to oneself is an act of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as we understand it here. But this belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its own act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby one lives aright, and of which it is written (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse3">Isaiah 38:3</a>): "I beseech Thee . . . remember how I have walked before Thee in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with a perfect heart." Now one lives aright by any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as follows from the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> given above (I-II, 55, 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to be the same as simplicity, since hypocrisy is opposed to both. But simplicity is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it rectifies the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and that is required in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore neither is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is numbered together with other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Ethic. ii, 7).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in making a man's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently whenever we find a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be disposed thereto by a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And since according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nat. Boni iii) <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in order, it follows that a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will be found where there is a special order. Now there is a special order whereby our externals, whether words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, are duly ordered in relation to some thing, as sign to thing signified: and thereto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfected by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are convertible as to subject, since every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But considered <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, they exceed one another, even as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will exceed one another. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and many things besides, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and many others. Wherefore the "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" considered in its proper aspect as a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is a particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it is something appetible: and in like manner the "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" considered in its proper aspect as the end of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since it is something intelligible. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> includes the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is possible for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, just as the "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" is a special <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; yet it is not possible for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since rather, considered <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, it is the genus of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from what is directly intended, and not from that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now that a man states that which concerns himself, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as something directly intended: although it may belong to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> consequently and beside his principal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. For the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends to act bravely: and that he shows his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> by acting bravely is a consequence beside his principal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby a thing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> says what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Life like anything else is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, from the fact that it attains its rule and measure, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>; since rectitude of life depends on conformity to that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or rectitude is common to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Simplicity is so called from its opposition to duplicity, whereby, to wit, a man shows one thing outwardly while having another in his heart: so that simplicity pertains to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And it rectifies the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not indeed directly (since this belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>), but by excluding duplicity, whereby a man pretends one thing and intends another.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether truth is a part of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For it seems proper to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to give another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his due. But, by telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one does not seem to give another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his due, as is the case in all the foregoing parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 58, Article 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is threefold, namely, "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life," "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," and "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of doctrine." But none of these is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life comprises all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (2, ad 3): <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that it is not one of its parts; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of doctrine belongs rather to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is nowise a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among the parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#80">Article 80</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is annexed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as secondary to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through having something in common with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, while falling short from the perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thereof. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has two things in common with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. On the first place it is directed to another, since the manifestation, which we have stated to be an act of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is directed to another, inasmuch as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> manifests to another the things that concern himself. On the second place, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> sets up a certain equality between things, and this the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does also, for it equals signs to the things which concern <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. Nevertheless it falls short of the proper aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as to the notion of debt: for this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not regard legal debt, which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considers, but rather the moral debt, in so far as, out of equity, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes another a manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, being annexed thereto as a secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to its principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a social animal, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> owes another whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society. Now it would be impossible for men to live together, unless they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> one another, as declaring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> one to another. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does, in a manner, regard something as being due.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Truth, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by his own will, whereby he uses both <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and members, utters external signs in order to manifest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in this way the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which we are speaking now differs from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life, as stated in the preceding 2, ad 3.

<p>We speak of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in two ways. On one way we refer to the fact that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> itself is a certain rectitude regulated according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>; and in this way the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life, because by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life a man lives aright in himself, whereas by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a man observes the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in those judgments which refer to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and in this sense the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which we speak now, as neither has the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life. On another way the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be understood as referring to the fact that, out of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, a man manifests the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as for instance when a man confesses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or gives <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> evidence in a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a particular act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and does not pertain directly to this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which we are now speaking, because, to wit, in this manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a man's chief <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is to give another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his due. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) in describing this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: "We are not speaking of one who is truthful in his agreements, nor does this apply to matters in which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is questioned."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of doctrine consists in a certain manifestation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> relating to science wherefore neither does this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> directly pertain to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby a man, both in life and in speech, shows himself to be such as he is, and the things that concern him, not other, and neither greater nor less, than they are. Nevertheless since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of science, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us, are something concerning us, and pertain to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in this sense the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of doctrine may pertain to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as well as any other kind of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby a man manifests, by word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the virtue of truth inclines rather to that which is less?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not incline to that which is less. For as one incurs falsehood by saying more, so does one by saying less: thus it is no more <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that four are five, than that four are three. But "every falsehood is in itself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to be avoided," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. iv, 7). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not incline to that which is less rather than to that which is greater.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> inclines to the one extreme rather than to the other, is owing to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> mean is nearer to the one extreme than to the other: thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is nearer to daring than to timidity. But the mean of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not nearer to one extreme than to the other; because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since it is a kind of equality, holds to the exact mean. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not more incline to that which is less.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to forsake the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for that which is less seems to amount to a denial of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since this is to subtract therefrom; and to forsake the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for that which is greater seems to amount to an addition thereto. Now to deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is more repugnant to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than to add something to it, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is incompatible with the denial of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereas it is compatible with addition. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should incline to that which is greater rather than to that which is less.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "by this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> a man declines rather from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> towards that which is less."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two ways of declining from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to that which is less. First, by affirming, as when a man does not show the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is in him, for instance science, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and so forth. This is done without prejudice to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since the lesser is contained in the greater: and in this way this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> inclines to what is less. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7), "this seems to be more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> because exaggerations give annoyance." For those who represent themselves as being greater than they are, are a source of annoyance to others, since they seem to wish to surpass others: whereas those who make less account of themselves are a source of pleasure, since they seem to defer to others by their moderation. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 12:6</a>): "Though I should have a mind to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But I forbear, lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should think of me above that which he seeth in me or anything he heareth from me."

<p>Secondly, one may incline to what is less by denying, so as to say that what is in us is not. On this way it does not belong to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to incline to what is less, because this would imply falsehood. And yet this would be less repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not indeed as regards the proper aspect of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but as regards the aspect of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which should be safeguarded in all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For since it is fraught with greater danger and is more annoying to others, it is more repugnant to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to think or boast that one has what one has not, than to think or say that one has not what one has.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
