<h1>Question 10. The beatific knowledge of Christ's soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4010.htm#article1"> Did the soul of Christ comprehend the Word or the Divine Essence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4010.htm#article2"> Did it know all things in the Word?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4010.htm#article3"> Did the soul of Christ know the infinite in the Word?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4010.htm#article4"> Did it see the Word or the Divine Essence clearer than did any other creature?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul of Christ comprehended the Word or the Divine Essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> comprehended and comprehends the Word or Divine Essence. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono i, 3) that "the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to Itself and to the Man assumed." Therefore the Man assumed communicates with the Holy <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> in that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of Itself which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>. Now this is the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of comprehension. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> comprehends the Divine Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in personal being is greater than to be united by vision. But as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6), "the whole Godhead in one Person is united to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore much more is the whole Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> seen by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ; and hence it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> comprehended the Divine Essence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what belongs by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> belongs by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 13). But to comprehend the Divine Essence belongs by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Therefore it belongs by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; and thus it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> comprehended the Divine Essence by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 14): "Whatsoever comprehends itself is finite to itself." But the Divine Essence is not finite with respect to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since It <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> exceeds it. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not comprehend the Word.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is plain from 2, 1,6, the union of the two natures in the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took place in such a way that the properties of both natures remained unconfused, i.e. "the uncreated remained uncreated, and the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> remained within the limits of the creature," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3,4). Now it is impossible for any creature to comprehend the Divine Essence, as was shown in I, 12, 1,4,7, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not comprehended by the finite. And hence it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> nowise comprehends the Divine Essence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Man assumed is reckoned with the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of Itself, not indeed as regards comprehension, but by reason of a certain most excellent <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> above the rest of creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not even in the union by personal being does the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> comprehend the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> or the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, for although it was wholly united to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the one Person of the Son, yet the whole power of the Godhead was not circumscribed by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was united to flesh in such a manner as to quit or lose the care of the world's government, neither did He narrow or reduce it when He transferred it to that little body." So likewise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sees the whole Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet does not comprehend It; since it does not see It totally, i.e. not as perfectly as It is knowable, as was said in I, 12, 7.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, by reason of which all that is said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is also said of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> on account of the identity of suppositum. And in this way it may be said that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is a comprehensor of the Divine Essence, not indeed by His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; even as we may also say that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the Son of God knew all things in the Word?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things in the Word. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark 13:32</a>): "But of that day or hour no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> nor the Son, but the Father." Therefore He does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things in the Word.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more perfectly anyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a principle the more he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in the principle. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees His Essence more perfectly than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does. Therefore He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> in the Word. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things in the Word.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the extent depends on the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> in the Word all that the Word <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, it would follow that the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would equal the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> would equal the uncreated, which is impossible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse12">Apocalypse 5:12</a>, "The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive . . . divinity and wisdom," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, i.e. "the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When it is inquired whether <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all things in the Word, "all things" may be taken in two ways: First, properly, to stand for all that in any way whatsoever is, will be, or was done, said, or thought, by whomsoever and at any time. And in this way it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all things in the Word. For every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in the Word, not all simply, but so many more things the more perfectly it sees the Word. Yet no beatified <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> fails to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in the Word whatever pertains to itself. Now to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and to His dignity all things to some extent belong, inasmuch as all things are subject to Him. Moreover, He has been appointed Judge of all by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>," as is said <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse27">John 5:27</a>; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> in the Word all things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in whatever time, and the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of which He is the Judge, so that what is said of Him (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse25">John 2:25</a>), "For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," can be understood not merely of the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a>, but also of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, which it had in the Word. Secondly, "all things" may be taken widely, as extending not merely to such things as are in act at some time, but even to such things as are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and never have been nor ever will be reduced to act. Now some of these are in the Divine power alone, and not all of these does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> in the Word. For this would be to comprehend all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could do, which would be to comprehend the Divine power, and, consequently, the Divine Essence. For every power is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all it can do. Some, however, are not only in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also in the power of the creature; and all of these the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> in the Word; for it comprehends in the Word the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of every creature, and, consequently, its power and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and all things that are in the power of the creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius understood this saying, not of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which they did not hold to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said above (Question 9, Article 1), but of the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Divine knowledge</a> of the Son, Whom they held to be less than the Father as regards <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. But this will not stand, since all things were made by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as is said <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John 1:3</a>, and, amongst other things, all times were made by Him. Now He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of anything that was made by Him.

<p>He is said, therefore, not to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the day and the hour of the Judgment, for that He does not make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, since, on being asked by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts 1:7</a>), He was unwilling to reveal it; and, on the contrary, we read (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse12">Genesis 22:12</a>): "Now I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that thou fearest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," i.e. "Now I have made thee <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>." But the Father is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because He imparted this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Hence, by saying but the Father, we are given to understand that the Son <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, not merely in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but also in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> argues (Hom. lxxviii in Matth.), if it is given to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> how to judge--which is greater--much more is it given to Him to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the less, viz. the time of Judgment. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, however (in Matth. Tract. xxx), expounds it of His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this time. Lastly, some say this is to be understood of the adoptive, and not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His Essence so much the more perfectly than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as He comprehends it. And hence He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all things, not merely whatever are in act at any time, which things He is said to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision, but also what ever He Himself can do, which He is said to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> by simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as was shown in I, 14, 9. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in Himself by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision, but not all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> in Himself by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; and thus in Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many more things than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The extent of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> depends not merely on the number of knowable things, but also on the clearness of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore, although the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which He has in the Word is equal to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision as regards the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> exceeds the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in clearness of cognition, since the uncreated light of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> exceeds any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light received by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ; although, absolutely speaking, the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> exceeds the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only as regards the mode of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a>, but also as regards the number of things <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a>, as was stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the soul of Christ can know the infinite in the Word?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in the Word. For that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> should be <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> is repugnant to the definition of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> which (Phys. iii, 63) is said to be that "from which, however much we may take, there always remains something to be taken." But it is impossible for the definition to be separated from the thing defined, since this would mean that contradictories <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together. Therefore it is impossible that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because its capacity is finite, since it is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there can be nothing greater than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But more is contained in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, absolutely speaking, than in the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all its power and all it can do. Now it can cleanse <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>: "He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> regards only being, since being and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are convertible. Now a thing is said to be a being in two ways: First, simply, i.e. whatever is a being in act; secondly, relatively, i.e. whatever is a being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. And because, as is said Metaph. ix, 20, everything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as it is in act, and not as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> primarily and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> regards being in act, and secondarily regards being in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, which is not knowable of itself, but inasmuch as that in whose power it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence, with regard to the first mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Because there is not an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number in act, even though we were to reckon all that are in act at any time whatsoever, since the state of generation and corruption will not last for ever: consequently there is a certain number not only of things lacking generation and corruption, but also of things capable of generation and corruption. But with regard to the other mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things in the Word, for it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), all that is in the power of the creature. Hence, since in the power of the creature there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things, it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as it were, by a certain <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, and not by a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we said in I, 8, 1, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is taken in two ways. First, on the part of a form, and thus we have the negatively <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, i.e. a form or act not limited by being received into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or a subject; and this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> of itself is most knowable on account of the perfection of the act, although it is not comprehensible by the finite power of the creature; for thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, yet does not comprehend. Secondly, there is the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as regards <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is taken privatively, i.e. inasmuch as it has not the form it ought <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to have, and in this way we have <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. Now such an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> of itself, is unknown: inasmuch as it is, as it were, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with privation of form as is said Phys. iii, 65. But all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is by form or act. Therefore if this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according to its mode of being, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For its mode is that part be taken after part, as is said Phys. iii, 62,63. And in this way it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, if we take something from it, i.e. taking part after part, there always remains something to be taken. But as material things can be received by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> immaterially, and many things unitedly, so can <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things be received by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not after the manner of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but finitely; and thus what are in themselves <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> are, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the knower, finite. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> them not by discoursing from one to another, but in a certain unity, i.e. in any creature in whose <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, and principally in the Word Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is nothing to hinder a thing from being <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in one way and finite in another, as when in quantities we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a surface <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in length and finite in breadth. Hence, if there were an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they would have a relative <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, i.e. in multitude; but, as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, they would be finite, since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of all would be limited to one specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But what is simply <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was said in I, 7, 2. Now the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is "what a thing is," as is said De Anima iii, 26, to which pertains the notion of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since it has a finite capacity, attains to, but does not comprehend, what is simply <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as stated above (1). But the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> which is in creatures can be comprehended by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since it is compared to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in which respect it is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For even our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands a universal--for example, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which in a manner has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, inasmuch as it can be predicated of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in every way can be but one. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Coel. i, 2,3,) that, since bodies have dimensions in every part, there cannot be several <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> bodies. Yet if anything were <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in one way only, nothing would hinder the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of several such <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things; as if we were to suppose several lines of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> length drawn on a surface of finite breadth. Hence, because <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to things that are said to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iii, 37,38); as the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is multiplied by different subjects, so, too, a property of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> must be multiplied, in such a way that it belongs to each of them according to that particular subject. Now it is a property of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> that nothing is greater than it. Hence, if we take one <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> line, there is nothing greater in it than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; so, too, if we take any one of other <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> lines, it is plain that each has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> parts. Therefore of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in this particular line there is nothing greater than all these <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> parts; yet in another or a third line there will be more <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> parts besides these. We observe this in numbers also, for the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of even numbers are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of odd numbers are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; yet there are more even and odd numbers than even. And thus it must be said that nothing is greater than the simply and in every way <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; but than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> which is limited in some respect, nothing is greater in that order; yet we may suppose something greater outside that order. In this way, therefore, there are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the creature, and yet there are more in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than in the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> of the creature. So, too, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things by the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more by this manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or understanding.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the soul of Christ sees the Word or the Divine Essence more clearly than does any other creature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not see the Word more perfectly than does any other creature. For the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> depends upon the medium of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we have by means of a demonstrative syllogism is more perfect than that which we have by means of a probable syllogism. But all the blessed see the Word immediately in the Divine Essence Itself, as was said in I, 12, 2. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not see the Word more perfectly than any other creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the perfection of vision does not exceed the power of seeing. But the rational power of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such as is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is below the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iv). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not see the Word more perfectly than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees His Word <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more perfectly than does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence there are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> possible mediate degrees between the manner in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees His Word, and the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sees the Word. Therefore we cannot assert that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sees the Word or the Divine Essence more perfectly than does every other creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse20">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "on His right hand in the heavenly places, above all principality and power and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come." But in that heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the higher anyone is the more perfectly does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more perfectly than does any other creature.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The vision of the Divine Essence is granted to all the blessed by a partaking of the Divine light which is shed upon them from the fountain of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse5">Sirach 1:5</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> on high is the fountain of Wisdom." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since it is united to the Word in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is more closely joined to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> than any other creature. Hence it more fully receives the light in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by the Word Himself than any other creature. And therefore more perfectly than the rest of creatures it sees the First Truth itself, which is the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "And we saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father," "full" not only of "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>" but also of "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, on the part of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, depends on the medium; but as regards the knower, it depends on the power or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. And hence it is that even amongst men one sees a conclusion in a medium more perfectly than another does. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is filled with a more abundant light, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> the Divine Essence more perfectly than do the other blessed, although all see the Divine Essence in itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The vision of the Divine Essence exceeds the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of any creature, as was said in I, 12, 4. And hence the degrees thereof depend rather on the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is supreme, than on the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is placed before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 7, Article 12), there cannot be a greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with respect to the union with the Word; and the same is to be said of the perfection of the Divine vision; although, absolutely speaking, there could be a higher and more sublime degree by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the Divine power.
