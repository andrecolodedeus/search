<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether confession delivers one from the death of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession does not deliver one from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For confession follows <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> sufficiently blots out guilt. Therefore confession does not deliver one from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a fault, so is venial. Now confession renders venial that which was mortal before, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 17). Therefore confession does not blot out guilt, but one guilt is changed into another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Confession is part of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>. But Penance deliver from guilt. Therefore confession does also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Penance, as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is perfected chiefly in confession, because by the latter a man submits to the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> has the desire of confession united thereto, and satisfaction is enjoined according to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who hears the confession. And since in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, therefore confession in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> granted remits guilt, even as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> does. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> delivers one from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not only by being received actually, but also by being received in desire, as is evident with regard to those who approach the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a> after being already sanctified. And unless a man offers an obstacle, he receives, through the very fact of being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, if they are not already remitted. The same is to be said of confession, to which <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is added because it delivered the penitent from guilt through being previously in his desire. Afterwards at the time of actual confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> he receives an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would also be granted to him, if his previous sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not sufficient for <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, and if at the time he offered no obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently just as it is said of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> that it delivers from death, so can it be said of confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contrition has the desire of confession attached to it, and therefore it delivers penitents from death in the same way as the desire of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> delivers those who are going to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the text venial does not designate guilt, but punishment that is easily expiated. and so it does not follow that one guilt is changed into another but that it is wholly done away. For "venial" is taken in three senses [Cf. I-II, 88, 2]: first, for what is venial generically, e.g. an idle word: secondly, for what is venial in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. having within itself a motive of pardon, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> due to weakness: thirdly, for what is venial in the result, in which sense it is understood here, because the result of confession is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> past guilt is pardoned.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether confession delivers from punishment in some way?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession nowise delivers from punishment. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves no punishment but what is either <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> or temporal. Now <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> is remitted by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, and temporal punishment by satisfaction. Therefore nothing of the punishment is remitted by confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is taken for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>" [Cf. Can. Magna Pietas, De Poenit., Dist. i], as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 17). Now he that is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> has the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to confess. wherefore his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> avails him as though he had already confessed, and so the confession which he makes afterwards remits no part of the punishment.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Confession is a penal work. But all penal works expiate the punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore confession does also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confession together with <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> has the power to deliver from punishment, for two reasons. First, from the power of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> itself: and thus the very desire of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> delivers a man from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, as also from the guilt. Now this punishment is one of condemnation and total banishment: and when a man is delivered therefrom he still remains bound to a temporal punishment, in so far as punishment is a cleansing and perfecting remedy; and so this punishment remains to be suffered in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> by those who also have been delivered from the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Which temporal punishment is beyond the powers of the penitent dwelling in this world, but is so far diminished by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, that it is within the ability of the penitent, and he is able, by making satisfaction, to cleanse himself in this life. Secondly, confession diminishes the punishment in virtue of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the act of the one who confesses, for this act has the punishment of shame attached to it, so that the oftener one confesses the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the more is the punishment diminished.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not taken for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, if this is done by another, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is not worth as much as the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. But a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is taken for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, when the latter is something done by him, entirely. Again, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, but not of the removal of punishment and the like, which come under the head of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> and secondary reward. Consequently one who has confessed and received <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> will be less punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> than one who has gone no further than <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether confession opens paradise?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that confession does not open Paradise. For different <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> have different effects. But it is the effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to open Paradise. Therefore it is not the effect of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is impossible to enter by a closed door before it be opened. But a dying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> before making his confession. Therefore confession does not open Paradise.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Confession makes a man submit to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But Paradise is opened by those keys. Therefore it is opened by confession.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Guilt and the debt of punishment prevent a man from entering into Paradise: and since confession removes these obstacles, as shown above (1,2), it is said to open Paradise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Penance are different <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they act in virtue of Christ's one <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, whereby a way was opened unto Paradise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the dying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> Paradise was closed to him before he conceived the desire to confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although afterwards it was opened by <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> implying a desire for confession, even before he actually confessed. Nevertheless the obstacle of the debt of punishment was not entirely removed before confession and satisfaction.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether confession gives hope of salvation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should not be reckoned an effect of confession. For hope arises from all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> acts. Therefore, seemingly, it is not the proper effect of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we arrive at hope through tribulation, as appears from <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans 5:3-4</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffers tribulation chiefly in satisfaction. Therefore, satisfaction rather than confession gives hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong>" Confession makes a man more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and more wary," as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> states in the text (Sent. iv, D, 17). But the result of this is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> conceives a hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore it is the effect of confession to give hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can have no hope for the forgiveness of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except through Christ: and since by confession a man submits to the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which derive their power from <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, therefore do we say that confession gives hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not our actions, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Redeemer, that is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and since confession relies upon the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Redeemer, it gives hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not only as a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act, but also as part of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Tribulation gives hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by making us exercise our own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and by paying off the debt of punishment: while confession does so also in the way mentioned above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a general confession suffices to blot out forgotten mortal sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a general confession does not suffice to blot out forgotten mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to confess again a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has been blotted out by confession. If, therefore, forgotten <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven by a general confession, there would be no need to confess them when they are called to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever is not conscious of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either is not guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or has forgotten his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, therefore, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven by a general confession, whoever is not conscious of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, can be certain that he is free from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whenever he makes a general confession: which is contrary to what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>), "I am not conscious to myself of anything, yet am I not hereby justified."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> profits by neglect. Now a man cannot forget a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without neglect, before it is forgiven him. Therefore he does not profit by his forgetfulness so that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven him without special mention thereof in confession.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, that which the penitent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing about is further from his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than that which he has forgotten. Now a general confession does not blot out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, else <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are not aware that certain things they have done are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and certain simple people, would be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> by a general confession, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore a general confession does not take away forgotten <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse6">Psalm 33:6</a>): "Come ye to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be confounded." Now he who confesses all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of which he is conscious, approaches to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as much as he can: nor can more be required for him. Therefore he will not be confounded by being repelled, but will be forgiven.

<p>Further, he that confesses is pardoned unless he be insincere. But he who confesses all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that he calls to mind, is not insincere through forgetting some, because he suffers from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact, which excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore he receives forgiveness, and then the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has forgotten, are loosened, since it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to hope for half a pardon.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confession produces its effect, on the presupposition that there is <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> which blots out guilt: so that confession is directly ordained to the remission of punishment, which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in virtue of the shame which it includes, and by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> to which a man submits by confessing. Now it happens sometimes that by previous <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been blotted out as to the guilt, either in a general way (if it was not remembered at the time) or in particular (and yet is forgotten before confession): and then general sacramental confession works for the remission of the punishment in virtue of the keys, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> submits by confessing, provided he offers no obstacle so far as he is concerned: but so far as the shame of confessing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminishes its punishment, the punishment for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which a man does not express his shame, through failing to confess it to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is not diminished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In sacramental confession, not only is <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> required, but also the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who imposes satisfaction is awaited. Wherefore although the latter has given <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, nevertheless the penitent is bound to confess in order to supply what was wanting to the sacramental confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, confession does not produce its effect, unless <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> be presupposed; concerning which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, even as neither can one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain if he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Consequently a man cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain whether a forgotten <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been forgiven him in a general confession, although he may think so on account of certain conjectural signs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He does not profit by his neglect, since he does not receive such full pardon, as he would otherwise have received, nor is his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> so great. Moreover he is bound to confess the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when he calls it to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not excuse, because it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by itself: but <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact does excuse. Therefore if a man omits to confess a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, he is not excused from insincerity. on the other hand, he would be excused, if he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through being unaware of some particular circumstance, for instance, if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another's wife, thinking her his own. Now forgetfulness of an act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact, wherefore it excuses from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of insincerity in confession, which is an obstacle to the fruit of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and confession.
