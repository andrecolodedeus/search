<h1>Question 10. The eternity of God</h1>

</ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether this is a good definition of eternity, "The simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the definition of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> given by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. v) is not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one: "Eternity is the simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life." For the word "interminable" is a negative one. But negation only belongs to what is defective, and this does not belong to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore in the definition of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the word "interminable" ought not to be found.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> signifies a certain kind of duration. But duration regards <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> rather than life. Therefore the word "life" ought not to come into the definition of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but rather the word "existence."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a whole is what has parts. But this is alien to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> which is simple. Therefore it is improperly said to be "whole."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Many days cannot occur together, nor can many times <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> all at once. But in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, days and times are in the plural, for it is said, "His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" (<a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah 5:2</a>); and also it is said, "According to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the mystery hidden from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse25">Romans 16:25</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not omni-simultaneous.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the whole and the perfect are the same thing. Supposing, therefore, that it is "whole," it is superfluously described as "perfect."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, duration does not imply "possession." But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is a kind of duration. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not possession.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple things by way of compound things, so must we reach to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, which is nothing but the numbering of movement by "before" and "after." For since succession occurs in every movement, and one part comes after another, the fact that we reckon before and after in movement, makes us apprehend <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, which is nothing else but the measure of before and after in movement. Now in a thing bereft of movement, which is always the same, there is no before or after. As therefore the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> consists in the numbering of before and after in movement; so likewise in the apprehension of the uniformity of what is outside of movement, consists the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p>Further, those things are said to be measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> which have a beginning and an end in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, because in everything which is moved there is a beginning, and there is an end. But as whatever is wholly immutable can have no succession, so it has no beginning, and no end.

<p>Thus <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from two sources: first, because what is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is interminable--that is, has no beginning nor end (that is, no term either way); secondly, because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has no succession, being simultaneously whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Simple things are usually defined by way of negation; as "a point is that which has no parts." Yet this is not to be taken as if the negation belonged to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which first apprehends compound things, cannot attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple things except by removing the opposite.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, is not only being, but also living; and life extends to operation, which is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of being. Now the protraction of duration seems to belong to operation rather than to being; hence time is the numbering of movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> is called whole, not because it has parts, but because it is wanting in nothing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although incorporeal, is named in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> metaphorically by corporeal names, so <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> though simultaneously whole, is called by names implying <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and succession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Two things are to be considered in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> itself, which is successive; and the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, which is imperfect. Hence the expression "simultaneously-whole" is used to remove the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and the word "perfect" is used to exclude the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Whatever is possessed, is held firmly and quietly; therefore to designate the immutability and permanence of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, we use the word "possession."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God is eternal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For nothing made can be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. iv) that, "The now that flows away makes <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the now that stands still makes <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>;" and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 28) "that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is before <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, is not measured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Causis), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is before <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and He is after <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>": for it is written that "the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall reign for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and beyond [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'for ever and ever']" (<a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse18">Exodus 15:18</a>). Therefore to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is a kind of measure. But to be measured belongs not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it does not belong to Him to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, there is no present, past or future, since it is simultaneously whole; as was said in the preceding article. But words denoting present, past and future <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says in his <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Creed</a>: "The Father is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> follows immutability, as the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> follows movement, as appears from the preceding article. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely immutable, it supremely belongs to Him to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Nor is He <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> only; but He is His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; whereas, no other being is its own duration, as no other is its own being. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own uniform being; and hence as He is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so He is His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The "now" that stands still, is said to make <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> according to our apprehension. As the apprehension of time is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by the fact that we apprehend the flow of the "now," so the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by our apprehending the "now" standing still. When <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>," this is to be understood of participated <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> communicates His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to some in the same way as He communicates His immutability.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From this appears the answer to the Second Objection. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be before <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, according as it is shared by immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Hence, also, in the same book, it is said that "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> is equal to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>." In the words of Exodus, "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall reign for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and beyond," <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> stands for age, as another rendering has it. Thus it is said that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will reign beyond <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, inasmuch as He endures beyond every age, i.e. beyond every kind of duration. For age is nothing more than the period of each thing, as is said in the book De Coelo i. Or to reign beyond <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> can be taken to mean that if any other thing were conceived to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> for ever, as the movement of the heavens according to some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would still reign beyond, inasmuch as His reign is simultaneously whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> is nothing else but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, as if He were in any way measured; but the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of measurement is there taken according to the apprehension of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Words denoting different times are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> includes all times; not as if He Himself were altered through present, past and future.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether to be eternal belongs to God alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For it is written that "those who instruct many to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," shall be "as stars unto perpetual <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternities</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>']" (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse3">Daniel 12:3</a>). Now if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone were <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, there could not be many <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternities</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is not the only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written "Depart, ye cursed into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'everlasting'] fire" (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But there are many <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things; as, for instance, all principles of demonstration and all demonstrative propositions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Damasum. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the only one who has no beginning." Now whatever has a beginning, is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the only one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly so called is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> follows on immutability; as appears from the first article. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is altogether immutable, as was shown above (Question 9, Article 1). Accordingly, however, as some receive immutability from Him, they share in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Thus some receive immutability from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the way of never ceasing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>; in that sense it is said of the earth, "it standeth for ever" (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse4">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>). Again, some things are called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> because of the length of their duration, although they are in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corruptible; thus (<a href="../bible/psa075.htm#verse5">Psalm 75:5</a>) the hills are called "<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>" and we read "of the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> hills." (<a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>). Some again, share more fully than others in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, inasmuch as they possess unchangeableness either in being or further still in operation; like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the blessed, who enjoy the Word, because "as regards that vision of the Word, no changing thoughts <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the Saints," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv). Hence those who see God are said to have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; according to that text, "This is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are said to be many <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternities</a>, accordingly as many share in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, only because it never ends. Still, there is change in the pains of the lost, according to the words "To extreme heat they will pass from snowy waters" (<a href="../bible/job024.htm#verse19">Job 24:19</a>). Hence in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, but rather <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; according to the text of the Psalm "Their <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> will be for ever" (<a href="../bible/psa080.htm#verse16">Psalm 80:16</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">Necessary</a> means a certain mode of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. vi), is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore in this sense the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, because they are in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> mind, which is the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone; hence it does not follow that anything beside <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether eternity differs from time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> does not differ from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. For two measures of duration cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together, unless one is part of the other; for instance two days or two hours cannot be together; nevertheless, we may say that a day or an hour are together, considering hour as part of a day. But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time occur together, each of which imports a certain measure of duration. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not a part of time, forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> exceeds time, and includes it, it seems that time is a part of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and is not a different thing from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv), the "now" of time remains the same in the whole of time. But the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> seems to be that it is the same indivisible thing in the whole space of time. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is not substantially different from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not substantially different from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as the measure of the first movement is the measure of every movement, as said in Phys. iv, it thus appears that the measure of the first being is that of every being. But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the measure of the first being--that is, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">divine being</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the measure of every being. But the being of things corruptible is measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">Time</a> therefore is either <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> or is a part of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a> is simultaneously whole. But time has a "before" and an "after." Therefore time and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> are not the same thing.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is manifest that time and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> are not the same. Some have founded this difference on the fact that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has neither beginning nor an end; whereas time has a beginning and an end. This, however, makes a merely <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, and not an absolute difference because, granted that time always was and always will be, according to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of those who think the movement of the heavens goes on for ever, there would yet remain a difference between <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. v), arising from the fact that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is simultaneously whole; which cannot be applied to time: for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the measure of a permanent being; while time is a measure of movement. Supposing, however, that the aforesaid difference be considered on the part of the things measured, and not as regards the measures, then there is some reason for it, inasmuch as that alone is measured by time which has beginning and end in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence, if the movement of the heavens lasted always, time would not be of its measure as regards the whole of its duration, since the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not measurable; but it would be the measure of that part of its revolution which has beginning and end in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>Another reason for the same can be taken from these measures in themselves, if we consider the end and the beginning as potentialities; because, granted also that time always goes on, yet it is possible to note in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> both the beginning and the end, by considering its parts: thus we speak of the beginning and the end of a day or of a year; which cannot be applied to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Still these differences follow upon the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> and primary differences, that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is simultaneously whole, but that time is not so.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Such a reason would be a valid one if <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> were the same kind of measure; but this is seen not to be the case when we consider those things of which the respective measures are <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The "now" of time is the same as regards its subject in the whole course of time, but it differs in aspect; for inasmuch as time corresponds to movement, its "now" corresponds to what is movable; and the thing movable has the same one subject in all time, but differs in aspect a being here and there; and such alteration is movement. Likewise the flow of the "now" as alternating in aspect is time. But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> remains the same according to both subject and aspect; and hence <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not the same as the "now" of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the proper measure of permanent being, so time is the proper measure of movement; and hence, according as any being recedes from permanence of being, and is subject to change, it recedes from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and is subject to time. Therefore the being of things corruptible, because it is changeable, is not measured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but by time; for time measures not only things actually changed, but also things changeable; hence it not only measures movement but it also measures repose, which belongs to whatever is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> movable, but is not actually in motion.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. The difference of aeviternity and time</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that aeviternity is the same as time. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22,23), that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> through time." But aeviternity is said to be the measure of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore time is the same as aeviternity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to time to have "before" and "after"; but it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to be simultaneously whole, as was shown above in the first article. Now aeviternity is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse1">Sirach 1:1</a>) that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> "Wisdom is before age." Therefore it is not simultaneously whole but has "before" and "after"; and thus it is the same as time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if there is no "before" and "after" in aeviternity, it follows that in aeviternal things there is no difference between being, having been, or going to be. Since then it is impossible for aeviternal things not to have been, it follows that it is impossible for them not to be in the future; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can reduce them to nothing.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, since the duration of aeviternal things is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as to subsequent duration, if aeviternity is simultaneously whole, it follows that some creature is actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; which is impossible. Therefore aeviternity does not differ from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii) "Who commandest time to be separate from aeviternity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Aeviternity differs from time, and from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, as the mean between them both. This difference is explained by some to consist in the fact that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has neither beginning nor end, aeviternity, a beginning but no end, and time both beginning and end. This difference, however, is but an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> one, as was shown above, in the preceding article; because even if aeviternal things had always been, and would always be, as some think, and even if they might sometimes fail to be, which is possible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to allow; even granted this, aeviternity would still be distinguished from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>Others assign the difference between these three to consist in the fact that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has no "before" and "after"; but that time has both, together with innovation and veteration; and that aeviternity has "before" and "after" without innovation and veteration. This theory, however, involves a contradiction; which manifestly appears if innovation and veteration be referred to the measure itself. For since "before" and "after" of duration cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> together, if aeviternity has "before" and "after," it must follow that with the receding of the first part of aeviternity, the after part of aeviternity must newly appear; and thus innovation would occur in aeviternity itself, as it does in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. And if they be referred to the things measured, even then an incongruity would follow. For a thing which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> grows old with time, because it has a changeable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and from the changeableness of a thing measured, there follows "before" and "after" in the measure, as is clear from Phys. iv. Therefore the fact that an aeviternal thing is neither inveterate, nor subject to innovation, comes from its changelessness; and consequently its measure does not contain "before" and "after." We say then that since <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the measure of a permanent being, in so far as anything recedes from permanence of being, it recedes from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Now some things recede from permanence of being, so that their being is subject to change, or consists in change; and these things are measured by time, as are all movements, and also the being of all things corruptible. But others recede less from permanence of being, forasmuch as their being neither consists in change, nor is the subject of change; nevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. This appears in the heavenly bodies, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being of which is unchangeable; and yet with unchangeable being they have changeableness of place. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who have an unchangeable being as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with changeableness as regards choice; moreover they have changeableness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, of affections and of places in their own degree. Therefore these are measured by aeviternity which is a mean between <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time. But the being that is measured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is not changeable, nor is it annexed to change. In this way time has "before" and "after"; aeviternity in itself has no "before" and "after," which can, however, be annexed to it; while <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has neither "before" nor "after," nor is it compatible with such at all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Spiritual creatures as regards successive affections and intelligences are measured by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence also <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22,23) that to be moved through time, is to be moved by affections. But as regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they are measured by aeviternity; whereas as regards the vision of glory, they have a share of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Aeviternity is simultaneously whole; yet it is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, because "before" and "after" are compatible with it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the very being of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> considered absolutely, there is no difference of past and future, but only as regards <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> change. Now to say that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was, or is, or will be, is to be taken in a different sense according to the acceptation of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which apprehends the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by comparison with different parts of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But when we say that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is, or was, we suppose something, which being supposed, its opposite is not subject to the divine power. Whereas when we say he will be, we do not as yet suppose anything. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and non-existence of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> considered absolutely is subject to the divine power, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> not future; but He cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him not to be while he is, or not to have been, after he has been.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The duration of aeviternity is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, forasmuch as it is not finished by <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence, there is no incongruity in saying that a creature is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, inasmuch as it is not ended by any other creature.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there is only one aeviternity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is not only one aeviternity; for it is written in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books of Esdras: "Majesty and power of ages are with Thee, O Lord."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, different genera have different measures. But some aeviternal things belong to the corporeal genus, as the heavenly bodies; and others are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since aeviternity is a term of duration, where there is one aeviternity, there is also one duration. But not all aeviternal things have one duration, for some begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> after others; as appears in the case especially of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, things not dependent on each other do not seem to have one measure of duration; for there appears to be one time for all temporal things; since the first movement, measured by time, is in some way the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all movement. But aeviternal things do not depend on each other, for one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Aeviternity is a more simple thing than time, and is nearer to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But time is one only. Therefore much more is aeviternity one only.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A twofold opinion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on this subject. Some say there is only one aeviternity; others that there are many aeviternities. Which of these is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, may be considered from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why time is one; for we can rise from corporeal things to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p>Now some say that there is only one time for temporal things, forasmuch as one number <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> for all things numbered; as time is a number, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. iv). This, however, is not a sufficient reason; because time is not a number abstracted from the thing numbered, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the thing numbered; otherwise it would not be continuous; for ten ells of cloth are continuous not by reason of the number, but by reason of the thing numbered. Now number as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the thing numbered, is not the same for all; but it is different for different things. Hence, others assert that the unity of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> as the principle of all duration is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the unity of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Thus all durations are one in that view, in the light of their principle, but are many in the light of the diversity of things receiving duration from the influx of the first principle. On the other hand others assign primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why time is one; as it is the first subject of movement, the measure of which is time. Neither of these reasons, however, is sufficient; forasmuch as things which are one in principle, or in subject, especially if distant, are not one absolutely, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason why time is one, is to be found in the oneness of the first movement by which, since it is most simple, all other movements are measured. Therefore time is referred to that movement, not only as a measure is to the thing measured, but also as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is to subject; and thus receives unity from it. Whereas to other movements it is compared only as the measure is to the thing measured. Hence it is not multiplied by their multitude, because by one separate measure many things can be measured.

<p>This being established, we must observe that a twofold opinion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Some said that all proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a certain equality, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> said (Peri Archon. i); or at least many of them, as some others thought. Others said that all <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a certain degree and order; and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. x) seems to have thought so, when he said that among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> there are the first, the middle and the last; even in one order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now according to the first opinion, it must be said that there are many aeviternities as there are many aeviternal things of first degree. But according to the second opinion, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to say that there is one aeviternity only; because since each thing is measured by the most simple element of its genus, it must be that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of all aeviternal things should be measured by the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the first aeviternal thing, which is all the more simple the nearer it is to the first. Wherefore because the second opinion is truer, as will be shown later (47, 2); we concede at present that there is only one aeviternity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Aeviternity is sometimes taken for age, that is, a space of a thing's duration; and thus we say many <em>aeviternities</em> when we mean <em>ages</em>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the heavenly bodies and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things differ in the genus of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, still they agree in having a changeless being, and are thus measured by aeviternity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All temporal things did not begin together; nevertheless there is one time for all of them, by reason of the first measured by time; and thus all aeviternal things have one aeviternity by reason of the first, though all did not begin together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> For things to be measured by one, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the one should be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all, but that it be more simple than the rest.
