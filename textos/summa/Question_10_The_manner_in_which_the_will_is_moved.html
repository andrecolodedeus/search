<h1>Question 10. The manner in which the will is moved</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2010.htm#article1"> Is the will moved to anything naturally?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2010.htm#article2"> Is it moved of necessity by its object?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2010.htm#article3"> Is it moved of necessity by the lower appetite?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2010.htm#article4"> Is it moved of necessity by the exterior mover which is God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the will is moved to anything naturally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved to anything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent is condivided with the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agent, as stated at the beginning of Phys. ii, 1. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved to anything <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is in a thing always: as "being hot" is in fire. But no movement is always in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore no movement is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is determinate to one thing: whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is referred to opposites. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills nothing <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows the movement of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands some things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, too, wills some things <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duabus Nat.) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> also (Metaph. v, 4) the word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" is used in a manifold sense. For sometimes it stands for the intrinsic principle in movable things. In this sense <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is either <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or the material form, as stated in Phys. ii, 1. In another sense <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stands for any <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, or even for any being. And in this sense, that is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a thing which befits it in respect of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. And this is that which of itself is in a thing. Now all things that do not of themselves belong to the thing in which they are, are reduced to something which belongs of itself to that thing, as to their principle. Wherefore, taking <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in this sense, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the principle of whatever belongs to a thing, be a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principle. This is evident in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: for the principles of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In like manner the principle of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> movements must be something <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> willed.

<p>Now this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general, to which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as does each power to its object; and again it is the last end, which stands in the same relation to things appetible, as the first principles of demonstrations to things intelligible: and, speaking generally, it is all those things which belong to the willer according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For it is not only things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> desires, but also that which pertains to each power, and to the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wills <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> not only the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but also other things that are appropriate to the other powers; such as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which befits the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and to be and to live and other like things which regard the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> well-being; all of which are included in the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as so many particular goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as one kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from another; for some things happen <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and some are done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. There is, however, another manner of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> that is proper to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is mistress of its act, besides the manner proper to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is determinate to one thing. But since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is founded on some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the movement proper to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be shared by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to some extent: just as what belongs to a previous <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is shared by a subsequent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Because in every thing, being itself, which is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, precedes volition, which is from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills something <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the case of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as a result of the form only, is always in them actually, as heat is in fire. But that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> as a result of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is not always in them actually, but sometimes only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>: because form is act, whereas <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Now movement is "the act of that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>" (Aristotle, Phys. iii, 1). Wherefore that which belongs to, or results from, movement, in regard to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, is not always in them. Thus fire does not always move upwards, but only when it is outside its own place. [The Aristotelian theory was that fire's proper place is the fiery <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, i.e. the Empyrean.] And in like manner it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> (which is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, when it wills something), should always be in the act of volition; but only when it is in a certain determinate disposition. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, which is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, is always in the act of volition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To every <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is one thing corresponding, proportionate, however, to that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> considered as a genus, there corresponds something one generically; and to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> there corresponds something one specifically; and to the individualized <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there corresponds some one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is an immaterial power like the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, some one general thing corresponds to it, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; just as to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there corresponds some one general thing, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or being, or "what a thing is." And under <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in general are included many particular goods, to none of which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> determined.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the will is moved, of necessity, by its object?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, by its object. For the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as mover to movable, as stated in De Anima iii, 10. But a mover, if it be sufficient, moves the movable of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by its object.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is an immaterial power, so is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: and both powers are ordained to a universal object, as stated above (01, ad 3). But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, by its object: therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> also, by its object.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever one wills, is either the end, or something ordained to an end. But, seemingly, one wills an end <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>: because it is like the principle in speculative matters, to which principle one assents of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Now the end is the reason for willing the means; and so it seems that we will the means also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by its object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The rational powers, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ix, 2) are directed to opposites. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a rational power, since it is in the reason, as stated in De Anima iii, 9. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is directed to opposites. Therefore it is not moved, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, to either of the opposites.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved in two ways: first, as to the exercise of its act; secondly, as to the specification of its act, derived from the object. As to the first way, no object moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, for no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what the object be, it is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power not to think of it, and consequently not to will it actually. But as to the second manner of motion, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by one object <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, by another not. For in the movement of a power by its object, we must consider under what aspect the object moves the power. For the visible moves the sight, under the aspect of color actually visible. Wherefore if color be offered to the sight, it moves the sight <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>: unless one turns one's eyes away; which belongs to the exercise of the act. But if the sight were confronted with something not in all respects colored actually, but only so in some respects, and in other respects not, the sight would not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> see such an object: for it might look at that part of the object which is not actually colored, and thus it would not see it. Now just as the actually colored is the object of sight, so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be offered an object which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> universally and from every point of view, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tends to it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, if it wills anything at all; since it cannot will the opposite. If, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is offered an object that is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from every point of view, it will not tend to it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. And since lack of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whatever, is a non-<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, consequently, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone which is perfect and lacking in nothing, is such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot not-will it: and this is Happiness. Whereas any other particular goods, in so far as they are lacking in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, can be regarded as non-goods: and from this point of view, they can be set aside or approved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which can tend to one and the same thing from various points of view.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sufficient mover of a power is none but that object that in every respect presents the aspect of the mover of that power. If, on the other hand, it is lacking in any respect, it will not move of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is moved, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, by an object which is such as to be always and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: but not by that which may be either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>--viz. by that which is <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>: as we have said of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The last end moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, because it is the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. In like manner whatever is ordained to that end, and without which the end cannot be attained, such as "to be" and "to live," and the like. But other things without which the end can be gained, are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> willed by one who wills the end: just as he who assents to the principle, does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> assent to the conclusions, without which the principles can still be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the will is moved, of necessity, by the lower appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse19">Romans 7:19</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which I will I do not; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I will not, that I do": and this is said by reason of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated in Ethic. iii, 5, "according as a man is, such does the end seem to him." But it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to cast aside a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> once. Therefore it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power not to will that to which the passion inclines him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not applied to a particular effect, except by means of a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: wherefore the universal reason does not move save by means of a particular estimation, as stated in De Anima iii, 11. But as the universal reason is to the particular estimation, so is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not moved to will something particular, except through the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore, if the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> happen to be disposed to something, by reason of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot be moved in a contrary sense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse7">Genesis 4:7</a>): "Thy <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> [Vulg. 'The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof'] shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 9, Article 2), the passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by its object: inasmuch as, to wit, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through being disposed in such and such a way by a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, judges something to be fitting and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which he would not judge thus were it not for the passion. Now this influence of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> occurs in two ways. First, so that his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is wholly bound, so that he has not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: as happens in those who through a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> access of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> become furious or insane, just as they may from some other bodily disorder; since such like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> do not take place without some change in the body. And of such the same is to be said as of irrational animals, which follow, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the impulse of their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: for in them there is neither movement of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, nor, consequently, of will.

<p>Sometimes, however, the reason is not entirely engrossed by the passion, so that the judgment of reason retains, to a certain extent, its freedom: and thus the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> remains in a certain degree. Accordingly in so far as the reason remains free, and not subject to the passion, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> movement, which also remains, does not tend of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to that whereto the passion inclines it. Consequently, either there is no movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the passion alone holds its sway: or if there be a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follow the passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot prevent the movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> from arising, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I will not, that I do--i.e. I desire"; yet it is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> not to will to desire or not to consent to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. And thus it does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follow the movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and sensitive; sometimes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is such and such uniformly in respect of his whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: either because the sensitive part is wholly subject to this reason, as in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; or because reason is entirely engrossed by passion, as in a madman. But sometimes, although reason is clouded by passion, yet something of this reason remains free. And in respect of this, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can either repel the passion entirely, or at least hold himself in check so as not to be led away by the passion. For when thus disposed, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is variously disposed according to the various parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a thing appears to him otherwise according to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, than it does according to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved not only by the universal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by the reason, but also by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by sense. Wherefore he can be moved to some particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> independently of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. For we will and do many things without passion, and through choice alone; as is most evident in those cases wherein reason resists passion.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the will is moved of necessity by the exterior mover which is God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For every agent that cannot be resisted moves of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be resisted, because His power is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse19">Romans 9:19</a>): "Who resisteth His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to whatever it wills <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, as stated above (02, ad 3). But "whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does in a thing is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> everything to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing is possible, if nothing impossible follows from its being supposed. But something impossible follows from the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> does not will that to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves it: because in that case <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> operation would be ineffectual. Therefore it is not possible for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> not to will that to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves it. Therefore it wills it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel." Therefore He does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> move <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, not to destroy but to preserve the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things." Wherefore it moves all things in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>; so that from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> through the Divine motion, effects follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; but from contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, effects follow contingently. Since, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is an active principle, not determinate to one thing, but having an indifferent relation to many things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so moves it, that He does not determine it of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to one thing, but its movement remains contingent and not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, except in those things to which it is moved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine will extends not only to the doing of something by the thing which He moves, but also to its being done in a way which is fitting to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that thing. And therefore it would be more repugnant to the Divine motion, for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be moved of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, which is not fitting to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; than for it to be moved freely, which is becoming to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a thing, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so works in it that it may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to it: for thus is something becoming to a thing, according as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes it to be becoming. Now He does not wish that whatever He works in things should be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to them, for instance, that the dead should rise again. But this He does wish to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to each thing--that it be subject to the Divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to anything, it is incompatible with this supposition, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be not moved thereto. But it is not impossible simply. Consequently it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>.
