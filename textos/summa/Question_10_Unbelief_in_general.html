<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether unbelief is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unbelief is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> proves (De Fide Orth. ii, 4). Now unbelief seems not to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that "to be capable to having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, just as to be capable of having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; whereas to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the faithful." Therefore not to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is to be an unbeliever, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that which he cannot avoid, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now it is not in a man's power to avoid unbelief, for he cannot avoid it unless he have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse14">Romans 10:14</a>): "How shall they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, of Whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?" Therefore unbelief does not seem to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated above (I-II, 84, 4), there are seven capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to which all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are reduced. But unbelief does not seem to be comprised under any of them. Therefore unbelief is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Vice is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and unbelief is opposed to it. Therefore unbelief is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Unbelief may be taken in two ways: first, by way of pure negation, so that a man be called an unbeliever, merely because he has not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Secondly, unbelief may be taken by way of opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; in which sense a man refuses to hear the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or despises it, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah 53:1</a>: "Who hath <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report?" It is this that completes the notion of unbelief, and it is in this sense that unbelief is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>If, however, we take it by way of pure negation, as we find it in those who have heard nothing about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it bears the character, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of punishment, because such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of Divine things is a result of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>. If such like unbelievers are damned, it is on account of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which cannot be taken away without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a>) "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.) as "referring to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To have the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but it is part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind should not thwart his inner <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, and the outward preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence, in this way, unbelief is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument takes unbelief as denoting a pure negation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Unbelief, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, through which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unwilling to subject his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to the sound interpretation of the Fathers. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "presumptuous innovations arise from vainglory."

<p>It might also be replied that just as the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not reduced to the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but precede them, so too, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not reduced to the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether unbelief is in the intellect as its subject?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unbelief is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as its subject. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Duabus Anim. x, xi). Now unbelief is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore unbelief resides in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, unbelief is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> through contempt of the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But contempt pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore unbelief is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Enchiridion lx.] on <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 11:14</a> "Satan . . . transformeth himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light," says that if "a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> pretend to be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and be taken for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, it is not a dangerous or an unhealthy <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, if he does or says what is becoming to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>." This seems to be because of the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who adheres to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, since his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is to adhere to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief seems to consist entirely in a perverse will: and, consequently, it does not reside in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Things which are contrary to one another are in the same subject. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which unbelief is opposed, resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore unbelief also is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 74, 1,2), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be in the power which is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act. Now a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act may have two principles: one is its first and universal principle, which commands all acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. The other principle of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act is the proper and proximate principle which elicits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act: thus the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, wherefore these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are said to be in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Now dissent, which is the act proper to unbelief, is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, moved, however, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, just as assent is.

<p>Therefore unbelief, like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as its proximate subject. But it is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as its first moving principle, in which way every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will's contempt <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> dissent, which completes the notion of unbelief. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unbelief is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, while unbelief itself is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one, does not dissent from a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because "his bodily senses are deceived, while his mind does not depart from a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right judgment" as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Enchiridion lx]. But, according to the same authority, to adhere to Satan when he begins to invite one to his abode, i.e. <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether unbelief is the greatest of sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unbelief is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bapt. contra Donat. iv, 20): "I should hesitate to decide whether a very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ought to be preferred to a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, in whose life one finds nothing reprehensible beyond the fact that he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>." But a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is an unbeliever. Therefore we ought not to say absolutely that unbelief is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which diminishes or excuses a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not, seemingly, the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now unbelief excuses or diminishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 1:12-13</a>): "I . . . before was a blasphemer, and a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a> and contumelious; but I obtained . . . mercy . . . because I did it ignorantly in unbelief." Therefore unbelief is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deserves the greater punishment, according to <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>: "According to the measure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall the measure also of the stripes be." Now a greater punishment is due to believers than to unbelievers, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews 10:29</a>: "How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, by which he was sanctified?" Therefore unbelief is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a>, "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," says (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.): "Under the general name, He refers to a singularly great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For this," viz. infidelity, "is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to which all others may be traced." Therefore unbelief is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists formally in aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (I-II, 71, 6; I-II, 73, 3). Hence the more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> severs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the graver it is. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more than ever separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by unbelief, because he has not even <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not approach Him, but is severed from Him.

<p>Nor is it possible for one who has a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in any way at all, because the object of his opinion is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief is greater than any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that occurs in the perversion of morals. This does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are opposed to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as we shall stated further on (20, 3; 34, 2, ad 2; 39, 2, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is more grave in its genus from being less grave in respect of some circumstances. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> hesitated to decide between a bad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> otherwise, because although the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grave generically, it can be lessened by a circumstance, and conversely the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> can, by some circumstance, be aggravated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Unbelief includes both <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as an accessory thereto, and resistance to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in the latter respect it is a most grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On respect, however, of this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, it has a certain reason for excuse, especially when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, as was the case with the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An unbeliever is more severely punished for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief than another sinner is for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, if we consider the kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But in the case of another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, committed by a believer, and by an unbeliever, the believer, other things being equal, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the unbeliever, both on account of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and on account of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with which he has been satiated, and which he insults by committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether every act of an unbeliever is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that each act of an unbeliever is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans 14:23</a>, "All that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," says: "The whole life of unbelievers is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now the life of unbelievers consists of their actions. Therefore every action of an unbeliever is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> directs the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now there can be no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save what comes from a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Therefore, among unbelievers, no action can be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when that which precedes is corrupted, that which follows is corrupted also. Now an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore, since there is no act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in unbelievers, they can do no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in every action of theirs.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of Cornelius, while yet an unbeliever (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse4">Acts 10:4-31</a>), that his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore not every action of an unbeliever is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but some of his actions are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 85, 2,4) mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes away <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, but does not wholly corrupt the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Since therefore, unbelief is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unbelievers are without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> indeed, yet some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> remains in them. Consequently it is evident that unbelievers cannot do those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works which proceed from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works; yet they can, to a certain extent, do those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works for which the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> suffices.

<p>Hence it does not follow that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in everything they do; but whenever they do anything out of their unbelief, then they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For even as one who has the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, can commit an actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, venial or even mortal, which he does not refer to the end of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so too, an unbeliever can do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which he does not refer to the end of his unbelief.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted must be taken to mean either that the life of unbelievers cannot be sinless, since without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away, or that whatever they do out of unbelief, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence the same authority adds: "Because every one that lives or acts according to his unbelief, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> grievously."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> directs the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> last end: but even the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can direct the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in respect of a connatural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Unbelief does not so wholly destroy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in unbelievers, but that some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains in them, whereby they are able to do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that are generically <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. With regard, however, to Cornelius, it is to be observed that he was not an unbeliever, else his works would not have been acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom none can please without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now he had implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel was not yet made manifest: hence <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was sent to him to give him fuller instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there are several species of unbelief?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief. For, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and unbelief are contrary to one another, they must be about the same thing. Now the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the First Truth, whence it derives its unity, although its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> contains many points of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Therefore the object of unbelief also is the First Truth; while the things which an unbeliever disbelieves are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of his unbelief. Now the specific difference depends not on material but on formal principles. Therefore there are not several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, according to the various points which the unbeliever disbelieves.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is possible to stray from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ways. If therefore the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief correspond to the number of various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, it would seem to follow that there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, and consequently, that we ought not to make these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> the object of our consideration.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing does not belong to different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now a man may be an unbeliever through erring about different points of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore diversity of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> does not make a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief: and so there are not several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are opposed to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> happens in one way, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in many ways," according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6). Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are opposed to it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 55, 4; I-II, 64, 1), every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in following some rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or operation. Now conformity to a rule happens one way in one <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas a breach of the rule happens in many ways, so that many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The diversity of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that are opposed to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be considered in two ways, first, with regard to their different relations to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in this way there are determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> contrary to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus to a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed by exceeding the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and another, by falling short of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, the diversity of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be considered in respect of the corruption of the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> required for that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of ways in which the various circumstances of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be corrupted, so that the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is forsaken. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a> held <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p>Accordingly we must say that if unbelief be considered in comparison to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there are several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, determinate in number. For, since the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief consists in resisting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, this may happen in two ways: either the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is resisted before it has been accepted, and such is the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; or the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is resisted after it has been accepted, and this either in the figure, and such is the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, or in the very manifestation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and such is the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Hence we may, in a general way, reckon these three as <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief.

<p>If, however, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief be distinguished according to the various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that occur in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there are not determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief: for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> can be multiplied indefinitely, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Haeresibus).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The formal aspect of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be considered in two ways. First, according to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the sinner, in which case the thing to which the sinner turns is the formal object of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and determines the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, it may be considered as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and in this case the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is forsaken is the formal object of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which however does not derive its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from this point of view, in fact it is a privation. We must therefore reply that the object of unbelief is the First Truth considered as that which unbelief forsakes, but its formal aspect, considered as that to which unbelief turns, is the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion that it follows: and it is from this point of view that unbelief derives its various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence, even as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is one, because it adheres to the Sovereign Good, while there are various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which turn away from the Sovereign Good by turning to various temporal goods, and also in respect of various inordinate relations to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so too, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through adhering to the one First Truth, yet there are many <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, because unbelievers follow many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief according to various points in which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> occur.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one because it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in many things in relation to one, so may unbelief, although it <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in many things, be one in so far as all those things are related to one. Yet nothing hinders one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from erring in various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, even as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be subject to various <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and to various bodily diseases.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the unbelief of pagans or heathens is graver than other kinds?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> is graver than other kinds. For just as bodily disease is graver according as it endangers the health of a more important member of the body, so does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> appear to be graver, according as it is opposed to that which holds a more important place in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now that which is most important in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> deviate by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in many gods. Therefore their unbelief is the gravest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, the more detestable are those which contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in more numerous and more important points: thus, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who severed the Godhead, was more detestable than that of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> who severed the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in more numerous and more important points than <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; since they do not accept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all. Therefore their unbelief is the gravest.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> diminishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now there is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, since they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since they venerate the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Therefore they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> less grievously than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, who receive neither Testament.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse21">2 Peter 2:21</a>): "It had been better for them not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, than after they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, to turn back." Now the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> have abandoned it after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it in some way. Therefore theirs is the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>), two things may be considered in unbelief. One of these is its relation to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and from this point of view, he who resists the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> after accepting it, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, than he who resists it without having accepted it, even as he who fails to fulfil what he has promised, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than if he had never promised it. On this way the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who confess their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Gospel, and resist that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by corrupting it, is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, who have never accepted the Gospel <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Since, however, they accepted the figure of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which they corrupt by their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretations, their unbelief is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, because the latter have not accepted the Gospel <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in any way at all.

<p>The second thing to be considered in unbelief is the corruption of matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On this respect, since <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> on more points than <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and these in more points than <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> is more grievous than the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and that of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> than that of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, except in such cases as that of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>, who, in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> even more than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> do.

<p>Of these two gravities the first surpasses the second from the point of view of guilt; since, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) unbelief has the character of guilt, from its resisting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rather than from the mere absence of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for the latter as was stated (1) seems rather to bear the character of punishment. Hence, speaking absolutely, the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is the worst.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether one ought to dispute with unbelievers in public?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not to dispute with unbelievers in public. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse14">2 Timothy 2:14</a>): "Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers." But it is impossible to dispute with unbelievers publicly without contending in words. Therefore one ought not to dispute publicly with unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Martianus Augustus confirmed by the canons [De Sum. Trin. Cod. lib. i, leg. Nemo] expresses itself thus: "It is an insult to the judgment of the most religious synod, if anyone ventures to debate or dispute in public about matters which have once been judged and disposed of." Now all matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have been decided by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> councils. Therefore it is an insult to the councils, and consequently a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to presume to dispute in public about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, disputations are conducted by means of arguments. But an argument is a reason in settlement of a dubious <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: whereas things that are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being most certain, ought not to be a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Therefore one ought not to dispute in public about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse22">Acts 9:22-29</a>) that "Saul increased much more in strength, and confounded the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>," and that "he spoke . . . to the gentiles and disputed with the Greeks."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In disputing about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, two things must be observed: one on the part of the disputant; the other on the part of his hearers. On the part of the disputant, we must consider his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. For if he were to dispute as though he had <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and did not hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for certain, and as though he intended to probe it with arguments, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and an unbeliever. On the other hand, it is praiseworthy to dispute about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in order to confute <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, or for practice.

<p>On the part of the hearers we must consider whether those who hear the disputation are instructed and firm in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or simple and wavering. As to those who are well instructed and firm in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there can be no danger in disputing about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in their presence. But as to simple-minded people, we must make a distinction; because either they are provoked and molested by unbelievers, for instance, <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> who strive to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in them, or else they are not subject to provocation in this matter, as in those countries where there are not unbelievers. On the first case it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to dispute in public about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, provided there be those who are equal and adapted to the task of confuting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; since in this way simple people are strengthened in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and unbelievers are deprived of the opportunity to deceive, while if those who ought to withstand the perverters of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were silent, this would tend to strengthen <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. ii, 4): "Even as a thoughtless speech gives rise to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so does an indiscreet silence leave those in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who might have been instructed." On the other hand, in the second case it is dangerous to dispute in public about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the presence of simple people, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for this very reason is more firm, that they have never heard anything differing from what they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Hence it is not expedient for them to hear what unbelievers have to say against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> does not entirely forbid disputations, but such as are inordinate, and consist of contentious words rather than of sound speeches.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbade those public disputations about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which arise from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not those which are for the safeguarding thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One ought to dispute about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not as though one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> about them, but in order to make the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and to confute <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For, in order to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sometimes to dispute with unbelievers, sometimes by defending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse15">1 Peter 3:15</a>: "Being ready always to satisfy everyone that asketh you a reason of that hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in you [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Of that hope which is in you' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' reading is apparently taken from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>]." Sometimes again, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in order to convince those who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, according to <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus 1:9</a>: "That he may be able to exhort in <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">sound doctrine</a> and to convince the gainsayers."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether unbelievers ought to be compelled to the faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unbelievers ought by no means to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse28">Matthew 13:28</a>) that the servants of the householder, in whose field cockle had been sown, asked him: "Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?" and that he answered: "No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it": on which passage <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xlvi in Matth.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says this so as to forbid the slaying of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For it is not right to slay <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because if you do you will <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> slay many innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Therefore it seems that for the same reason unbelievers ought not to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we read in the Decretals (Dist. xlv can., De Judaeis): "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod prescribes, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, that for the future, none are to be compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." Therefore, in like manner, neither should unbelievers be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.) that "it is possible for a man to do other things against his will, but he cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unless he is willing." Therefore it seems that unbelievers ought not to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> It is said in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 18:32</a> [<a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>]): "I desire not the death of the sinner [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'of him that dieth']." Now we ought to conform our will to the Divine will, as stated above (I-II, 19, A9,10). Therefore we should not even wish unbelievers to be put to death.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse23">Luke 14:23</a>): "Go out into the highways and hedges; and compel them to come in." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> enter into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. into Holy Church, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore some ought to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Among unbelievers there are some who have never received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: and these are by no means to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: nevertheless they should be compelled by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, if it be possible to do so, so that they do not hinder the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by their blasphemies, or by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> persuasions, or even by their open <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. It is for this reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> faithful often wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with unbelievers, not indeed for the purpose of forcing them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because even if they were to conquer them, and take them prisoners, they should still leave them free to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, if they will, but in order to prevent them from hindering the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>On the other hand, there are unbelievers who at some time have accepted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and professed it, such as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and all apostates: such should be submitted even to bodily compulsion, that they may fulfil what they have promised, and hold what they, at one time, received.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some have understood the authority quoted to forbid, not the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> but the slaying of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as appears from the words of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> too, says (Ep. ad Vincent. xciii) of himself: "It was once my opinion that none should be compelled to union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we should deal in words, and fight with arguments. However this opinion of mine is undone, not by words of contradiction, but by convincing examples. Because fear of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was so profitable, that many say: Thanks be to the Lord Who has broken our chains asunder." Accordingly the meaning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> words, "Suffer both to grow until the harvest," must be gathered from those which precede, "lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root the wheat also together with it." For, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Ep. Parmen. iii, 2) "these words show that when this is not to be feared, that is to say, when a man's crime is so publicly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and so hateful to all, that he has no defenders, or none such as might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the severity of discipline should not slacken."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> who have in no way received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ought not by no means to be compelled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: if, however, they have received it, they ought to be compelled to keep it, as is stated in the same chapter.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as taking a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is a matter of will, and keeping a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, a matter of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, so acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a matter of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereas keeping the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when once one has received it, is a matter of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be compelled to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says to the Count Boniface (Ep. clxxxv): "What do these people mean by crying out continually: 'We may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> just as we choose. Whom did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> compel?' They should remember that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> at first compelled <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and afterwards taught Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same letter, "none of us wishes any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to perish. But the house of David did not deserve to have peace, unless his son Absalom had been killed in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which he had raised against his father. Thus if the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church gathers together some of the perdition of others, she heals the sorrow of her maternal heart by the delivery of so many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether it is lawful to communicate with unbelievers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is lawful to communicate with unbelievers. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>): "If any of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, invite you, and you be willing to go, eat of anything that is set before you." And <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xxv super Epist. ad Heb.): "If you wish to go to dine with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, we permit it without any reservation." Now to sit at table with anyone is to communicate with him. Therefore it is lawful to communicate with unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>): "What have I to do to judge them that are without?" Now unbelievers are without. When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbids the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to communicate with certain people, it seems that they ought not to be forbidden to communicate with unbelievers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a master cannot employ his servant, unless he communicate with him, at least by word, since the master moves his servant by command. Now <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> can have unbelievers, either <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, or Saracens, for servants. Therefore they can lawfully communicate with them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 7:2-3</a>): "Thou shalt make no league with them, nor show mercy to them; neither shalt thou make marriages with them": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse19">Leviticus 15:19</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who at the return of the month," etc. says: "It is so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to shun <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, that we should not come in touch with idolaters or their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nor have any dealings with them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Communication with a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, in two ways: first, as a punishment of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom they are forbidden to communicate; secondly, for the safety of those who are forbidden to communicate with others. Both motives can be gathered from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). For after he had pronounced sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, he adds as his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump?" and afterwards he adds the reason on the part of the punishment inflicted by the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when he says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>): "Do not you judge them that are within?"

<p>Accordingly, in the first way the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not forbid the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to communicate with unbelievers, who have not in any way received the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, viz. with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, because she has not the right to exercise <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> judgment over them, but only temporal judgment, in the case when, while dwelling among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> they are guilty of some misdemeanor, and are condemned by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to some temporal punishment. On the other hand, in this way, i.e. as a punishment, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbids the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to communicate with those unbelievers who have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they once received, either by corrupting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or by entirely renouncing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as apostates, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> pronounces sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on both.

<p>With regard to the second way, it seems that one ought to distinguish according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, circumstances and time. For some are firm in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and so it is to be hoped that their communicating with unbelievers will lead to the conversion of the latter rather than to the aversion of the faithful from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. These are not to be forbidden to communicate with unbelievers who have not received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> or <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, especially if there be some urgent <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for so doing. But in the case of simple people and those who are weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whose perversion is to be feared as a probable result, they should be forbidden to communicate with unbelievers, and especially to be on very familiar terms with them, or to communicate with them without <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Church does not exercise judgment against unbelievers in the point of inflicting <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> punishment on them: but she does exercise judgment over some of them in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of temporal punishment. It is under this head that sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for certain special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, withdraws the faithful from communication with certain unbelievers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is more probability that a servant who is ruled by his master's commands, will be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his master who is a believer, than if the case were the reverse: and so the faithful are not forbidden to have unbelieving servants. If, however, the master were in danger, through communicating with such a servant, he should send him away, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> command (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse8">Matthew 18:8</a>): "If . . . thy foot <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee."

<p>With regard to the argument in the contrary [The Leonine Edition gives this solution before the Reply to Objection 2 sense the reply is that the Lord gave this command in reference to those nations into whose territory the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> were about to enter. For the latter were inclined to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, so that it was to be feared lest, through frequent dealings with those <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, they should be estranged from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: hence the text goes on (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>): "For she will turn away thy son from following Me."

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether unbelievers may have authority or dominion over the faithful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that unbelievers may have authority or dominion over the faithful. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 6:1</a>): "Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>": and it is clear that he is speaking of unbelievers, since he adds (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 6:2</a>): "But they that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> masters, let them not despise them." Moreover it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse18">1 Peter 2:18</a>): "Servants be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and gentle, but also to the froward." Now this command would not be contained in the apostolic teaching unless unbelievers could have authority over the faithful. Therefore it seems that unbelievers can have authority over the faithful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the members of a prince's household are his subjects. Now some of the faithful were members of unbelieving princes' households, for we read in the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse22">4:22</a>): "All the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household," referring to Nero, who was an unbeliever. Therefore unbelievers can have authority over the faithful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 2) a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is his master's instrument in matters concerning everyday life, even as a craftsman's laborer is his instrument in matters concerning the working of his art. Now, in such matters, a believer can be subject to an unbeliever, for he may work on an unbeliever's farm. Therefore unbelievers may have authority over the faithful even as to dominion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those who are in authority can pronounce judgment on those over whom they are placed. But unbelievers cannot pronounce judgment on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>): "Dare any of you, having a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> against another, go to be judged before the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>," i.e. unbelievers, "and not before the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>?" Therefore it seems that unbelievers cannot have authority over the faithful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> That this question may be considered in two ways. First, we may speak of dominion or authority of unbelievers over the faithful as of a thing to be established for the first time. This ought by no means to be allowed, since it would provoke <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and endanger the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for subjects are easily influenced by their superiors to comply with their commands, unless the subjects are of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: moreover unbelievers hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in contempt, if they see the faithful fall away. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> forbade the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> before an unbelieving judge. And so the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> altogether forbids unbelievers to acquire dominion over believers, or to have authority over them in any capacity whatever.

<p>Secondly, we may speak of dominion or authority, as already in force: and here we must observe that dominion and authority are institutions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, while the distinction between faithful and unbelievers arises from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, does not do away with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore the distinction between faithful and unbelievers, considered in itself, does not do away with dominion and authority of unbelievers over the faithful.

<p>Nevertheless this right of dominion or authority can be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> done away with by the sentence or ordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who has the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since unbelievers in virtue of their unbelief deserve to forfeit their power over the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are converted into children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>This the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does sometimes, and sometimes not. For among those unbelievers who are subject, even in temporal matters, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her members, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that if the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of a <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he should forthwith receive his freedom, without paying any price, if he should be a "vernaculus," i.e. born in slavery; and likewise if, when yet an unbeliever, he had been bought for his service: if, however, he had been bought for sale, then he should be offered for sale within three months. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> harm them in this, because since those <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> themselves are subject to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, she can dispose of their possessions, even as secular princes have enacted many laws to be observed by their subjects, in favor of liberty. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not applied the above <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to those unbelievers who are not subject to her or her members, in temporal matters, although she has the right to do so: and this, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, for as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> showed (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse25">Matthew 17:25-26</a>) that He could be excused from paying the tribute, because "the children are free," yet He ordered the tribute to be paid in order to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too, after saying that servants should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their masters, adds, "lest the name of the Lord and His doctrine be blasphemed."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The authority of Caesar preceded the distinction of faithful from unbelievers. Hence it was not cancelled by the conversion of some to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover it was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing that there should be a few of the faithful in the emperor's household, that they might defend the rest of the faithful. Thus the Blessed Sebastian encouraged those whom he saw faltering under torture, and, the while, remained hidden under the military cloak in the palace of Diocletian.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Slaves are subject to their masters for their whole lifetime, and are subject to their overseers in everything: whereas the craftsman's laborer is subject to him for certain special works. Hence it would be more dangerous for unbelievers to have dominion or authority over the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, than that they should be allowed to employ them in some craft. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> permits <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to work on the land of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, because this does not entail their living together with them. Thus Solomon besought the King of Tyre to send master workmen to hew the trees, as related in <a href="../bible/1ki005.htm#verse6">1 Kings 5:6</a>. Yet, if there be reason to fear that the faithful will be perverted by such communications and dealings, they should be absolutely forbidden.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the rites of unbelievers ought to be tolerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that rites of unbelievers ought not to be tolerated. For it is evident that unbelievers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in observing their rites: and not to prevent a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when one can, seems to imply consent therein, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>: "Not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them." Therefore it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to tolerate their rites.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the rites of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are compared to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse1">Galatians 5:1</a>, "Be not held again under the yoke of bondage," says: "The bondage of that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not lighter than that of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>." But it would not be allowable for anyone to observe the rites of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, in fact <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes at first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the temples of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to be closed, and afterwards, to be destroyed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei xviii, 54). Therefore it follows that even the rites of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> ought not to be tolerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, unbelief is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> such as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and the like, are not tolerated, but are punishable by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore neither ought the rites of unbelievers to be tolerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Regist. xi, Ep. 15: cf. Decret., dist. xlv, can., Qui sincera] says, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>: "They should be allowed to observe all their feasts, just as hitherto they and their fathers have for ages observed them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> government is derived from the Divine government, and should imitate it. Now although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is all-powerful and supremely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, nevertheless He allows certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to take place in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which He might prevent, lest, without them, greater goods might be forfeited, or greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> ensue. Accordingly in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> government also, those who are in authority, rightly tolerate certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> be incurred: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Ordine ii, 4): "If you do away with harlots, the world will be convulsed with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>." Hence, though unbelievers <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in their rites, they may be tolerated, either on account of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that ensues therefrom, or because of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> avoided. Thus from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> observe their rites, which, of old, foreshadowed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we hold, there follows this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--that our very enemies bear witness to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is represented in a figure, so to speak. For this reason they are tolerated in the observance of their rites.

<p>On the other hand, the rites of other unbelievers, which are neither truthful nor profitable are by no means to be tolerated, except perchance in order to avoid an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or disturbance that might ensue, or some hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who if they were unmolested might gradually be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, at times, has tolerated the rites even of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, when unbelievers were very numerous.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the children of Jews and other unbelievers ought to be baptized against their parents' will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the children of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and of other unbelievers ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their parents' will. For the bond of marriage is stronger than the right of parental authority over children, since the right of parental authority can be made to cease, when a son is set at liberty; whereas the marriage bond cannot be severed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew 19:6</a>: "What . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder." And yet the marriage bond is broken on account of unbelief: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>): "If the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases": and a canon [Can. Uxor legitima, and Idololatria, qu. i] says that "if the unbelieving partner is unwilling to abide with the other, without insult to their Creator, then the other partner is not bound to cohabitation." Much more, therefore, does unbelief abrogate the right of unbelieving parents' authority over their children: and consequently their children may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their parents' will.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one is more bound to succor a man who is in danger of everlasting death, than one who is in danger of temporal death. Now it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if one saw a man in danger of temporal death and failed to go to his aid. Since, then, the children of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and other unbelievers are in danger of everlasting death, should they be left to their parents who would imbue them with their unbelief, it seems that they ought to be taken away from them and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and instructed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the children of a bondsman are themselves bondsmen, and under the power of his master. Now the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are bondsmen of kings and princes: therefore their children are also. Consequently kings and princes have the power to do what they will with Jewish children. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is committed if they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them against their parents' wishes.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs more to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom he has his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than to his carnal father, from whom he has his body. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> if Jewish children be taken away from their parents, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> avails for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> more than preaching does, since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> removes forthwith the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the debt of punishment, and opens the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Now if danger ensue through not preaching, it is imputed to him who omitted to preach, according to the words of <a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 33:6</a> about the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who "sees the sword coming and sounds not the trumpet." Much more therefore, if Jewish children are lost through not being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are they accounted guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who could have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them and did not.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Injustice should be done to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it would be an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> if their children were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their will, since they would lose the rights of parental authority over their children as soon as these were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Therefore these should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their parents' will.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has very great authority and ought to be jealously observed in all things, since the very doctrine of catholic <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> derives its authority from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence we ought to abide by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rather than by that of an <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> or a <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> or of any <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> whatever. Now it was never the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the children of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of their parents, although at times past there have been many very powerful catholic princes like Constantine and Theodosius, with whom most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been on most friendly terms, as Sylvester with Constantine, and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> with Theodosius, who would certainly not have failed to obtain this favor from them if it had been at all reasonable. It seems therefore hazardous to repeat this assertion, that the children of <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> against their parents' wishes, in contradiction to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> custom observed hitherto.

<p>There are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before coming to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, afterwards when they come to perfect age, might easily be persuaded by their parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this would be detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>The other reason is that it is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For a child is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> part of its father: thus, at first, it is not distinct from its parents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within its mother's womb; and later on after birth, and before it has the use of its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, it is enfolded in the care of its parents, which is like a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> womb, for so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, he differs not from an irrational animal; so that even as an ox or a horse belongs to someone who, according to the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, can use them when he likes, as his own instrument, so, according to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, a son, before coming to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is under his father's care. Hence it would be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if a child, before coming to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, were to be taken away from its parents' custody, or anything done to it against its parents' wish. As soon, however, as it begins to have the use of its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, it begins to belong to itself, and is able to look after itself, in matters concerning the Divine or the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, and then it should be induced, not by compulsion but by persuasion, to embrace the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: it can then consent to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even against its parents' wish; but not before it comes to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence it is said of the children of the fathers of old that they were saved in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their parents; whereby we are given to understand that it is the parents' <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to look after the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their children, especially before they come to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the marriage bond, both husband and wife have the use of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and each can assent to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without the other's consent. But this does not apply to a child before it comes to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: yet the comparison holds good after the child has come to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, if it is willing to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> No one should be snatched from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> death against the order of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>: for instance, if a man were condemned by the judge to temporal death, nobody ought to rescue him by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: hence no one ought to break the order of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, whereby a child is in the custody of its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of everlasting death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are bondsmen of princes by civil bondage, which does not exclude the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Hence a child before coming to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of things, is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by its parents' reason, under whose care it lies by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and it is for them to dispose of the child in all matters relating to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The peril that ensues from the omission of preaching, threatens only those who are entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of preaching. Hence it had already been said (<a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse17">Ezekiel 3:17</a>): "I have made thee a watchman to the children [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'house'] of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." On the other hand, to provide the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for the children of unbelievers is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of their parents. Hence it is they whom the danger threatens, if through being deprived of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> their children fail to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.
