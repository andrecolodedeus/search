<h1>Question 110. How angels act on bodies</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1110.htm#article1"> Is the corporeal creature governed by the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1110.htm#article2"> Does the corporeal creature obey the mere will of the angels?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1110.htm#article3"> Can the angels by their own power immediately move bodies locally?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1110.htm#article4"> Can the good or bad angels work miracles?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the corporeal creature is governed by the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the corporeal creature is not governed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For whatever possesses a determinate mode of action, needs not to be governed by any superior power; for we require to be governed lest we do what we ought not. But corporeal things have their actions determined by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> divinely bestowed upon them. Therefore they do not need the government of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the lowest things are ruled by the superior. But some corporeal things are inferior, and others are superior. Therefore they need not be governed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the different orders of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are distinguished by different offices. But if corporeal creatures were ruled by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, there would be as many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices as there are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things. So also there would be as many orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as there are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things; which is against what is laid down above (Question 108, Article 2). Therefore the corporeal creature is not governed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4) that "all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life"; and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 6), that "in this visible world nothing takes place without the agency of the invisible creature."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is generally found both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs and in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things that every particular power is governed and ruled by the universal power; as, for example, the bailiff's power is governed by the power of the king. Among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also, as explained above (55, 3; 108, 1), the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who preside over the inferior possess a more universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now it is manifest that the power of any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> body is more particular than the power of any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; for every corporeal form is a form individualized by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and determined to the "here and now"; whereas immaterial forms are absolute and intelligible. Therefore, as the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who have the less universal forms, are ruled by the superior; so are all corporeal things ruled by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This is not only laid down by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, but also by all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who admit the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">incorporeal substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Corporeal things have determinate actions; but they exercise such actions only according as they are moved; because it belongs to a body not to act unless moved. Hence a corporeal creature must be moved by a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The reason alleged is according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> who laid down (Metaph. xi, 8) that the heavenly bodies are moved by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; the number of which he endeavored to assign according to the number of motions apparent in the heavenly bodies. But he did not say that there were any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> with immediate rule over the inferior bodies, except perhaps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and this was because he did not consider that any operations were exercised in the inferior bodies except the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> ones for which the movement of the heavenly bodies sufficed. But because we assert that many things are done in the inferior bodies besides the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> corporeal actions, for which the movements of the heavenly bodies are not sufficient; therefore in our opinion we must assert that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> possess an immediate presidency not only over the heavenly bodies, but also over the inferior bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Philosophers have held different opinions about immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> laid down that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> were types and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible bodies; and that some were more universal than others; and so he held that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> preside immediately over all sensible bodies, and different ones over different bodies. But <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> held that immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are not the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of sensible bodies, but something higher and more universal; and so he did not attribute to them any immediate presiding over single bodies, but only over the universal agents, the heavenly bodies. <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> followed a middle course. For he agreed with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in supposing some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to preside immediately in the sphere of active and passive elements; because, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also said, he held that the forms of these sensible things are derived from immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But he differed from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> because he supposed only one immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to preside over all inferior bodies, which he called the "active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> held with the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> that different <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> were placed over corporeal things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 79): "Every visible thing in this world has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power placed over it"; and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 4): "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> powers who presided over the terrestrial order"; and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says on the text, "When the ass saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>" (<a href="../bible/num022.htm#verse23">Numbers 22:23</a>), that "the world has need of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who preside over beasts, and over the birth of animals, and trees, and plants, and over the increase of all other things" (Hom. xiv in Num.). The reason of this, however, is not that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is more fitted by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to preside over animals than over plants; because each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, even the least, has a higher and more universal power than any kind of corporeal things: the reason is to be sought in the order of Divine wisdom, Who places different rulers over different things. Nor does it follow that there are more than nine orders of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because, as above expounded (108, 2), the orders are distinguished by their general offices. Hence as according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whose proper office it is to preside over the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are of the order of the "powers"; so to the order of the "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" do those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> seem to belong who preside over purely corporeal creatures; for by their ministration <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are sometimes performed.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether corporeal matter obeys the mere will of an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys the mere will of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For the power of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> excels the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys a conception of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for the body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is changed by a conception of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as regards heat and cold, and sometimes even as regards health and sickness. Therefore much more is corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> changed by a conception of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever can be done by an inferior power, can be done by a superior power. Now the power of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is superior to corporeal power. But a body by its power is able to transform corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as appears when fire begets fire. Therefore much more efficaciously can an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by his power transform corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is under <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> administration, as appears above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), and thus it appears that bodies are as instruments to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for an instrument is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> a mover moved. Now in effects there is something that is due to the power of their principal agents, and which cannot be due to the power of the instrument; and this it is that takes the principal place in the effect. For example, digestion is due to the force of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, which is the instrument of the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but that living flesh is thus generated is due to the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Again the cutting of the wood is from the saw; but that it assumes the length the form of a bed is from the design of the [joiner's] art. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form which takes the principal place in the corporeal effects, is due to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in receiving its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says "It is not to be thought, that this visible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys these rebel <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for it obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> [Phaedo. xlix: Tim. (Did.) vol. ii, p. 218 asserted that the forms which are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by immaterial forms, because they said that the material forms are participations of immaterial forms. <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> followed them in this opinion to some extent, for he said that all forms which are in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> proceed from the concept of the "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>"; and that corporeal agents only dispose [<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>] for the forms. They seem to have been deceived on this point, through supposing a form to be something made "per se," so that it would be the effect of a formal principle. But, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 8), what is made, properly speaking, is the "composite": for this properly speaking, is, as it were, what subsists. Whereas the form is called a being, not as that which is, but as that by which something is; and consequently neither is a form, properly speaking, made; for that is made which is; since to be is nothing but the way to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Now it is manifest that what is made is like to the maker, forasmuch as every agent makes its like. So whatever makes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, has a likeness to the composite; either because it is composite itself, as when fire begets fire, or because the whole "composite" as to both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> is within its power; and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore every informing of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is either immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or form some corporeal agent; but not immediately from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as the form; and so it is not surprising for the body to be formally changed by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> concept; especially as the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is accompanied with a certain bodily change, is subject to the command of reason. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, however, has not the same connection with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies; and hence the argument does not hold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever an inferior power can do, that a superior power can do, not in the same way, but in a more excellent way; for example, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> sensible things in a more excellent way than sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them. So an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in a more excellent way than can corporeal agents, that is by moving the corporeal agents themselves, as being the superior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is nothing to prevent some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effect taking place by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power, for which the power of corporeal agents would not suffice. This, however, is not to obey an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will (as neither does <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obey the mere will of a cook, when by regulating the fire according to the prescription of his art he produces a dish that the fire could not have produced by itself); since to reduce <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the act of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form does not exceed the power of a corporeal agent; for it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for like to make like.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether bodies obey the angels as regards local motion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that bodies do not obey the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in local motion. For the local motion of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies follows on their forms. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the forms of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Therefore neither can they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in them local motion.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. viii, 7) proves that local motion is the first of all movements. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> other movements by a formal change of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore neither can they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> local motion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the corporeal members obey the concept of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as regards local movement, as having in themselves some principle of life. In <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, however, there is not vital principle. Therefore they do not obey the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in local motion.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8,9) that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> use corporeal seed to produce certain effects. But they cannot do this without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> local movement. Therefore bodies obey them in local motion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii): "Divine wisdom has joined the ends of the first to the principles of the second." Hence it is clear that the inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> at its highest point is in conjunction with superior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is below the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But among all corporeal movements the most perfect is local motion, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Phys. viii, 7). The reason of this is that what is moved locally is not as such in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to anything intrinsic, but only to something extrinsic--that is, to place. Therefore the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude to be moved immediately by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as regards place. Hence also the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> asserted that the supreme bodies are moved locally by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>; whence we see that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moves the body first and chiefly by a local motion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are in bodies other local movements besides those which result from the forms; for instance, the ebb and flow of the sea does not follow from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form of the water, but from the influence of the moon; and much more can local movements result from the power of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> local motion, as the first motion, can thereby <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> other movements; that is, by employing corporeal agents to produce these effects, as a workman employs fire to soften iron.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not so limited as is the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence the motive power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is limited to the body united to it, which is vivified by it, and by which it can move other things. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power is not limited to any body; hence it can move locally bodies not joined to it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether angels can work miracles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "Those spirits are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by whom signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are usually done."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 79) that "magicians work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by private contracts; <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, bad <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the signs of public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." But magicians work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> because they are "heard by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>," as he says elsewhere in the same work [Cf. Liber xxi, Sentent., sent. 4: among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>]. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Therefore much more can the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in the same work [Cf. Liber xxi, Sentent., sent. 4: among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>] that "it is not absurd to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all the things we see happen may be brought about by the lower powers that dwell in our atmosphere." But when an effect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is produced outside the order of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we call it a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, as, for instance, when anyone is cured of a fever without the operation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, superior power is not subject to the order of an inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is inferior to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can work outside the order of corporeal agents; which is to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse4">Psalm 135:4</a>): "Who alone doth great wonders."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> properly so called is when something is done outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it is not enough for a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> if something is done outside the order of any particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for otherwise anyone would perform a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by throwing a stone upwards, as such a thing is outside the order of the stone's <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. So for a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is required that it be against the order of the whole <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can do this, because, whatever an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or any other creature does by its own power, is according to the order of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus it is not a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are said to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; either because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at their request, in the same way as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are said to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; or because they exercise a kind of ministry in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which take place; as in collecting the dust in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>, or by doing something of that kind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Properly speaking, as said above, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are those things which are done outside the order of the whole <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But as we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the power of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it follows that when anything is done outside the order of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by a power unknown to us, it is called a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> as regards ourselves. So when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do anything of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, these things are called "<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>" not in an absolute sense, but in reference to ourselves. In this way the magicians work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and these are said to be done by "private contracts," forasmuch as every power of the creature, in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, may be compared to the power of a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in a city. Hence when a magician does anything by compact with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, this is done as it were by private contract. On the other hand, the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in the city. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so far as they work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, are said to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by "public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>": but bad <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the "signs of public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," as by invoking the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or by making use of other sacred signs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Spiritual powers are able to effect whatever happens in this visible world, by employing corporeal seeds by local movement.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can do something which is outside the order of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet they cannot do anything outside the whole <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> order, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, as above explained.
