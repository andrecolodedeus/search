<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether grace implies anything in the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not imply anything in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gen039.htm#verse21">Genesis 39:21</a>) that the Lord gave to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'favor'] in the sight of the chief keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>." Now when we say that a man has the favor of another, nothing is implied in him who has the favor of the other, but an acceptance is implied in him whose favor he has. Hence when we say that a man has the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing is implied in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but we merely signify the Divine acceptance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quickens the body so does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> quicken the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>): "He is thy life." Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quickens the body immediately. Therefore nothing can come as a medium between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> implies nothing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse7">Romans 1:7</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> to you and peace," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a>, i.e. the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> implies nothing in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who does not impute the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse2">Psalm 31:2</a>: "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom the Lord hath not imputed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Hence neither does <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> imply anything in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Light implies something in what is enlightened. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a light of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Natura et Gratia xxii): "The light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rightly deserts the prevaricator of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and those who have been thus deserted become blind." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> implies something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the common manner of speech, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is usually taken in three ways. First, for anyone's love, as we are accustomed to say that the soldier is in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the king, i.e. the king looks on him with favor. Secondly, it is taken for any <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> freely bestowed, as we are accustomed to say: I do you this act of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Thirdly, it is taken for the recompense of a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> given "gratis," inasmuch as we are said to be "grateful" for benefits. Of these three the second depends on the first, since one bestows something on another "gratis" from the love wherewith he receives him into his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>." And from the second proceeds the third, since from benefits bestowed "gratis" arises "gratitude."

<p>Now as regards the last two, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> implies something in him who receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: first, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> given gratis; secondly, the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. But as regards the first, a difference must be noted between the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for since the creature's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> springs from the Divine will, some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the creature flows from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love, whereby He wishes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the creature. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is moved by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in things; and hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> love does not wholly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the thing, but pre-supposes it either in part or wholly. Therefore it is clear that every love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is followed at some time by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in the creature, but not co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> love. And according to this difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the creature is looked at differently. For one is common, whereby He loves "all things that are" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse25">Wisdom 11:25</a>), and thereby gives things their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being. But the second is a special love, whereby He draws the rational creature above the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and according to this love He is said to love anyone simply, since it is by this love that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply wishes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is Himself, for the creature.

<p>Accordingly when a man is said to have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is signified something bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes signifies <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> love, as we say the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gratuitously and not from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> predestines or elects some; for it is written (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians 1:5</a>): "He hath <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us into the adoption of children . . . unto the praise of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even when a man is said to be in another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, it is understood that there is something in him pleasing to the other; even as anyone is said to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>--with this difference, that what is pleasing to a man in another is presupposed to his love, but whatever is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a man is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the Divine love, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after the manner of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now there is no medium between form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since the form, of itself, "informs" the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject; whereas the agent "informs" the subject, not by its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but by the form, which it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 25): "When I said that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and peace for our reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you must not take it to mean that peace and reconciliation do not pertain to general peace, but that the special name of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> signifies the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Not only <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, therefore, but many other of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> pertain to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And hence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not take place without some effect divinely <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us, as will appear later (113, 2).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether grace is a quality of the soul?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> acts on its subject, since the action of a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is not without the action of its subject, and thus the subject would <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> act upon itself. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> acts upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by justifying it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Furthermore, <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nobler than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since we can do many things by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not equal, as stated above (109, A1,2,3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Furthermore, no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> remains after it has ceased to be in its subject. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> remains; since it is not corrupted, for thus it would be reduced to nothing, since it was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> from nothing; hence it is called a "new creature"(<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse15">Galatians 6:15</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> on <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse15">Psalm 103:15</a>: "That he may make the face cheerful with oil"; the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is a certain beauty of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which wins the Divine love." But beauty of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, even as beauty of body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), there is understood to be an effect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gratuitous will in whoever is said to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now it was stated (109, 1) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is aided by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gratuitous will in two ways: first, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or will or do something, and in this way the gratuitous effect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for "motion is the act of the mover in the moved." Secondly, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gratuitous will, inasmuch as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and for this reason, that it is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should provide less for those He loves, that they may acquire <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, than for creatures, whom He loves that they may acquire <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now He so provides for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> creatures, that not merely does He move them to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> acts, but He bestows upon them certain forms and powers, which are the principles of acts, in order that they may of themselves be inclined to these movements, and thus the movements whereby they are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> become <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and easy to creatures, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>: "she . . . ordereth all things sweetly." Much more therefore does He infuse into such as He moves towards the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, certain forms or <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, whereby they may be moved by Him sweetly and promptly to acquire <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and thus the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, is said to act upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not after the manner of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">formal</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as whiteness makes a thing white, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, just.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is either the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing whereof it is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or is a part of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> are called <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, but is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now what is substantially in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, becomes <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> participating the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as is clear in the case of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And thus because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> participates in the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> imperfectly, the participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, has its being in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a less perfect way than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subsists in itself. Nevertheless, inasmuch as it is the expression or participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, it is nobler than the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, though not in its mode of being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> [Pseudo-Bede, Sent. Phil. ex Artist] says, the "being of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is to inhere." Hence no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is called being as if it had being, but because by it something is; hence it is said to belong to a being rather to be a being (Metaph. vii, text. 2). And because to become and to be corrupted belong to what is, properly speaking, no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> comes into being or is corrupted, but is said to come into being and to be corrupted inasmuch as its subject begins or ceases to be in act with this <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> inasmuch as men are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with reference to it, i.e. are given a new being out of nothing, i.e. not from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse10">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "<a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether grace is the same as virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Spir. et Lit. xiv) that "operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what fits the definition, fits the defined. But the definitions of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> given by <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> fit <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since "it makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," and "it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whereby we live righteously," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Now it is clearly not in the "fourth" <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; viz. "form" which is the "abiding figure of things," since it does not belong to bodies. Nor is it in the "third," since it is not a "passion nor a passion-like <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>," which is in the sensitive part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Physic. viii; and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is principally in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Nor is it in the "second" <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power" or "impotence"; since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and does not regard <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as does <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. Therefore it must be in the "first" <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which is "<a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" or "disposition." Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; since even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> after a manner, as stated above (57, A1,2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it would seem before all to be one of the three theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is neither <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor hope, for these can be without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> foreruns <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book on the Predestination of the Saints (De Dono Persev. xvi). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some held that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> were identical in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and differed only <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>--in the sense that we speak of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> inasmuch as it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or is given gratuitously--and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> inasmuch as it empowers us to act rightly. And the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> seems to have thought this (Sent. ii, D 27).

<p>But if anyone rightly considers the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this cannot hold, since, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Physic. vii, text. 17), "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is disposition of what is perfect--and I call perfect what is disposed according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now from this it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing has reference to some pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from the fact that everything is disposed with reference to what befits its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> acquired by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> of which we spoke above (55, seqq.) are dispositions, whereby a man is fittingly disposed with reference to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> whereby he is a man; whereas infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a higher manner and towards a higher end, and consequently in relation to some higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. in relation to a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: "He hath given us most great and most precious promises; that by these you may be made partakers of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>." And it is in respect of receiving this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that we are said to be born again sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>And thus, even as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of reason is something besides the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are ordained to this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light, so also the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is something besides the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are derived from and are ordained to this light, hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians 5:8</a>): "For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light." For as the acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> enable a man to walk, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so do the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> enable a man to walk as befits the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> calls "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of him that worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the first act by which <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is manifested.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Good is placed in the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with reference to its fitness with some pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> or participated. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in this manner, but as to the root of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is reduced to the first <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; and yet it is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is a certain disposition which is presupposed to the infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as their principle and root.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether grace is in the essence of the soul as in a subject, or in one of the powers?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in a subject, but in one of the powers. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Hypognosticon iii [Among the spurious works of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>]) that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is related to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> "as a rider to his horse." Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is a power, as stated above (I, 83, 2). Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is in a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in a subject.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Man's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> springs from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Gratia et Lib. Arbit. vi). Now <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> consists in acts, which proceed from a power. Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a perfection of a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the proper subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it has an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, must be capable of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; since it would follow that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be capable of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the proper subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is prior to its powers. Now what is prior may be understood without what is posterior. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be taken to be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, although we suppose no part or power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--viz. neither the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, nor anything else; which is impossible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are born again sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But generation terminates at the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> prior to the powers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> prior to being in the powers.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This question depends on the preceding. For if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be in the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as in a subject; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers are the proper subject of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 56, Article 1). But if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it cannot be said that a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since every perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (55, 1; 56, 1). Hence it remains that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as it is prior to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, has a subject prior to the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that it is in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> powers participates in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in his power of will participates in the Divine love through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so also in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does he participate in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, after the manner of a likeness, through a certain regeneration or re-creation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> flows its powers, which are the principles of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so likewise the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby the powers are moved to act, flow into the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as the mover to the moved, which is the same comparison as that of a horseman to the horse--but not as an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to a subject.

<p>And thereby is made clear the Reply to the Second Objection. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works through the medium of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principal of vital <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> through the medium of the powers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as being in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not classed in a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by any of its powers, since the powers are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> following upon the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> differs specifically in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, viz. of dumb animals, and of plants. Consequently it does not follow that, if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be the subject of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inasmuch as it is of such a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Since the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> properties following upon the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be without them. Yet, granted that it was without them, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would still be called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or rational in its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, not that it would actually have these powers, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of such a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, from which these powers <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> flow.
