<h1>Question 110. The vices opposed to truth, and first of lying</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3110.htm#article1"> Is lying, as containing falsehood, always opposed to truth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3110.htm#article2"> The species of lying</a> <li><a href="../summa/3110.htm#article3"> Is lying always a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3110.htm#article4"> Is it always a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether lying is always opposed to truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that lying is not always opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For opposites are incompatible with one another. But lying is compatible with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since that speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, thinking it to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, lies, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Lib. De Mendac. iii). Therefore lying is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> applies not only to words but also to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7) by this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> one tells the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> both in one's speech and in one's life. But lying applies only to words, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Mend. xii) that "a lie is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> signification by words." Accordingly, it seems that lying is not directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. De Mendac. iii) that the "liar's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the desire to deceive." But this is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but rather to benevolence or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore lying is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Mend. x): "Let no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to tell a falsehood in order to deceive. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statement uttered with intent to deceive is a manifest lie." But this is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore lying is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A moral act takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from two things, its object, and its end: for the end is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the first mover in moral acts. And the power moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> has its own object, which is the proximate object of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act, and stands in relation to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> act towards the end, as material to formal, as stated above (I-II, 18, 6,7).

<p>Now it has been said above (109, 1, ad 3) that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>--and consequently the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>--regards a manifestation made by certain signs: and this manifestation or statement is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> comparing sign with the thing signified; because every representation consists in comparison, which is the proper act of the reason. Wherefore though dumb animals manifest something, yet they do not intend to manifest anything: but they do something by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, and a manifestation is the result. But when this manifestation or statement is a moral act, it must needs be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and dependent on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now the proper object of a manifestation or statement is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a bad will may bear on two things: one of which is that a falsehood may be told; while the other is the proper effect of a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statement, namely, that someone may be deceived.

<p>Accordingly if these three things concur, namely, falsehood of what is said, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to tell a falsehood, and finally the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to deceive, then there is falsehood--materially, since what is said is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, formally, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to tell an untruth, and effectively, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to impart a falsehood.

<p>However, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> notion of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is taken from formal falsehood, from the fact namely, that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intends to say what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; wherefore also the word "mendacium" [lie] is derived from its being in opposition to the "mind." Consequently if one says what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, thinking it to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> materially, but not formally, because the falseness is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker so that it is not a perfect lie, since what is beside the speaker's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> for which reason it cannot be a specific difference. If, on the other hand, one utters' falsehood formally, through having the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to deceive, even if what one says be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet inasmuch as this is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and moral act, it contains falseness <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, and attains the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.

<p>That a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intends to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> another to have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion, by deceiving him, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of lying, but to perfection thereof, even as in the physical order, a thing acquires its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> if it has its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, even though the form's effect be lacking; for instance a heavy body which is held up aloft by force, lest it come down in accordance with the exigency of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore it is evident that lying is directly an formally opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We judge of a thing according to what is in it formally and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> rather than according to what is in it materially and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Hence it is more in opposition to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, considered as a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of telling a falsehood than to tell a falsehood with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii), words hold the chief place among other signs. And so when it is said that "a lie is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> signification by words," the term "words" denotes every kind of sign. Wherefore if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intended to signify something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by means of signs, he would not be excused from lying.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The desire to deceive belongs to the perfection of lying, but not to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as neither does any effect belong to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether lies are sufficiently divided into officious, jocose, and mischievous lies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that lies are not sufficiently divided into "officious," "jocose" and "mischievous" lies. For a division should be made according to that which pertains to a thing by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Metaph. vii, text. 43; De Part. Animal i, 3). But seemingly the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the effect resulting from a moral act is something beside and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that act, so that an indefinite number of effects can result from one act. Now this division is made according to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the effect: for a "jocose" lie is told in order to make fun, an "officious" lie for some useful purpose, and a "mischievous" lie in order to injure someone. Therefore lies are unfittingly divided in this way.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Mendac. xiv) gives eight kinds of lies. The first is "in religious doctrine"; the second is "a lie that profits no one and injures someone"; the third "profits one party so as to injure another"; the fourth is "told out of mere <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of lying and deceiving"; the fifth is "told out of the desire to please"; the sixth "injures no one, and profits someone in saving his money"; the seventh "injures no one and profits someone in saving him from death"; the eighth "injures no one, and profits someone in saving him from defilement of the body." Therefore it seems that the first division of lies is insufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7) divides lying into "boasting," which exceeds the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in speech, and "irony," which falls short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by saying something less: and these two are not contained under any one of the kinds mentioned above. Therefore it seems that the aforesaid division of lies is inadequate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a>, "Thou wilt destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>," says "that there are three kinds of lies; for some are told for the wellbeing and convenience of someone; and there is another kind of lie that is told in fun; but the third kind of lie is told out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>." The first of these is called an officious lie, the second a jocose lie, the third a mischievous lie. Therefore lies are divided into these three kinds.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Lies may be divided in three ways. First, with respect to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as lies: and this is the proper and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> division of lying. On this way, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7), lies are of two kinds, namely, the lie which goes beyond the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this belongs to "boasting," and the lie which stops short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this belongs to "irony." This division is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> division of lying itself, because lying as such is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated in the preceding Article: and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a kind of equality, to which more and less are in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> opposition.

<p>Secondly, lies may be divided with respect to their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and with regard to those things that aggravate or diminish the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying, on the part of the end intended. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying is aggravated, if by lying a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intends to injure another, and this is called a "mischievous" lie, while the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying is diminished if it be directed to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--either of pleasure and then it is a "jocose" lie, or of usefulness, and then we have the "officious" lie, whereby it is intended to help another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or to save him from being injured. On this way lies are divided into the three kinds aforesaid.

<p>Thirdly, lies are divided in a more general way, with respect to their relation to some end, whether or not this increase or diminish their gravity: and in this way the division comprises eight kinds, as stated in the Second Objection. Here the first three kinds are contained under "mischievous" lies, which are either against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then we have the lie "in religious doctrine," or against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and this either with the sole <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of injuring him, and then it is the second kind of lie, which "profits no one, and injures someone"; or with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of injuring one and at the same time profiting another, and this is the third kind of lie, "which profits one, and injures another." Of these the first is the most grievous, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are always more grievous, as stated above (I-II, 73, 3): and the second is more grievous than the third, since the latter's gravity is diminished by the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of profiting another.

<p>After these three, which aggravate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying, we have a fourth, which has its own measure of gravity without addition or diminution; and this is the lie which is told "out of mere <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of lying and deceiving." This proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "the liar, when he lies from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, delights in lying."

<p>The four kinds that follow lessen the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying. For the fifth kind is the jocose lie, which is told "with a desire to please": and the remaining three are comprised under the officious lie, wherein something useful to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is intended. This usefulness regards either external things, and then we have the sixth kind of lie, which "profits someone in saving his money"; or his body, and this is the seventh kind, which "saves a man from death"; or the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this is the eighth kind, which "saves him from unlawful defilement of his body."

<p>Now it is evident that the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intended, the more is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying diminished in gravity. Wherefore a careful consideration of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> will show that these various kinds of lies are enumerated in their order of gravity: since the useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is better than the pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and life of the body than money, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than the life of the body.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether every lie is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is evident that the evangelists did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the writing of the Gospel. Yet they seem to have told something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: since their accounts of the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of others often differ from one another: wherefore seemingly one of them must have given an <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> account. Therefore not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one is rewarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the midwives of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were rewarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, for it is stated that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> built them houses" (<a href="../bible/exo001.htm#verse21">Exodus 1:21</a>). Therefore a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are related in Sacred Writ that they may be a model of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. But we read of certain very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men that they lied. Thus (<a href="../bible/gen012.htm">Genesis 12</a> and <a href="../bible/gen020.htm">20</a>) we are told that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said of his wife that she was his sister. <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> also lied when he said that he was <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, and yet he received a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> (<a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse27">Genesis 27:27-29</a>). Again, Judith is commended (<a href="../bible/jth015.htm#verse10">Judith 15:10-11</a>) although she lied to Holofernes. Therefore not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, one ought to choose the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in order to avoid the greater: even so a physician cuts off a limb, lest the whole body perish. Yet less harm is done by raising a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> mind, than by someone slaying or being slain. Therefore a man may lawfully lie, to save another from committing <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or another from being killed.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> not to fulfill what one has promised. Yet one is not bound to keep all one's promises: for <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Synonym. ii): "Break your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> when you have promised ill." Therefore not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, apparently a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because thereby we deceive our neighbor: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. De Mend. xxi): "Whoever thinks that there is any kind of lie that is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deceives himself shamefully, since he deems himself an honest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he deceives others." Yet not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of deception, since no one is deceived by a jocose lie; seeing that lies of this kind are told, not with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but merely for the sake of giving pleasure. Hence again we find hyperbolical expressions in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Therefore not every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse14">Sirach 7:14</a>): "Be not willing to make any manner of lie."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An action that is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in respect of its genus can by no means be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and lawful, since in order for an action to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> it must be right in every respect: because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> results from a complete <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results from any single defect, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Div. Nom. iv). Now a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in respect of its genus, since it is an action bearing on undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For as words are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> signs of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> acts, it is unnatural and undue for anyone to signify by words something that is not in his mind. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "lying is in itself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to be shunned, while truthfulness is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and worthy of praise." Therefore every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Contra Mend. i).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is unlawful to hold that any <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assertion is contained either in the Gospel or in any canonical <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, or that the writers thereof have told untruths, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would be deprived of its <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> which is based on the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. That the words of certain people are variously reported in the Gospel and other sacred writings does not constitute a lie. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Consens. Evang. ii): "He that has the wit to understand that in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to get at the sense, will conclude that he must not be the least troubled, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by what words that sense is expressed." Hence it is evident, as he adds (De Consens. Evang. ii), that "we must not judge that someone is lying, if several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> fail to describe in the same way and in the same words a thing which they remember to have seen or heard."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The midwives were rewarded, not for their lie, but for their fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>-will, which latter led them to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. Hence it is expressly stated (<a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse21">Exodus 2:21</a>): "And because the midwives feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He built them houses." But the subsequent lie was not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Lib. De Mend. v), the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are related as examples of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liars</a>. If, however, any of their statements appear to be untruthful, we must understand such statements to have been figurative and prophetic. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. De Mend. v): "We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that whatever is related of those who, in prophetical times, are mentioned as being worthy of credit, was done and said by them <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>." As to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "when he said that Sara was his sister, he wished to hide the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, for she is called his sister since she was the daughter of his father," <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Super. Gen. xxvi; Contra Mend. x; Contra Faust. xxii). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself said (<a href="../bible/gen020.htm#verse12">Genesis 20:12</a>): "She is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother," being related to him on his father's side. <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> assertion that he was <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac's</a> <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, was spoken in a mystical sense, because, to wit, the latter's birthright was due to him by right: and he made use of this mode of speech being moved by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, in order to signify a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, namely, that the younger people, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, should supplant the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>Some, however, are commended in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, not on account of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but for a certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> disposition, seeing that it was owing to some praiseworthy sentiment that they were moved to do certain undue things. It is thus that Judith is praised, not for lying to Holofernes, but for her desire to save the people, to which end she exposed herself to danger. And yet one might also say that her words contain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in some mystical sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A lie is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> not only because it injures one's neighbor, but also on account of its inordinateness, as stated above in this Article. Now it is not allowed to make use of anything inordinate in order to ward off injury or defects from another: as neither is it lawful to steal in order to give an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, except perhaps in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> when all things are common. Therefore it is not lawful to tell a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> in order to deliver another from any danger whatever. Nevertheless it is lawful to hide the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> prudently, by keeping it back, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Mend. x).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not lie, so long as he has a mind to do what he promises, because he does not speak contrary to what he has in mind: but if he does not keep his promise, he seems to act without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in changing his mind. He may, however, be excused for two reasons. First, if he has promised something evidently unlawful, because he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in promise, and did well to change his mind. Secondly, if circumstances have changed with regard to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and the business in hand. For, as Seneca states (De Benef. iv), for a man to be bound to keep a promise, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for everything to remain unchanged: otherwise neither did he lie in promising--since he promised what he had in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, due circumstances being taken for granted--nor was he faithless in not keeping his promise, because circumstances are no longer the same. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, though he did not go to Corinth, whither he had promised to go (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm">2 Corinthians 1</a>), did not lie, because obstacles had arisen which prevented him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> An action may be considered in two ways. First, in itself, secondly, with regard to the agent. Accordingly a jocose lie, from the very genus of the action, is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to deceive; although in the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the speaker it is not told to deceive, nor does it deceive by the way it is told. Nor is there any similarity in the hyperbolical or any kind of figurative expressions, with which we meet in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>: because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. De Mend. v), "it is not a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to do or say a thing figuratively: because every statement must be referred to the thing stated: and when a thing is done or said figuratively, it states what those to whom it is tendered understand it to signify."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether every lie is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that every lie is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse7">Psalm 6:7</a>): "Thou wilt destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>," and (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse11">Wisdom 1:11</a>): "The mouth that belieth killeth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> destruction and death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore every lie is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is against a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now lying is against this precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: "Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness." Therefore every lie is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 36): "Every liar breaks his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in lying, since forsooth he wishes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he lies to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him, and yet he does not keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with him, when he lies to him: and whoever breaks his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." Now no one is said to break his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or "to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>," for a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore no lie is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward is not lost save for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, for a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward was lost, being exchanged for a temporal meed. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xviii) that "we learn from the reward of the midwives what the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying deserves: since the reward which they deserved for their kindness, and which they might have received in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, dwindled into a temporal meed on account of the lie of which they were guilty." Therefore even an officious lie, such as was that of the midwives, which seemingly is the least of lies, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Lib. De Mend. xvii) that "it is a precept of perfection, not only not to lie at all, but not even to wish to lie." Now it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to act against a precept. Therefore every lie of the perfect is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and consequently so also is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> told by anyone else, otherwise the perfect would be worse off than others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a>, "Thou wilt destroy," etc.: "There are two kinds of lie, that are not grievously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> yet are not devoid of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when we lie either in joking, or for the sake of our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." But every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is grievous. Therefore jocose and officious lies are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, properly speaking, one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives in union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (24, 12; 35, 3). Now a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> may be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in three ways: first, in itself; secondly, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intended; thirdly, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>.

<p>A lie may be in itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> signification. For if this be about divine things, it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> one hides or corrupts by such a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; so that a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> of this kind is opposed not only to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion: wherefore it is a most grievous and a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> signification be about something the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which affects a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for instance if it pertain to the perfection of science or to moral conduct, a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> of this description inflicts an injury on one's neighbor, since it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> him to have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion, wherefore it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as regards the love of our neighbor, and consequently is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand, if the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion engendered by the lie be about some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is of no consequence, then the lie in question does no harm to one's neighbor; for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be deceived as to some contingent particulars that do not concern him. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> of this kind, considered in itself, is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>As regards the end in view, a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> may be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, through being told with the purpose of injuring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is opposed to religion; or in order to injure one's neighbor, in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, his possessions or his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, and this also is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to injure one's neighbor, and one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally if one has merely the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of committing a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if the end intended be not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, neither will the lie, considered under this aspect, be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as in the case of a jocose lie, where some little pleasure is intended, or in an officious lie, where the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also of one's neighbor is intended. Accidentally a lie may be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or any other injury resulting therefrom: and thus again it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance if a man were not deterred through <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> from lying publicly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passages quoted refer to the mischievous lie, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains the words of <a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a>, "Thou wilt destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are directed to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor, as stated above (44, 1, ad 3; I-II, 100, 5, ad 1), a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, in so far as it is contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. Hence it is expressly forbidden to bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be called "<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>" in a broad sense, in so far as it is beside the equity of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse4">1 John 3:4</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'And <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.']." It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The lie of the midwives may be considered in two ways. First as regards their feeling of kindliness towards the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and their reverence and fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for which their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> disposition is commended. For this an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward is due. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (in his exposition of <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse21">Isaiah 65:21</a>, 'And they shall build houses') explains that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "built them <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> houses." Secondly, it may be considered with regard to the external act of lying. For thereby they could <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, not indeed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward, but perhaps some temporal meed, the deserving of which was not inconsistent with the deformity of their lie, though this was inconsistent with their meriting an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward. It is in this sense that we must understand the words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, and not that they <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> by that lie to lose the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward as though they had already <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it by their preceding kindliness, as the objection understands the words to mean.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Some say that for the perfect every lie is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this assertion is unreasonable. For no circumstance <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more grievous unless it transfers it to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not transfer a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, except perhaps by reason of something annexed to that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for instance if it be against his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: and this cannot apply to an officious or jocose lie. Wherefore an officious or a jocose lie is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in perfect men, except perhaps <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. We may take in this sense the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> that "it is a precept of perfection not only not to lie at all, but not even to wish to lie": although <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says this not positively but dubiously, for he begins by saying: "Unless perhaps it is a precept," etc. Nor does it matter that they are placed in a position to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: because they are bound to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by virtue of their office in judging or teaching, and if they lie in these matters their lie will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but it does not follow that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally when they lie in other matters.
