<h1>Question 111. Dissimulation and hypocrisy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3111.htm#article1"> Is all dissimulation a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3111.htm#article2"> Is hypocrisy dissimulation?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3111.htm#article3"> Is it opposed to truth?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3111.htm#article4"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether all dissimulation is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that not all dissimulation is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse28">Luke 24:28</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "pretended [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'made as though'] he would go farther"; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in his book on the Patriarchs (De <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> i) says of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that he "spoke craftily to his servants, when he said" (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse5">Genesis 22:5</a>): "I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you." Now to pretend and to speak craftily savor of dissimulation: and yet it is not to be said that there was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Therefore not all dissimulation is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is profitable. But according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, in his commentary on <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians 2:11</a>, "When Peter [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Cephas'] was come to Antioch:--The example of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who slew the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, pretending that he desired to worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, should teach us that dissimulation is useful and sometimes to be employed"; and David "changed his countenance before" Achis, king of Geth (<a href="../bible/1sa021.htm#verse13">1 Samuel 21:13</a>). Therefore not all dissimulation is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to simulate <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to simulate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written in condemnation of certain people (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a>): "They have proclaimed abroad their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as Sodom, and they have not hid it." Now it pertains to dissimulation to hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is reprehensible sometimes not to simulate. But it is never reprehensible to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore dissimulation is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa016.htm#verse14">Isaiah 16:14</a>, "In three years," etc., says: "Of the two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> it is less to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> openly than to simulate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>." But to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> openly is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore dissimulation is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (109, 3; 110, 1), it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to show oneself outwardly by outward signs to be such as one is. Now outward signs are not only words, but also <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Accordingly just as it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to signify by words something different from that which is in one's mind, so also is it contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to employ signs of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or things to signify the contrary of what is in oneself, and this is what is properly denoted by dissimulation. Consequently dissimulation is properly a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> told by the signs of outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now it matters not whether one lie in word or in any other way, as stated above (110, 1, Objection 2). Wherefore, since every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (Question 110, Article 3), it follows that also all dissimulation is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De QQ. Evang. ii), "To pretend is not always a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>: but only when the pretense has no signification, then it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. When, however, our pretense refers to some signification, there is no lie, but a representation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." And he cites figures of speech as an example, where a thing is "pretended," for we do not mean it to be taken literally but as a figure of something else that we wish to say. On this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "pretended He would go farther," because He acted as if wishing to go farther; in order to signify something figuratively either because He was far from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxiii in Ev.); or, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De QQ. Evang. ii), because, "as He was about to go farther away from them by <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into heaven</a>, He was, so to speak, held back on earth by their hospitality."

<p><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> also spoke figuratively. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> i) says that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> "foretold what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not": for he intended to return alone after sacrificing his son: but by his mouth the Lord expressed what He was about to do. It is evident therefore that neither dissembled.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> employs the term "simulation" in a broad sense for any kind of pretense. David's change of countenance was a figurative pretense, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes in commenting on the title of <a href="../bible/psa033.htm">Psalm 33</a>, "I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Lord at all times." There is no need to excuse <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu's</a> dissimulation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or lie, because he was a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since he departed not from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of Jeroboam (<a href="../bible/2ki010.htm#verse29">2 Kings 10:29-31</a>). And yet he is praised withal and received an earthly reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not for his dissimulation, but for his zeal in destroying the worship of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some say that no one may pretend to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, because no one pretends to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and if he do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But this argument proves nothing. Because a man might pretend to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by doing what is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself but has some appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and nevertheless this dissimulation is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both because it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and because it gives <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; and although he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> on this account, yet his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> he simulates. And because dissimulation is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, its sinfulness is not derived from the thing simulated, whether this be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as a man lies when he signifies by word that which he is not, yet lies not when he refrains from saying what he is, for this is sometimes lawful; so also does a man dissemble, when by outward signs of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or things he signifies that which he is not, yet he dissembles not if he omits to signify what he is. Hence one may hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without being guilty of dissimulation. It is thus that we must understand the saying of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on the words of <a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse9">Isaiah 3:9</a>, that the "second remedy after shipwreck is to hide one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," lest, to wit, others be scandalized thereby.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether hypocrisy is the same as dissimulation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that hypocrisy is not the same as dissimulation. For dissimulation consists in lying by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. But there may be hypocrisy in showing outwardly what one does inwardly, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse2">Matthew 6:2</a>, "When thou dost an alms-deed sound not a trumpet before thee, as the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> do." Therefore hypocrisy is not the same as dissimulation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 7): "Some there are who wear the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, yet are unable to attain the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of perfection. We must by no means deem these to have joined the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, since it is one thing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from weakness, and another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>." Now those who wear the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without attaining the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of perfection, are dissemblers, since the outward <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> signifies works of perfection. Therefore dissimulation is not the same as hypocrisy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hypocrisy consists in the mere <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says of <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse5">Matthew 23:5</a>) that "all their works they do for to be seen of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 7) that "they never consider what it is that they do, but how by their every action they may please men." But dissimulation consists, not in the mere <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but in the outward action: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse13">Job 36:13</a>, "Dissemblers and crafty men <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," says that "the dissembler simulates one thing and does another: he pretends <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and delights in lewdness, he makes a show of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and fills his purse." Therefore hypocrisy is not the same as dissimulation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "'Hypocrite' is a Greek word corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'simulator,' for whereas he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> within," he "shows himself outwardly as being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; <em>hypo</em> denoting falsehood, and <em>krisis</em>, judgment."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x), "the word hypocrite is derived from the appearance of those who come on to the stage with a disguised face, by changing the color of their complexion, so as to imitate the complexion of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> they simulate, at one time under the guise of a man, at another under the guise of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, so as to deceive the people in their acting." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. ii) that "just as <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> by simulating other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> act the parts of those they are not (since he that acts the part of Agamemnon is not that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself but pretends to be), so too in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in every department of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, whoever wishes to seem what he is not is a hypocrite: for he pretends to be just without being so in reality."

<p>We must conclude, therefore, that hypocrisy is dissimulation, not, however, any form of dissimulation, but only when one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> simulates another, as when a sinner simulates the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sign of the intention. Accordingly when a man does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works pertaining by their genus to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seeks by their means to please, not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he simulates a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> which he has not. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (<a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>.) that "<a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> interests subservient to worldly purposes, since by making a show of saintly conduct they seek, not to turn men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to draw to themselves the applause of their approval:" and so they make a lying pretense of having a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, which they have not, although they do not pretend to do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> without doing it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, for instance the religious or the clerical <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, signifies a state whereby one is bound to perform works of perfection. And so when a man puts on the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of entering the state of perfection, if he fail through weakness, he is not a dissembler or a hypocrite, because he is not bound to disclose his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by laying aside the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. If, however, he were to put on the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in order to make a show of righteousness, he would be a hypocrite and a dissembler.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In dissimulation, as in a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, there are two things: one by way of sign, the other by way of thing signified. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in hypocrisy is considered as a thing signified, which does not tally with the sign: and the outward words, or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or any sensible objects are considered in every dissimulation and lie as a sign.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether hypocrisy is contrary to the virtue of truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that hypocrisy is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For in dissimulation or hypocrisy there is a sign and a thing signified. Now with regard to neither of these does it seem to be opposed to any special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for a hypocrite simulates any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and by means of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse1">Matthew 6:1-18</a>. Therefore hypocrisy is not specially opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all dissimulation seems to proceed from guile, wherefore it is opposed to simplicity. Now guile is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as above stated (55, 4). Therefore, hypocrisy which is dissimulation is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but rather to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or simplicity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of moral acts is taken from their end. Now the end of hypocrisy is the acquisition of gain or vainglory: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/job027.htm#verse8">Job 27:8</a>, "What is the hope of the hypocrite, if through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> he take by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>," says: "A hypocrite or, as the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> has it, a dissimulator, is a covetous <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>: for through desire of being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, though guilty of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, he steals praise for a life which is not his." [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> Moralia, Bk XVIII.] Therefore since <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or vainglory is not directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it seems that neither is hypocrisy or dissimulation.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All dissimulation is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore dissimulation or hypocrisy is also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. text. 13, 24, x), "contrariety is opposition as regards form," i.e. the specific form. Accordingly we must reply that dissimulation or hypocrisy may be opposed to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways, in one way directly, in another way indirectly. Its direct opposition or contrariety is to be considered with regard to the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the act, and this <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> depends on that act's proper object. Wherefore since hypocrisy is a kind of dissimulation, whereby a man simulates a character which is not his, as stated in the preceding article, it follows that it is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby a man shows himself in life and speech to be what he is, as stated in Ethic. iv, 7.

<p>The indirect opposition or contrariety of hypocrisy may be considered in relation to any <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, for instance a remote end, or an instrument of action, or anything else of that kind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The hypocrite in simulating a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regards it as his end, not in respect of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as though he wished to have it, but in respect of appearance, since he wishes to seem to have it. Hence his hypocrisy is not opposed to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as he wishes to deceive men with regard to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And he performs acts of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not as intending them for their own sake, but instrumentally, as signs of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherefore his hypocrisy has not, on that account, a direct opposition to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (55, 3,4,5), the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is cunning, to which it belongs to discover ways of achieving a purpose, that are apparent and not real: while it accomplishes that purpose, by guile in words, and by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: and it stands in relation to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as guile and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> to simplicity. Now guile and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> are directed chiefly to deception, and sometimes secondarily to injury. Wherefore it belongs directly to simplicity to guard oneself from deception, and in this way the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of simplicity is the same as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as stated above (109, 2, ad 4). There is, however, a mere <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference between them, because by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we mean the concordance between sign and thing signified, while simplicity indicates that one does not tend to different things, by intending one thing inwardly, and pretending another outwardly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Gain or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the remote end of the dissembler as also of the liar. Hence it does not take its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from this end, but from the proximate end, which is to show oneself other than one is. Wherefore it sometimes happens to a man to pretend great things of himself, for no further purpose than the mere <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of hypocrisy, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7), and as also we have said above with regard to lying (110, 2).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether hypocrisy is always a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that hypocrisy is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/isa016.htm#verse14">Isaiah 16:14</a>: "Of the two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> it is less to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> openly than to simulate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job 1:21</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/psa063.htm#verse7">Psalm 63:7</a>, "As it hath pleased the Lord," etc., says that "pretended <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>": and again a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse6">Lamentations 4:6</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> . . . of my people is made greater than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Sodom," says: "He deplores the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that falls into hypocrisy, which is a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Sodom." Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of Sodom are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore hypocrisy is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 8) that <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. But this is most grievous, for it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore a hypocrite always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one deserves the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and exclusion from seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save on account of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is deserved through hypocrisy according to <a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse13">Job 36:13</a>, "Dissemblers and crafty men <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": and the hypocrite is excluded from seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job013.htm#verse16">Job 13:16</a>, "No hypocrite shall come before His presence." Therefore hypocrisy is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hypocrisy is lying by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> since it is a kind of dissimulation. But it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to lie by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Neither therefore is all hypocrisy a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a hypocrite is to appear to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But this is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore hypocrisy is not of itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, hypocrisy is born of vainglory, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 17). But vainglory is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither therefore is hypocrisy.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are two things in hypocrisy, lack of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and simulation thereof. Accordingly if by a hypocrite we mean a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is directed to both the above, one, namely, who cares not to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> but only to appear so, in which sense <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a> is wont to use the term, it is evident that hypocrisy is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for no one is entirely deprived of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> save through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if by a hypocrite we mean one who intends to simulate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which he lacks through mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then, although he is in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby he is deprived of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, yet, in his case, the dissimulation itself is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This will depend on the end in view; for if this be contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of his neighbor, it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for instance if he were to simulate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in order to disseminate <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine, or that he may obtain ecclesiastical preferment, though unworthy, or that he may obtain any temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in which he fixes his end. If, however, the end intended be not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as for instance when a man takes pleasure in the pretense itself: of such a man it is said in Ethic. iv, 7 that "he would seem to be vain rather than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>"; for the same applies to simulation as to a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.

<p>It happens also sometimes that a man simulates the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare. Simulation of this kind is neither a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> always, nor is it always associated with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
