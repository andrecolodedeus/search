<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether an angel can enlighten man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot enlighten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iii) attributes enlightenment to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as "the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a>: "By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that not of yourselves, for it is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not enlightened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath manifested it to them" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes that "not only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> availed for the manifestation of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also revealed them by His work," that is, by His creature. But both are immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--that is, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and the creature. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enlightens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever is enlightened is conscious of being enlightened. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not conscious of being enlightened by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore he is not enlightened by them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv) that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of Divine things reaches men through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But such <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is an enlightenment as we have stated (106, 1; 107, 2). Therefore men are enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the order of Divine Providence disposes that lower things be subject to the actions of higher, as explained above (Question 109, Article 2); as the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are enlightened by the superior, so men, who are inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are enlightened by them.

<p>The modes of each of these kinds of enlightenment are in one way alike and in another way unlike. For, as was shown above (Question 106, Article 1), the enlightenment which consists in making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has two functions; namely, according as the inferior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is strengthened by the action of the superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and according as the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are in the superior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are proposed to the inferior so as to be grasped thereby. This takes place in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> when the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> divides his universal concept of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according to the capacity of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as explained above (Question 106, Article 1).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, however, cannot grasp the universal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself unveiled; because its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires it to understand by turning to the phantasms, as above explained (84, 7). So the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> propose the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> under the similitudes of sensible things, according to what <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i), that, "It is impossible for the divine ray to shine on us, otherwise than shrouded by the variety of the sacred veils." On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as the inferior, is strengthened by the action of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And in these two ways <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is enlightened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Two dispositions concur in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; first, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereby it is disposed to obey the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> tending to Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> assents to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not as convinced by the reason, but as commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, "No one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> except willingly." In this respect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires that what is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> be proposed to the believer; which is accomplished by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse17">Romans 10:17</a>, "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> cometh by hearing"; principally, however, by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by whom Divine things are revealed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have some part in the enlightenment of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover, men are enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not only concerning what is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; but also as regards what is to be done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Natural reason, which is immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can be strengthened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as we have said above. Again, the more the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is strengthened, so much higher an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be elicited from the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from creatures. Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is assisted by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> so that he may obtain from creatures a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> operation and enlightenment can be understood in two ways.

<p>First, on the part of the object understood; thus whoever understands or is enlightened, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he understands or is enlightened, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the object is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him.

<p>Secondly, on the part of the principle; and thus it does not follow that whoever understands a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is, which is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation. In like manner not everyone who is enlightened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is enlightened by him.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the angels can change the will of man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For, upon the text, "Who maketh His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits and His ministers a flame of fire" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse7">Hebrews 1:7</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> notes that "they are fire, as being spiritually fervent, and as burning away our <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>." This could not be, however, unless they changed the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (Super Matth. xv, 11), that, "the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not send <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts, but kindles them." <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a>, however, says that he also sends them; for he remarks that "every malicious act and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> passion is contrived by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and put into men" (De Fide Orth. ii, 4); in like manner also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> introduce and kindle <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thoughts. But this could only be if they changed the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is changed by them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as above explained, enlightens the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by means of the phantasms. But as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> which serves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be changed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so can the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which serves the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because it also is a faculty using a corporeal organ. Therefore as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so can he change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, according to <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs 21:1</a>: "The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord, whithersoever He will He shall turn it."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The will can be changed in two ways.

<p>First, from within; in which way, since the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is nothing but the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the thing willed, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can thus change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because He gives the power of such an inclination to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone Who gives the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, Who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved from without. As regards an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, this can be only in one way--by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence in as far as anyone may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why anything be apprehended as an appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so far does he move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. In this way also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> efficaciously; but an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by way of persuasion, as above explained (106, 2).

<p>In addition to this mode the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will can be moved from without in another way; namely, by the passion residing in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: thus by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined to will something. In this manner the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as being able to rouse these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, can move the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not however by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ever remains free to consent to, or to resist, the passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those who act as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers, either men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are said to burn away <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and to incite to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by way of persuasion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> cannot put thoughts in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> by <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> them from within, since the act of the cogitative faculty is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is called the kindler of thoughts, inasmuch as he incites to thought, by the desire of the things thought of, by way of persuasion, or by rousing the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> calls this kindling "a putting in" because such a work is accomplished within. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thoughts are attributed to a higher principle, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though they may be procured by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in its present state can understand only by turning to the phantasms; but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will can will something following the judgment of reason rather than the passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence the comparison does not hold.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angel can change man's imagination?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. For the phantasy, as is said De Anima iii, is "a motion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sense in act." But if this motion were <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, it would not be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the sense in act. Therefore it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the phantasy, which is the act of the imaginative faculty, to be changed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since the forms in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, they are nobler than the forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot impress forms upon sensible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (110, 2). Therefore he cannot impress forms on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and so he cannot change it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 12): "One spirit by intermingling with another can communicate his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the other spirit by these images, so that the latter either understands it himself, or accepts it as understood by the other." But it does not seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be mingled with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, nor that the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> can receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore it seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in the imaginative vision <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cleaves to the similitudes of the things as to the things themselves. But in this there is deception. So as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of deception, it seems that he cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the imaginative vision, by changing the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Those things which are seen in dreams are seen by imaginative vision. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> reveal things in dreams, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20</a>, <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse13">2:13-19</a> in regard to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> in dreams. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can move the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Both a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and a bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power can move the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. This may be explained as follows. For it was said above (Question 110, Article 3), that corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> obeys the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as regards local movement, so that whatever can be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the local movement of bodies is subject to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now it is manifest that imaginative apparitions are sometimes <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by the local movement of animal spirits and humors. Hence <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil.) [De Insomniis iii.], when assigning the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> in dreams, that "when an animal sleeps, the blood descends in abundance to the sensitive principle, and movements descend with it," that is, the impressions left from the movements are preserved in the animal spirits, "and move the sensitive principle"; so that a certain appearance ensues, as if the sensitive principle were being then changed by the external objects themselves. Indeed, the commotion of the spirits and humors may be so great that such appearances may even occur to those who are awake, as is seen in mad people, and the like. So, as this happens by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disturbance of the humors, and sometimes also by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> imagines what he previously experienced, so also the same may be done by the power of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or a bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, sometimes with alienation from the bodily senses, sometimes without such alienation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The first principle of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is from the sense in act. For we cannot <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> what we have never perceived by the senses, either wholly or partly; as a man born blind cannot <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> color. Sometimes, however, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is informed in such a way that the act of the imaginative movement arises from the impressions preserved within.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> changes the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, not indeed by the impression of an imaginative form in no way previously received from the senses (for he cannot make a man born blind <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> color), but by local movement of the spirits and humors, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The commingling of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> spirit with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is not a mingling of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>, but by reason of an effect which he produces in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> in the way above stated; so that he shows <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what he [the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but not in the way he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> an imaginative vision, sometimes enlightens the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> at the same time, so that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what these images signify; and then there is not deception. But sometimes by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> operation the similitudes of things only appear in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; but neither then is deception <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but by the defect in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to whom such things appear. Thus neither was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of deception when He spoke many things to the people in parables, which He did not explain to them.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether an angel can change the human senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> senses. For the sensitive operation is a vital operation. But such an operation does not come from an extrinsic principle. Therefore the sensitive operation cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the sensitive operation is nobler than the nutritive. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change the nutritive power, nor other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms. Therefore neither can he change the sensitive power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the senses are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> moved by the sensible objects. But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (110, 4). Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> cannot change the senses; but these are changed always by the sensible object.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who overturned Sodom, "struck the people of Sodom with blindness or <em>aorasia</em>, so that they could not find the door" (<a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse11">Genesis 19:11</a>). [It is worth noting that these are the only two passages in the Greek version where the word <em>aorasia</em> appears. It expresses, in fact, the effect produced on the people of Sodom--namely, dazzling (French version, "eblouissement"), which the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "caecitas" (blindness) does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> imply.] The same is recorded of the Syrians whom Eliseus led into Samaria (<a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse18">2 Kings 6:18</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The senses may be changed in a twofold manner; from without, as when affected by the sensible object: and from within, for we see that the senses are changed when the spirits and humors are disturbed; as for example, a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> tongue, charged with choleric humor, tastes everything as bitter, and the like with the other senses. Now an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, can work a change in the senses both ways. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can offer the senses a sensible object from without, formed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> himself, as when he assumes a body, as we have said above (Question 51, Article 2). Likewise he can move the spirits and humors from within, as above remarked, whereby the senses are changed in various ways.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The principle of the sensitive operation cannot be without the interior principle which is the sensitive power; but this interior principle can be moved in many ways by the exterior principle, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the interior movement of the spirits and humors an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can do something towards changing the act of the nutritive power, and also of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> and sensitive power, and of any other power using a corporeal organ.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can do nothing outside the entire order of creatures; but he can outside some particular order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since he is not subject to that order; thus in some special way an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can work a change in the senses outside the common mode of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
