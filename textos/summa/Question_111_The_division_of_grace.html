<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether grace is fittingly divided into sanctifying grace and gratuitous grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is clear from what has been already stated (110, 1). But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not therefore pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because something is given him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather on the contrary; since something is freely given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is pleasing to Him. Hence there is no <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is not given on account of preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> is given gratis. Now even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is presupposed to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself is given gratuitously by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore to be gratuitously given is not fittingly set down as a difference of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since it is found outside the genus of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, members of a division are mutually opposed. But even <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, whereby we are justified, is given to us gratuitously, according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24</a>: "Being justified freely [gratis] by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> ought not to be divided against gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> attributes both to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, viz. to sanctify and to be gratuitously given. For with regard to the first he says (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse6">Ephesians 1:6</a>): "He hath graced us in His beloved son." And with regard to the second (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse6">Romans 2:6</a>): "And if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not now by works, otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be distinguished by its having one only or both.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>), "those things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'those that are, are ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>]." Now the order of things consists in this, that things are led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by other things, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv). And hence since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to lead men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this takes place in a certain order, so that some are led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by others.

<p>And thus there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: one whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is called "<a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>"; the other is that whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cooperates with another in leading him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> is called "gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>," since it is bestowed on a man beyond the capability of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and beyond the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But whereas it is bestowed on a man, not to justify him, but rather that he may cooperate in the justification of another, it is not called <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. And it is of this that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>): "And the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto utility," i.e. of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is said to make pleasing, not efficiently but formally, i.e. because thereby a man is justified, and is made worthy to be called pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse21">Colossians 1:21</a>: "He hath made us worthy to be made partakers of the lot of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in light."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a>, inasmuch as it is gratuitously given, excludes the notion of debt. Now debt may be taken in two ways: first, as arising from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and this regards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose it is to do <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse4">Romans 4:4</a>: "Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but according to debt." The second debt regards the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus we say it is due to a man to have reason, and whatever else belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet in neither way is debt taken to mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to His creature, but rather that the creature ought to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the Divine ordination may be fulfilled in it, which is that a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should have certain <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> or properties, and that by doing certain works it should attain to something further. And hence <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments are not a debt in the first sense but in the second. But <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> gifts are due in neither sense. Hence they especially <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the name of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sanctifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> adds to the notion of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> something pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which does not do this keeps the common name, as happens in many other cases; and thus the two parts of the division are opposed as sanctifying and non-<a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether grace is fittingly divided into operating and cooperating grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into operating and cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, as stated above (Question 110, Article 2). Now no <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> can act upon its subject. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can be called operating.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> operates anything in us it assuredly brings about <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. But not only <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works this. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, on <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>, "the works that I do he also shall do," says (Serm. clxix): "He Who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thee without thyself, will not justify thee without thyself." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ought to be called simply operating.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to cooperate seems to pertain to the inferior agent, and not to the principal agent. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works in us more than <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a>: "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that sheweth mercy." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ought to be called cooperating.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, division ought to rest on opposition. But to operate and to cooperate are not opposed; for one and the same thing can both operate and cooperate. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into operating and cooperating.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Gratia et Lib. Arbit. xvii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by cooperating with us, perfects what He began by operating in us, since He who perfects by cooperation with such as are willing, beings by operating that they may will." But the operations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whereby He moves us to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertain to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is fittingly divided into operating and cooperating.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 110, Article 2) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be taken in two ways; first, as a Divine help, whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves us to will and to act; secondly, as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> divinely bestowed on us.

<p>Now in both these ways <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is fittingly divided into operating and cooperating. For the operation of an effect is not attributed to the thing moved but to the mover. Hence in that effect in which our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is moved and does not move, but in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the sole mover, the operation is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is with reference to this that we speak of "operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." But in that effect in which our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> both moves and is moved, the operation is not only attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and it is with reference to this that we speak of "cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>." Now there is a double act in us. First, there is the interior act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and with regard to this act the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a thing moved, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the mover; and especially when the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which hitherto willed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, begins to will <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And hence, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to this act, we speak of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But there is another, exterior act; and since it is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as was shown above (Question 17, Article 9) the operation of this act is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> assists us in this act, both by strengthening our will interiorly so as to attain to the act, and by granting outwardly the capability of operating, it is with respect to this that we speak of cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence after the aforesaid words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> subjoins: "He operates that we may will; and when we will, He cooperates that we may perfect." And thus if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is taken for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gratuitous motion whereby He moves us to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is fittingly divided into operating and cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>But if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is taken for the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, then again there is a double effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as of every other form; the first of which is "being," and the second, "operation"; thus the work of heat is to make its subject hot, and to give heat outwardly. And thus <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it heals and justifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or makes it pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is called operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but inasmuch as it is the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works, which spring from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, it is called cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a certain <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, it does not act upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> efficiently, but formally, as whiteness makes a surface white.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not justify us without ourselves, because whilst we are being justified we consent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> justification [justitiae] by a movement of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Nevertheless this movement is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but the effect; hence the whole operation pertains to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One thing is said to cooperate with another not merely when it is a secondary agent under a principal agent, but when it helps to the end intended. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to will the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, through the means of operating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And hence, the end being already intended, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cooperates with us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Operating and cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but are distinguished by their different effects, as is plain from what has been said.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether grace is fittingly divided into prevenient and subsequent grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into prevenient and subsequent. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an effect of the Divine love. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love is never subsequent, but always prevenient, according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse10">1 John 4:10</a>: "Not as though we had loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because He hath first loved us." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ought not to be divided into prevenient and subsequent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is but one <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since it is sufficient, according to <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>: "My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee." But the same thing cannot be before and after. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into prevenient and subsequent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its effects. Now there are an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of effects--one preceding another. Hence it with regard to these, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> must be divided into prevenient and subsequent, it would seem that there are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now no art takes note of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number. Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not fittingly divided into prevenient and subsequent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the outcome of His mercy. Now both are said in <a href="../bible/psa058.htm#verse11">Psalm 58:11</a>: "His mercy shall prevent me," and again, <a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse6">Psalm 22:6</a>: "Thy mercy will follow me." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is fittingly divided into prevenient and subsequent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is divided into operating and cooperating, with regard to its diverse effects, so also is it divided into prevenient and subsequent, howsoever we consider <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now there are five effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in us: of these, the first is, to heal the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the second, to desire <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the third, to carry into effect the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proposed; the fourth, to persevere in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the fifth, to reach <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the first effect in us, is called prevenient with respect to the second, and inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the second, it is called subsequent with respect to the first effect. And as one effect is posterior to this effect, and prior to that, so may <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be called prevenient and subsequent on account of the same effect viewed relatively to divers others. And this is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Natura et Gratia xxxi): "It is prevenient, inasmuch as it heals, and subsequent, inasmuch as, being healed, we are strengthened; it is prevenient, inasmuch as we are called, and subsequent, inasmuch as we are glorified."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love signifies something <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and hence can never be called anything but prevenient. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> signifies a temporal effect, which can precede and follow another; and thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be both prevenient and subsequent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The division into prevenient and subsequent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not divide <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but only in its effects, as was already said of operating and cooperating <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For subsequent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, inasmuch as it pertains to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, is not numerically distinct from prevenient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby we are at present justified. For even as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the earth is not voided in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, so must the same be said of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since the notion of neither implies imperfection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the effects of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, even as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, nevertheless all reduced to some of a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and moreover all coincide in this--that one precedes another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether gratuitous grace is rightly divided by the Apostle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not rightly divided by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> vouchsafed to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be called a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now there are an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> freely bestowed on us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as regards both the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body--and yet they do not make us pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> cannot be contained under any certain division.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, since we are justified by it, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans 5:1</a>: "Being justified therefore by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Hence it is not right to place <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> amongst the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, especially since the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not so placed, as hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the operation of healing, and speaking divers tongues are <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Again, the interpretation of speeches pertains either to wisdom or to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse17">Daniel 1:17</a>: "And to these children <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding in every book and wisdom." Hence it is not correct to divide the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing and kinds of tongues against the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and the interpretation of speeches against the word of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so also are understanding, counsel, piety, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and fear, as stated above (Question 68, Article 4). Therefore these also ought to be placed amongst the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 12:8-10</a>): "To one indeed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given the word of wisdom; and to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the same Spirit; to another, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another interpretation of speeches."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to this, viz. that a man may help another to be led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can help in this by moving interiorly (for this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone), but only exteriorly by teaching or persuading. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> embraces whatever a man needs in order to instruct another in Divine things which are above reason. Now for this three things are required: first, a man must possess the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things, so as to be capable of teaching others. Secondly, he must be able to confirm or <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what he says, otherwise his words would have no weight. Thirdly, he must be capable of fittingly presenting to his hearers what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<p>Now as regards the first, three things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as may be seen in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teaching. For whoever would teach another in any science must first be certain of the principles of the science, and with regard to this there is "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," which is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of invisible things, the principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine. Secondly, it behooves the teacher to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the principal conclusions of the science, and hence we have the word of "wisdom," which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things. Thirdly, he ought to abound with examples and a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of effects, whereby at times he needs to manifest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and thus we have the word of "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, since "the invisible things of Him . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>).

<p>Now the confirmation of such things as are within reason rests upon arguments; but the confirmation of what is above reason rests on what is proper to the Divine power, and this in two ways: first, when the teacher of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> does what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can do, in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whether with respect to bodily health--and thus there is the "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing," or merely for the purpose of manifesting the Divine power; for instance, that the sun should stand still or darken, or that the sea should be divided--and thus there is the "working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>." Secondly, when he can manifest what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and these are either future contingents--and thus there is "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>," or also the secrets of hearts--and thus there is the "discerning of spirits."

<p>But the capability of speaking can regard either the idiom in which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be understood, and thus there is "kinds of tongues"; or it can regard the sense of what is said, and thus there is the "interpretation of speeches."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), not all the benefits divinely conferred upon us are called gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but only those that surpass the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--e.g. that a fisherman should be replete with the word of wisdom and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the like; and such as these are here set down as gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is enumerated here under the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, not as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> justifying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in himself, but as implying a super-eminent <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby a man is fitted for instructing others concerning such things as belong to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. With regard to hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, they belong to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ordained thereby to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing is distinguished from the general working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> because it has a special reason for inducing one to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since a man is all the more ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when he has received the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of bodily health through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So, too, to speak with divers tongues and to interpret speeches have special efficacy in bestowing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence they are set down as special gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not numbered among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> in the same way as they are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, i.e. inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is rendered easily movable by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to the things of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for thus they are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (68, A1,4). But they are numbered amongst the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, inasmuch as they imply such a fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom that a man may not merely think aright of Divine things, but may instruct others and overpower adversaries. Hence it is significant that it is the "word" of wisdom and the "word" of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that are placed in the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1), "It is one thing merely to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what a man must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to reach everlasting life, and another thing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how this may benefit the godly and may be defended against the ungodly."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether gratuitous grace is nobler than sanctifying grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. For "the people's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is better than the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 2). Now <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> alone, whereas gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as stated above (1,4). Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is a greater power that is able to act upon another, than that which is confined to itself, even as greater is the brightness of the body that can illuminate other bodies, than of that which can only shine but cannot illuminate; and hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1) "that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," since by it a man bears himself rightly towards others. But by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> a man is perfected only in himself; whereas by gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man works for the perfection of others. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is proper to the best is nobler than what is common to all; thus to reason, which is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is nobler than to feel, which is common to all animals. Now <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is common to all members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the proper <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the more exalted members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is nobler than <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>), having enumerated the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> adds: "And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way"; and as the sequel proves he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is more noble than gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The higher the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is ordained, the more excellent is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the end is always greater than the means. But <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> ordains a man immediately to a union with his last end, whereas gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ordains a man to what is preparatory to the end; i.e. by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and so forth, men are induced to unite themselves to their last end. And hence <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is nobler than gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. xii, text. 52), a multitude, as an army, has a double <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the first is in the multitude itself, viz. the order of the army; the second is separate from the multitude, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the leader--and this is better <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since the other is ordained to it. Now gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is ordained to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is ecclesiastical order, whereas <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is ordained to the separate common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is the nobler.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> could <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a man to have <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, it would follow that the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was the nobler; even as the brightness of the sun that enlightens is more excellent than that of an object that is lit up. But by gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> another to have union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he himself has by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>; but he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> certain dispositions towards it. Hence gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needs not to be the more excellent, even as in fire, the heat, which manifests its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> whereby it produces heat in other things, is not more noble than its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Feeling is ordained to reason, as to an end; and thus, to reason is nobler. But here it is the contrary; for what is proper is ordained to what is common as to an end. Hence there is no comparison.
