<h1>Question 112. Boasting</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3112.htm#article1"> To which virtue is it opposed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3112.htm#article2"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether boasting is opposed to the virtue of truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that boasting is not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For lying is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But it is possible to boast even without lying, as when a man makes a show of his own excellence. Thus it is written (<a href="../bible/est001.htm#verse3">Esther 1:3-4</a>) that Assuerus "made a great feast . . . that he might show the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" and "of his kingdom, and the greatness and boasting of his power." Therefore boasting is not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, boasting is reckoned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxiii, 4) to be one of the four <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, "when," to wit, "a man boasts of having what he has not." Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jer048.htm#verse29">Jeremiah 48:29-30</a>): "We have heard the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the loftiness of his heart. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it." Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 7) that boasting arises from vainglory. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Therefore boasting is opposed, not to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, boasting seems to be occasioned by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse8">Wisdom 5:8</a>): "What hath <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us? or what advantage hath the boasting of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> brought us?" Now excess of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> seems to belong to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or liberality. Therefore boasting is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 7), that boasting is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> "Jactantia" [boasting] seems properly to denote the uplifting of self by words: since if a man wishes to throw [jactare] a thing far away, he lifts it up high. And to uplift oneself, properly speaking, is to talk of oneself above oneself [Or 'tall-talking' as we should say in English]. This happens in two ways. For sometimes a man speaks of himself, not above what he is in himself, but above that which he is esteemed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be: and this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declines to do when he says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 12:6</a>): "I forbear lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or anything he heareth of me." On another way a man uplifts himself in words, by speaking of himself above that which he is in reality. And since we should judge of things as they are in themselves, rather than as others deem them to be, it follows that boasting denotes more properly the uplifting of self above what one is in oneself, than the uplifting of self above what others think of one: although in either case it may be called boasting. Hence boasting properly so called is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by way of excess.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes boasting as exceeding men's opinion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of boasting may be considered in two ways. First, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the act, and thus it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as stated (in the body of the article and110, 2). Secondly, with regard to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from which more frequently though not always it arises: and thus it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as its inwardly moving and impelling <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For when a man is uplifted inwardly by arrogance, it often results that outwardly he boasts of great things about himself; though sometimes a man takes to boasting, not from arrogance, but from some kind of vanity, and delights therein, because he is a boaster by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Hence arrogance, which is an uplifting of self above oneself, is a kind of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; yet it is not the same as boasting, but is very often its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> reckons boasting among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Moreover, the boaster frequently aims at obtaining <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through his boasting, and so, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, it arises from vainglory considered as its end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Wealth also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> boasting, in two ways. First, as an occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, inasmuch as a man prides himself on his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Hence (<a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse18">Proverbs 8:18</a>) "<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>" are significantly described as "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>']. Secondly, as being the end of boasting, since according to Ethic. iv, 7, some boast, not only for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but also for the sake of gain. Such people invent stories about themselves, so as to make profit thereby; for instance, they pretend to be skilled in medicine, wisdom, or <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether boasting is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that boasting is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse25">Proverbs 28:25</a>): "He that boasteth, and puffeth himself, stirreth up quarrels." Now it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to stir up quarrels, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> those that sow discord, according to <a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse19">Proverbs 6:19</a>. Therefore boasting is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is forbidden in <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse2">Sirach 6:2</a>, "Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," says: "This is a prohibition of boasting and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." Therefore boasting is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, boasting is a kind of lie. But it is neither an officious nor a jocose lie. This is evident from the end of lying; for according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7), "the boaster pretends to something greater than he is, sometimes for no further purpose, sometimes for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, sometimes for the sake of money." Thus it is evident that it is neither an officious nor a jocose lie, and consequently it must be a mischievous lie. Therefore seemingly it is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Boasting arises from vainglory, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17). Now vainglory is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which only the very perfect avoid. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. viii, 30) that "it belongs to the very perfect, by outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> so to seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their author, that they are not inwardly uplifted by the praise awarded them." Therefore boasting is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 110, Article 4), a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Accordingly boasting may be considered in two ways. First, in itself, as a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and thus it is sometimes a mortal, and sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when a man boasts of that which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>--thus it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the king of Tyre (<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 28:2</a>): "Thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said: I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"--or contrary to the love of our neighbor, as when a man while boasting of himself breaks out into invectives against others, as told of the Pharisee who said (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse11">Luke 18:11</a>): "I am not as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, extortioners, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>, as also is this publican." Sometimes it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when, to wit, a man boasts of things that are against neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor his neighbor. Secondly, it may be considered with regard to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or the desire of gain or of vainglory: and then if it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or from such vainglory as is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then the boasting will also be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: otherwise it will be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Sometimes, however, a man breaks out into boasting through desire of gain, and for this very reason he would seem to be aiming at the deception and injury of his neighbor: wherefore boasting of this kind is more likely to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "a man who boasts for the sake of gain, is viler than one who boasts for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Yet it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because the gain may be such as not to injure another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To boast in order to stir quarrels is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it happens sometimes that boasts are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of quarrels, not intentionally but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: and consequently boasting will not be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on that account.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of boasting as arising from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Boasting does not always involve a mischievous lie, but only where it is contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or our neighbor, either in itself or in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. That a man boast, through mere pleasure in boasting, is an inane thing to do, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. iv, 7): wherefore it amounts to a jocose lie. Unless perchance he were to prefer this to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to contemn <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments for the sake of boasting: for then it would be against the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom alone ought our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to rest as in its last end.

<p>To boast for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or gain seen to involve an officious lie: provided it be do without injury to others, for then it would once become a mischievous lie.
