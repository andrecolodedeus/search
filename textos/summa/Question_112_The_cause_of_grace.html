<h1>Question 112. The cause of grace</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/2112.htm#article1"> Is God alone the efficient cause of grace?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2112.htm#article2"> Is any disposition towards grace needed on the part of the recipient, by an act of free-will?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2112.htm#article3"> Can such a disposition make grace follow of necessity?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2112.htm#article4"> Is grace equal in all?</a> <li><a href="../summa/2112.htm#article5"> May anyone know that he has grace?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether God alone is the cause of grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Now, by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is understood not merely the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> assuming, but the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed. Therefore a creature may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is this difference between the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> and those of the Old, that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> merely signify it. Now the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> are certain visible elements. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iii, iv, vii, viii), "Angels cleanse, enlighten, and perfect both lesser <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men." Now the rational creature is cleansed, enlightened, and perfected by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa083.htm#verse12">Psalm 83:12</a>): "The Lord will give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing can act beyond its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must always be more powerful than its effect. Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> surpasses every capability of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is nothing short of a partaking of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which exceeds every other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And thus it is impossible that any creature should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone should deify, bestowing a partaking of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> by a participated likeness, as it is impossible that anything save fire should enkindle.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity is an "organ of His Godhead," as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 19). Now an instrument does not bring forth the action of the principal agent by its own power, but in virtue of the principal agent. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by its own power, but by virtue of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> joined to it, whereby the actions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity are saving actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the humanity <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the Divine power being the principal agent, so likewise in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, which are derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is instrumentally <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and principally by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> working in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a>: "Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Angels cleanse, enlighten, and perfect <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, by instruction, and not by justifying them through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii) that "this cleansing and enlightenment and perfecting is nothing else than the assumption of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any preparation and disposition for grace is required on man's part?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no preparation or disposition for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part, since, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse4">Romans 4:4</a>), "To him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but according to debt." Now a man's preparation by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> can only be through some operation. Hence it would do away with the notion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever is going on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, is not preparing himself to have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But to some who are going on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given, as is clear in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whilst he was "breathing our threatenings and slaughter against the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse1">Acts 9:1</a>). Hence no preparation for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power needs no disposition in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since it does not even require <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as appears in creation, to which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is compared, which is called "a new creature" (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse15">Galatians 6:15</a>). But only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Hence no preparation is required on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part to obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse12">Amos 4:12</a>): "Be prepared to meet thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>," and (<a href="../bible/1sa007.htm#verse3">1 Samuel 7:3</a>): "Prepare your hearts unto the Lord."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 111, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is taken in two ways: first, as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Secondly, as a help from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now taking <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the first sense, a certain preparation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required for it, since a form can only be in disposed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as it signifies a help from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to move us to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, no preparation is required on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part, that, as it were, anticipates the Divine help, but rather, every preparation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must be by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And thus even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, whereby anyone is prepared for receiving the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to prepare himself, according to <a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse1">Proverbs 16:1</a>: "It is the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to prepare the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; yet it is principally from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who moves the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Hence it is said that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> steps are guided by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A certain preparation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is simultaneous with the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and this operation is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, not indeed of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is already possessed--but of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is not yet possessed. But there is another imperfect preparation, which sometimes precedes the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, and yet it is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> motion. But it does not suffice for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not yet justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> can only arise from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as will be seen further on (114, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since a man cannot prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prevent and move him to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is of no account whether anyone arrive at perfect preparation instantaneously, or step by step. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse23">Sirach 11:23</a>): "It is easy in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on a sudden to make the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rich." Now it sometimes happens that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves a man to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this preparation precedes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But He sometimes moves him suddenly and perfectly to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> suddenly, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>: "Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to Me." And thus it happened to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, since, suddenly when he was in the midst of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his heart was perfectly moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to hear, to learn, to come; and hence he received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> suddenly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power needs no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, brought about by the action of something else; and yet, looking to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, it must <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in the thing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the due disposition for the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. So likewise, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infuses <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> into a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, no preparation is required which He Himself does not bring about.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether grace is necessarily given to whoever prepares himself for it, or to whoever does what he can?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> given to whoever prepares himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or to whoever does what he can, because, on <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans 5:1</a>, "Being justified . . . by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let us have peace," etc. the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> welcomes whoever flies to Him, otherwise there would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> with Him." But it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not to welcome whoever flies to Him. Hence he receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Casu Diaboli. iii) that the reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not bestow <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, is that he did not wish, nor was he prepared, to receive it. But if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be removed, the effect must needs be removed also. Therefore, if anyone is willing to receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> it is bestowed on them of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is diffusive of itself, as appears from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is better than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forms <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> come to disposed <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, much more does it seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> bestowed on whoever prepares himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as clay to the potter, according to <a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 18:6</a>: "As clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in My hand." But however much the clay is prepared, it does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> receive its shape from the potter. Hence, however much a man prepares himself, he does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> preparation for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Mover, and from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as moved. Hence the preparation may be looked at in two ways: first, as it is from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and thus there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that it should obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> exceeds every preparation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power. But it may be considered, secondly, as it is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Mover, and thus it has a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>--not indeed of coercion, but of infallibility--as regards what it is ordained to by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot fail, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his book on the Predestination of the Saints (De Dono Persev. xiv) that "by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> whoever is liberated, is most certainly liberated." Hence if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intends, while moving, that the one whose heart He moves should attain to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he will infallibly attain to it, according to <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>: "Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is speaking of such as fly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, already "informed" with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for if they did not receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would be against the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which He Himself established. Or if it refers to the movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> before <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is speaking in the sense that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> flight to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by a Divine motion, which ought not, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to fail.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the defect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is on our part; but the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> according to <a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse9">Hosea 13:9</a>: "Destruction is thy own, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; thy help is only in Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, the form does not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> ensue the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, except by the power of the agent that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the disposition.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether grace is greater in one than in another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not greater in one than in another. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in us by the Divine love, as stated above (Question 110, Article 1). Now it is written (<a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse8">Wisdom 6:8</a>): "He made the little and the great and He hath equally care of all." Therefore all obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from Him equally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is the greatest possible, cannot be more or less. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the greatest possible, since it joins us with our last end. Therefore there is no greater or less in it. Hence it is not greater in one than in another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> life, as stated above (110, 1, ad 2). But there is no greater or less in life. Hence, neither is there in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians 4:7</a>): "But to every one of us is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of the giving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now what is given in measure, is not given to all equally. Hence all have not an equal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (52, A1,2; 56, A1,2), <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> can have a double magnitude: one, as regards the end or object, as when a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be more noble through being ordained to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; the other on the part of the subject, which more or less participates in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> inhering to it.

<p>Now as regards the first magnitude, <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> cannot be greater or less, since, of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> joins <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the Highest Good, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as regards the subject, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can receive more or less, inasmuch as one may be more perfectly enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than another. And a certain reason for this is on the part of him who prepares himself for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since he who is better prepared for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, receives more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Yet it is not here that we must seek the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this diversity, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prepares himself, only inasmuch as his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this diversity is to be sought on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who dispenses His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> variously, in order that the beauty and perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may result from these various degree; even as He instituted the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of things, that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> might be perfect. Hence after the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> had said (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians 4:7</a>): "To every one of us is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to the measure of the giving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," having enumerated the various <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, he adds (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse12">Ephesians 4:12</a>): "For the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> . . . for the edifying of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Divine care may be looked at in two ways: first, as regards the Divine act, which is simple and uniform; and thus His care looks equally to all, since by one simple act He administers great things and little. But, "secondly," it may be considered in those things which come to be considered by the Divine care; and thus, inequality is found, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His care provides greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> to some, and lesser <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> for others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection is based on the first kind of magnitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot be greater by ordaining to a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but inasmuch as it more or less ordains to a greater or less participation of the same <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For there may be diversity of intensity and remissness, both in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and in final <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as regards the subjects' participation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural life pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and hence cannot be more or less; but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> partakes of the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, and hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may possess it more or less.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether man can know that he has grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by its physical reality is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has most certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those things that are in it by their physical reality, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 31). Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> most certainly by one who has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But whoever receives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse17">Wisdom 7:17</a>: The Lord "hath given me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things that are." Hence, with equal reason, whoever receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, light is more knowable than darkness, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse13">Ephesians 5:13</a>), "all that is made manifest is light," Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> darkness, may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by one that is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much more, therefore, may <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light, be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>): "Now we have received not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of this world, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> first <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Hence, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who receives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given to him.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it was said by the Lord to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse12">Genesis 22:12</a>): "Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou fearest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," i.e. "I have made thee <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>." Now He is speaking there of chaste fear, which is not apart from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence a man may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>): "Man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not whether he be worthy of love or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> maketh a man worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love. Therefore no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether he has <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are three ways of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing: first, by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and thus anyone may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a special privilege reveals this at times to some, in order that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of safety may begin in them even in this life, and that they may carry on toilsome works with greater trust and greater energy, and may bear the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this present life, as when it was said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee."

<p>Secondly, a man may, of himself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something, and with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>; and in this way no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> about a thing can only be had when we may judge of it by its proper principle. Thus it is by undemonstrable universal principles that <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> is obtained concerning demonstrative conclusions. Now no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he has the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a conclusion if he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its principle. But the principle of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and its object is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who by reason of His very excellence is unknown to us, according to <a href="../bible/job036.htm#verse26">Job 36:26</a>: "Behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great, exceeding our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." And hence His presence in us and His absence cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse11">Job 9:11</a>: "If He come to me, I shall not see Him; if He depart I shall not understand." And hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot judge with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 4:3-4</a>: "But neither do I judge my own self . . . but He that judgeth me is the Lord."

<p>Thirdly, things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> conjecturally by signs; and thus anyone may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, when he is conscious of delighting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of despising worldly things, and inasmuch as a man is not conscious of any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And thus it is written (<a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse17">Apocalypse 2:17</a>): "To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna . . . which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, but he that receiveth it," because whoever receives it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, by experiencing a certain sweetness, which he who does not receive it, does not experience. Yet this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is imperfect; hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>): "I am not conscious to myself of anything, yet am I not hereby justified," since, according to <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse13">Psalm 18:13</a>: "Who can understand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? From my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord, and from those of others spare Thy servant."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those things which are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their physical reality, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; in so far as through acts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has experience of their inward principles: thus when we wish, we perceive that we have a will; and when we exercise the functions of life, we observe that there is life in us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that a man should have <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and again, it is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that a man should be certain of the things of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this, because <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherein these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>. Hence, whoever has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he has them. But it is otherwise with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and such like, which perfect the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sin has for its principal object commutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. But the object or end of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is unknown to us on account of the greatness of its light, according to <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1 Timothy 6:16</a>: "Who . . . inhabiteth light inaccessible."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is here speaking of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which have been given to us in hope, and these we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most certainly by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, although we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that we have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to enable us to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> them. Or it may be said that he is speaking of the privileged <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which comes of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Hence he adds (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>): "But to us <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath revealed them by His Spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> What was said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> may refer to experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which springs from <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of which we are cognizant. For in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had just wrought, he could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> experimentally that he had the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or it may refer to a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.
