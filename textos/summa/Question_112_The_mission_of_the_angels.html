<h1>Question 112. The mission of the angels</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1112.htm#article1"> Are any angels sent on works of ministry?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1112.htm#article2"> Are all sent?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1112.htm#article3"> Do those who are sent, assist?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1112.htm#article4"> From what orders are they sent?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the angels are sent on works of ministry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not sent on works of ministry. For every mission is to some determinate place. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> actions do not determine a place, for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts from the "here" and "now." Since therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> actions are <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, it appears that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not sent to perform their own actions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the place that beseems the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> dignity. Therefore if they are sent to us in ministry, it seems that something of their dignity would be lost; which is unseemly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, external occupation hinders the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom; hence it is said: "He that is less in action, shall receive wisdom" (<a href="../bible/sir038.htm#verse25">Sirach 38:25</a>). So if some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are sent on external ministrations, they would seemingly be hindered from <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. But the whole of their beatitude consists in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So if they were sent, their beatitude would be lessened; which is unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, to minister is the part of an inferior; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse27">Luke 22:27</a>): "Which is the greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table?" But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> greater than we are. Therefore they are not sent to administer to us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse20">Exodus 23:20</a>): "Behold I will send My <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who shall go before thee."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> From what has been said above (Question 108, Article 6), it may be shown that some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are sent in ministry by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, as we have already stated (43, 1), in treating of the mission of the Divine Persons, he is said to be sent who in any way proceeds from another so as to begin to be where he was not, or to be in another way, where he already was. Thus the Son, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be sent as proceeding from the Father by origin; and begins to be in a new way, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed, where He was before by the presence of His Godhead; for it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be present everywhere, because, since He is the universal agent, His power reaches to all being, and hence He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in all things (8, 1). An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power, however, as a particular agent, does not reach to the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but reaches to one thing in such a way as not to reach another; and so he is "here" in such a manner as not to be "there." But it is clear from what was above stated (110, 1), that the corporeal creature is governed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hence, whenever an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has to perform any work concerning a corporeal creature, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> applies himself anew to that body by his power; and in that way begins to be there afresh. Now all this takes place by Divine command. Hence it follows that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Yet the action performed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who is sent, proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as from its first principle, at Whose nod and by Whose authority the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> work; and is reduced to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to its last end. Now this is what is meant by a minister: for a minister is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> instrument; while an instrument is moved by another, and its action is ordered to another. Hence <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' actions are called 'ministries'; and for this reason they are said to be sent in ministry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An operation can be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> in two ways. In one way, as dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, as <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; such an operation does not demand to occupy a place; indeed, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iv, 20): "Even we ourselves as <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mentally</a> tasting something <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, are not in this world." In another sense an action is said to be <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> because it is regulated and commanded by some <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; in that sense the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operations evidently have sometimes a determinate place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> dignity by way of congruity; forasmuch as it is congruous that the higher body should be attributed to that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which occupies a rank above bodies. Yet an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> does not derive his dignity from the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; so when he is not actually in the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nothing of his dignity is lost, as neither does a king lessen his dignity when not actually sitting on his regal throne, which suits his dignity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In ourselves the purity of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is obscured by exterior occupation; because we give ourselves to action through the sensitive faculties, the action of which when intense impedes the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, on the contrary, regulates his exterior actions by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation alone. Hence it follows that his external occupations in no respect impede his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; because given two actions, one of which is the rule and the reason of the other, one does not hinder but helps the other. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii) that "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not go abroad in such a manner as to lose the delights of inward <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In their external actions the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> chiefly minister to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and secondarily to us; not because we are superior to them, absolutely speaking, but because, since every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by cleaving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made one spirit with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is thereby superior to every creature. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>): "Esteeming others better than themselves."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether all the angels are sent in ministry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are sent in ministry. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>): "All are ministering spirits, sent to minister" [Vulg. 'Are they not all . . .?'].

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, among the orders, the highest is that of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a>, as stated above (Question 108, Article 6). But a Seraph was sent to purify the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>). Therefore much more are the inferior orders sent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Divine Persons <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> excel all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders. But the Divine Persons are sent. Therefore much more are even the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> sent.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not sent to the external ministries, this can only be because the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> execute the Divine ministries by means of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But as all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are unequal, as stated above (Question 50, Article 4), each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> inferior to himself except the last one. Therefore only the last <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would be sent in ministry; which contradicts the words, "Thousands of thousands ministered to Him" (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), quoting the statement of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. xiii), that "the higher ranks fulfil no exterior service."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears from what has been said above (106, 3; 110, 1), the order of Divine Providence has so disposed not only among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but also in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, that inferior things are administered by the superior. But the Divine dispensation, however, this order is sometimes departed from as regards corporeal things, for the sake of a higher order, that is, according as it is suitable for the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind was enlightened, that <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was raised from the dead, was accomplished immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without the action of the heavenly bodies. Moreover both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can work some effect in these bodies independently of the heavenly bodies, by the condensation of the clouds to rain, and by producing some such effects. Nor can anyone <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can immediately reveal things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> without the help of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> without the inferior. From this standpoint some have said that according to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not sent, but only the inferior; yet that sometimes, by Divine dispensation, the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also are sent.

<p>It may also be said that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> wishes to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who were chosen as the messengers of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; in order that He might show the excellence of the new over the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence there is no need to apply this to any other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> besides those who were sent to give the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. xiii), the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who was sent to purify the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s lips was one of the inferior order; but was called a "Seraph," that is, "kindling " in an equivocal sense, because he came to "kindle" the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. It may also be said that the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> communicate their own proper <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> whereby they are denominated, through the ministry of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus one of the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> is described as purifying by fire the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s lips, not as if he did so immediately, but because an inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> did so by his power; as the Pope is said to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> a man when he gives <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> by means of someone else.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry, but are said to be sent in an equivocal sense, as appears from what has been said (43, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A manifold grade <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the Divine ministries. Hence there is nothing to prevent <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> though unequal from being sent immediately in ministry, in such a manner however that the superior are sent to the higher ministries, and the lower to the inferior ministries.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all the angels who are sent, assist?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sent also assist. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "So the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are sent, and assist; for, though the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> spirit is limited, yet the supreme Spirit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not limited."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was sent to administer to <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a>. Yet he said, "I am the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Raphael, one of the seven who stand before the Lord" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse15">Tobit 12:15</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sent, assist.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than Satan is. Yet Satan assisted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse6">Job 1:6</a>: "When the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them." Therefore much more do the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are sent to minister, assist.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not assist, the reason is because they receive the Divine enlightenment, not immediately, but through the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But every <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> receives the Divine enlightenment from a superior, except the one who is highest of all. Therefore only the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would assist; which is contrary to the text of <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>: "Ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before Him." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sent also assist.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says, on <a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse3">Job 25:3</a>: "Is there any numbering of His soldiers?" (Moral. xvii): "Those powers assist, who do not go forth as messengers to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Therefore those who are sent in ministry do not assist.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are spoken of as "assisting" and "administering," after the likeness of those who attend upon a king; some of whom ever wait upon him, and hear his commands immediately; while others there are to whom the royal commands are conveyed by those who are in attendance--for instance, those who are placed at the head of the administration of various cities; these are said to administer, not to assist.

<p>We must therefore observe that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> gaze upon the Divine Essence immediately; in regard to which all, even those who minister, are said to assist. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii) that "those who are sent on the external ministry of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> can always assist and see the face of the Father." Yet not all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can perceive the secrets of the Divine mysteries in the clearness itself of the Divine Essence; but only the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who announce them to the inferior: and in that respect only the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belonging to the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are said to assist, whose special prerogative it is to be enlightened immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>From this may be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> the reply to the first and second objections, which are based on the first mode of assisting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Satan is not described as having assisted, but as present among the assistants; for, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. ii), "though he has lost beatitude, still he has retained a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> like to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All the assistants see some things immediately in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine Essence; and so it may be said that it is the prerogative of the whole of the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to be immediately enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while the higher ones among them see more than is seen by the inferior; some of whom enlighten others: as also among those who assist the king, one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more of the king's secrets than another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all the angels of the second hierarchy are sent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are sent. For all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> either assist, or minister, according to <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> do not assist; for they are enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. viii). Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are sent in ministry.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xvii) that "there are more who minister than who assist." This would not be the case if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> were not sent in ministry. Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are sent to minister.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the "Dominations are above all subjection." But to be sent implies subjection. Therefore the dominations are not sent to minister.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (1), to be sent to external ministry properly belongs to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> according as he acts by Divine command in respect of any corporeal creature; which is part of the execution of the Divine ministry. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> properties are manifested by their names, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii); and therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of those orders are sent to external ministry whose names signify some kind of administration. But the name "dominations" does not signify any such administration, but only disposition and command in administering. On the other hand, the names of the inferior orders imply administration, for the "Angels" and "Archangels" are so called from "announcing"; the "Virtues" and "Powers" are so called in respect of some act; and it is right that the "Prince," according to what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), "be first among the workers." Hence it belongs to these five orders to be sent to external ministry; not to the four superior orders.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Dominations are reckoned among the ministering <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not as exercising but as disposing and commanding what is to be done by others; thus an architect does not put his hands to the production of his art, but only disposes and orders what others are to do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A twofold reason may be given in assigning the number of the assisting and ministering <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says that those who minister are more numerous than those who assist; because he takes the words (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel 7:10</a>) "thousands of thousands ministered to Him," not in a multiple but in a partitive sense, to mean "thousands out of thousands"; thus the number of those who minister is indefinite, and signifies excess; while the number of assistants is finite as in the words added, "and ten thousand times a hundred thousand assisted Him." This explanation rests on the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, who said that the nearer things are to the one first principle, the smaller they are in number; as the nearer a number is to unity, the lesser it is than multitude. This opinion is verified as regards the number of orders, as six administer and three assist.

<p><a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a>, however, (Coel. Hier. xiv) declares that the multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> surpasses all the multitude of material things; so that, as the superior bodies exceed the inferior in magnitude to an immeasurable degree, so the superior incorporeal natures surpass all corporeal natures in multitude; because whatever is better is more intended and more multiplied by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence, as the assistants are superior to the ministers there will be more assistants than ministers. In this way, the words "thousands of thousands" are taken by way of multiplication, to signify "a thousand times a thousand." And because ten times a hundred is a thousand, if it were said "ten times a hundred thousand" it would mean that there are as many assistants as ministers: but since it is written "ten thousand times a hundred thousand," we are given to understand that the assistants are much more numerous than the ministers. Nor is this said to signify that this is the precise number of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but rather that it is much greater, in that it exceeds all material multitude. This is signified by the multiplication together of all the greatest numbers, namely ten, a hundred, and a thousand, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> remarks in the same passage.
