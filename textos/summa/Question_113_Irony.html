<h1>Question 113. Irony</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3113.htm#article1"> Is irony a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3113.htm#article2"> Its comparison with boasting</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether irony is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that irony, which consists in belittling oneself, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arises from one's being strengthened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and yet this leads one to belittle oneself, according to <a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse1">Proverbs 30:1-2</a>: "The vision which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke, with whom is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who being strengthened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abiding with him, said, I am the most foolish of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Also it is written (<a href="../bible/amo007.htm#verse14">Amos 7:14</a>): "Amos answered . . . I am not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>." Therefore irony, whereby a man belittles himself in words, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a letter to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the English (Regist. xii): "It is the mark of a well-disposed mind to acknowledge one's fault when one is not guilty." But all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is inconsistent with a well-disposed mind. Therefore irony is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to shun <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. But "some belittle themselves in words, so as to avoid <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7). Therefore irony is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Apost., Serm. xxix): "If thou liest on account of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, if thou wert not a sinner before lying, thou hast become one by lying."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To speak so as to belittle oneself may occur in two ways. First so as to safeguard <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as when a man conceals the greater things in himself, but discovers and asserts lesser things of himself the presence of which in himself he perceives. To belittle oneself in this way does not belong to irony, nor is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of its genus, except through corruption of one of its circumstances. Secondly, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> belittles himself by forsaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for instance by ascribing to himself something mean the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of which in himself he does not perceive, or by denying something great of himself, which nevertheless he perceives himself to possess: this pertains to irony, and is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is a twofold wisdom and a twofold folly. For there is a wisdom according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or worldly folly annexed to it, according to <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise." But there is another wisdom that is worldly, which as the same text goes on to say, "is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Accordingly, he that is strengthened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acknowledges himself to be most foolish in the estimation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because, to wit, he despises <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom seeks. Hence the text quoted continues, "and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is not with me," and farther on, "and I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the science of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the science of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>'].

<p>It may also be replied that "the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" is that which is acquired by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, while the "wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>" is that which is received by divine inspiration. Amos denied that he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> by birth, since, to wit, he was not of the race of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: hence the text goes on, "nor am I the son of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to a well-disposed mind that a man tend to perfect righteousness, and consequently deem himself guilty, not only if he fall short of common righteousness, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also if he fall short of perfect righteousness, which sometimes is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But he does not call <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> that which he does not acknowledge to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>: which would be a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> of irony.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not commit one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order to avoid another: and so he ought not to lie in any way at all in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xliii in Joan.): "Shun not arrogance so as to forsake <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxvi, 3) that "it is a reckless <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> that entangles itself with lies."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether irony is a less grievous sin than boasting?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that irony is not a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than boasting. For each of them is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through forsaking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is a kind of equality. But one does not forsake <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by exceeding it any more than by diminishing it. Therefore irony is not a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than boasting.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 7), irony sometimes is boasting. But boasting is not irony. Therefore irony is not a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than boasting.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse25">Proverbs 26:25</a>): "When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart." Now it belongs to irony to speak low. Therefore it contains a manifold <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7): "Those who speak with irony and belittle themselves are more gracious, seemingly, in their manners."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (110, 2,4), one lie is more grievous than another, sometimes on account of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which it is about--thus a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> about a matter of religious doctrine is most grievous--and sometimes on account of the motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>; thus a mischievous lie is more grievous than an officious or jocose lie. Now irony and boasting lie about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, either by words, or by any other outward signs, namely, about matters affecting the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: so that in this respect they are equal.

<p>But for the most part boasting proceeds from a viler motive, namely, the desire of gain or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: whereas irony arises from a man's averseness, albeit inordinate, to be disagreeable to others by uplifting himself: and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "boasting is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than irony."

<p>Sometimes, however, it happens that a man belittles himself for some other motive, for instance that he may deceive cunningly: and then irony is more grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument applies to irony and boasting, according as a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is considered to be grievous in itself or on account of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for it has been said that in this way they are equal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Excellence is twofold: one is in temporal, the other in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. Now it happens at times that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by outward words or signs, pretends to be lacking in external things, for instance by wearing shabby clothes, or by doing something of the kind, and that he intends by so doing to make a show of some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> excellence. Thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said of certain men (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse16">Matthew 6:16</a>) that "they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast." Wherefore such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are guilty of both <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, irony and boasting, although in different respects, and for this reason they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievously. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that it is "the practice of boasters both to make overmuch of themselves, and to make very little of themselves": and for the same reason it is related of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> that he was unwilling to possess clothes that were either too costly or too shabby, because by both do men seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the words of <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse23">Sirach 19:23</a>, "There is one that humbleth himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit," and it is in this sense that Solomon speaks of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, through deceitful <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, "speaks low" wickedly.
