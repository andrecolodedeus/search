<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the justification of the ungodly is the remission of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is not the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed not only to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but to all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 71, Article 1). Now justification signifies a certain movement towards <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore not even remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, since movement is from one contrary to the other.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything ought to be named from what is predominant in it, according to De Anima ii, text. 49. Now the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is brought about chiefly by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a>: "Purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"; and by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought to be named after <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> seems to be the same as being called, for whoever is called is afar off, and we are afar off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But one is called before being justified according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans 8:30</a>: "And whom He called, them He also justified." Therefore justification is not the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> On <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans 8:30</a>, "Whom He called, them He also justified," the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says i.e. "by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Justification taken passively implies a movement towards <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as heating implies a movement towards heat. But since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, implies a certain rectitude of order, it may be taken in two ways: first, inasmuch as it implies a right order in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> act, and thus <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is placed amongst the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--either as particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which directs a man's acts by regulating them in relation to his fellowman--or as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which directs a man's acts by regulating them in their relation to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of society, as appears from Ethic. v, 1.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is so-called inasmuch as it implies a certain rectitude of order in the interior disposition of a man, in so far as what is highest in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the inferior powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are subject to the superior, i.e. to the reason; and this disposition the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> metaphorically speaking" (Ethic. v, 11). Now this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways: first, by simple generation, which is from privation to form; and thus justification may belong even to such as are not in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when they receive this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is said to have received original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Secondly, this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be brought about in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by a movement from one contrary to the other, and thus justification implies a transmutation from the state of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the aforesaid state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And it is thus we are now speaking of the justification of the ungodly, according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans 4:5</a>): "But to him that worketh not, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him that justifieth the ungodly," etc. And because movement is named after its term "whereto" rather than from its term "whence," the transmutation whereby anyone is changed by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the state of ungodliness to the state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, borrows its name from its term "whereto," and is called "justification of the ungodly."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as it implies the disorder of a mind not subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be called <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, as being contrary to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse4">1 John 3:4</a>: "Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, committeth also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>." And thus the removal of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> imply a special directing of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will; whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> implies a general rectitude of order. Hence this transmutation is named after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than after <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Being called refers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help moving and exciting our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to give up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this motion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the infusion of grace is required for the remission of guilt, i.e. for the justification of the ungodly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that for the remission of guilt, which is the justification of the ungodly, no infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required. For anyone may be moved from one contrary without being led to the other, if the contraries are not immediate. Now the state of guilt and the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> are not immediate contraries; for there is the middle state of innocence wherein a man has neither <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> nor guilt. Hence a man may be pardoned his guilt without his being brought to a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the remission of guilt consists in the Divine imputation, according to <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse2">Psalm 31:2</a>: "Blessed is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom the Lord hath not imputed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> puts something into our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (Question 110, Article 1). Hence the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not required for the remission of guilt.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one can be subject to two contraries at once. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are contraries, as wastefulness and miserliness. Hence whoever is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of wastefulness is not simultaneously subject to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of miserliness, yet it may happen that he has been subject to it hitherto. Hence by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of wastefulness he is freed from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of miserliness. And thus a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans 3:24</a>): "Justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> a man offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as stated above (Question 71, Article 5). Now an offense is remitted to anyone, only when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the offender is at peace with the offended. Hence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted to us, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is at peace with us, and this peace consists in the love whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loves us. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love, considered on the part of the Divine act, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable; whereas, as regards the effect it imprints on us, it is sometimes interrupted, inasmuch as we sometimes fall short of it and once more require it. Now the effect of the Divine love in us, which is taken away by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby a man is made worthy of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shuts him out. Hence we could not conceive the remission of guilt, without the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> More is required for an offender to pardon an offense, than for one who has committed no offense, not to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. For it may happen amongst men that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> neither <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> nor loves another. But if the other offends him, then the forgiveness of the offense can only spring from a special goodwill. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> goodwill is said to be restored to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and hence although a man before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> may be without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and without guilt, yet that he is without guilt after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> can only be because he has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> love consists not merely in the act of the Divine will but also implies a certain effect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (Question 110, Article 1), so likewise, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not impute <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a man, there is implied a certain effect in him to whom the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not imputed; for it proceeds from the Divine love, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not imputed to a man by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup. i, 26), if to leave off <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> was the same as to have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would be enough if <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> warned us thus: "'My son, hast thou <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? do so no more?' Now this is not enough, but it is added: 'But for thy former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may be forgiven thee.'" For the act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> passes, but the guilt remains, as stated above (Question 87, Article 6). Hence when anyone passes from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, he ceases to have the act of the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but he does not cease to have the guilt, hence he may have the guilt of both <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at once. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not contrary to each other on the part of their turning from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has its guilt.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether for the justification of the ungodly is required a movement of the free-will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly. For we see that by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of Baptism</a>, infants and sometimes adults are justified without a movement of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iv) that when one of his friends was taken with a fever, "he lay for a long time senseless and in a deadly sweat, and when he was despaired of, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, and was regenerated"; which is effected by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not confine His power to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence He can justify a man without the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and without any movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man has not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> when asleep, and without it there can be no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But Solomon received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom when asleep, as related in <a href="../bible/1ki003.htm">1 Kings 3</a> and <a href="../bible/2ch001.htm">2 Chronicles 1</a>. Hence with equal reason the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is sometimes bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without the movement of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is preserved by the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as brings it into being, for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) that "so ought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as he is ever made just by Him." Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is preserved in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without a movement of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Hence it can be infused in the beginning without a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a>): "Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath learned, cometh to Me." Now to learn cannot be without a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, since the learner assents to the teacher. Hence, no one comes to the Father by justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The justification of the ungodly is brought about by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For He it is "that justifieth the ungodly" according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans 4:5</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves everything in its own manner, just as we see that in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, what is heavy and what is light are moved differently, on account of their diverse <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Hence He moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to have <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Hence in him who has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> motion to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not take place without a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; but He so infuses the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that at the same time He moves the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in such as are capable of being moved thus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Infants are not capable of the movement of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; hence it is by the mere infusion of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves them to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now this cannot be brought about without a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; because as <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, from which they are justified, does not come to them from their own will, but by carnal generation, so also is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given them by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> regeneration. And the same reason holds good with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a> and idiots that have never had the use of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But in the case of one who has had the use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> and afterwards has lost it either through sickness or sleep, he does not obtain justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the exterior rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, or of any other sacrament, unless he intended to make use of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and this can only be by the use of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. And it was in this way that he of whom <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks was regenerated, because both previously and afterwards he assented to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Solomon neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> nor received wisdom whilst asleep; but it was declared to him in his sleep that on account of his previous desire wisdom would be infused into him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is said in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse7">Wisdom 7:7</a>): "I wished, and understanding was given unto me." Or it may be said that his sleep was not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, but was the sleep of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, according to <a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers 12:6</a>: "If there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream." In such cases the use of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> remains.

<p>And yet it must be observed that the comparison between the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not hold. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> especially ordains a man to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and hence a man is moved to it by a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> which is a movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. But wisdom perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which precedes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; hence without any complete movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be enlightened with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, even as we see that things are revealed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in sleep, according to <a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse15">Job 33:15-16</a>: "When deep sleep falleth upon men and they are sleeping in their beds, then He openeth the ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and teaching, instructeth them in what they are to learn."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the infusion of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> there is a certain transmutation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and hence a proper movement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is required in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be moved in its own manner. But the conservation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is without transmutation: no movement on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is required but only a continuation of the Divine influx.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a movement of faith is required for the justification of the ungodly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly. For as a man is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so also by other things, viz. by fear, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse27">Sirach 1:27</a>): "The fear of the Lord driveth out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for he that is without fear cannot be justified"; and again by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke 7:47</a>: "Many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her because she hath loved much"; and again by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resisteth the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and giveth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>"; and again by mercy, according to <a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse27">Proverbs 15:27</a>: "By mercy and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are purged away." Hence the movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is no more required for the justification of the ungodly, than the movements of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for justification only inasmuch as a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But a man may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in other ways, viz. by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom. Hence no act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there are several <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. Therefore if the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly, it would seem that a man ought to think on every <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a> when he is first justified. But this seems inconvenient, since such thought would require a long delay of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Hence it seems that an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not required for the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans 5:1</a>): "Being justified therefore by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let us have peace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) a movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by turning it to Himself according to <a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse7">Psalm 84:7</a> (<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>): "Thou wilt turn us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bring us to life." Hence for the justification of the ungodly a movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is required, by which it is turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the first turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>: "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is." Hence a movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not perfect unless it is quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; hence in the justification of the ungodly, a movement of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is infused together with the movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is moved to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by being subject to Him; hence an act of filial fear and an act of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> also concur. For it may happen that one and the same act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> springs from different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, when one commands and another is commanded, inasmuch as the act may be ordained to various ends. But the act of mercy counteracts <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either by way of satisfying for it, and thus it follows <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>; or by way of preparation, inasmuch as the merciful obtain mercy; and thus it can either precede <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, or concur with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> towards <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, inasmuch as mercy is included in the love of our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> a man is not turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according as He is the object of beatitude and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. Hence such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not suffice for <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom presupposes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (68, 4, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans 4:5</a>), "to him that . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in Him that justifieth the ungodly his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is reputed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence it is clear that in the justification of the ungodly an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required in order that a man may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> justifies <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether for the justification of the ungodly there is required a movement of the free-will towards sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> alone suffices to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore for this justification of the ungodly no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is required.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever is tending onward, ought not to look back, according to <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians 3:13-14</a>: "Forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth myself to those that are before, I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation." But whoever is stretching forth to righteousness has his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> behind him. Hence he ought to forget them, and not stretch forth to them by a movement of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the justification of the ungodly one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not remitted without another, for "it is irreverent to expect half a pardon from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [Cap., Sunt. plures: Dist. iii, De Poenit.]. Hence, in the justification of the ungodly, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> must move against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he ought to think of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this is unseemly, both because a great space of time would be required for such thought, and because a man could not obtain the forgiveness of such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as he had forgotten. Hence for the justification of the ungodly no movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is required.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse5">Psalm 31:5</a>): "I will confess against myself my <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the Lord; and Thou hast forgiven the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the justification of the ungodly is a certain movement whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to regard both extremes by an act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as a body in local movement is related to both terms of the movement. Now it is clear that in local movement the moving body leaves the term "whence" and nears the term "whereto." Hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind whilst it is being justified, must, by a movement of its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> withdraw from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and draw near to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>Now to withdraw from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to draw near to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in an act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, means detestation and desire. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on the words "the hireling fleeth," etc. (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse12">John 10:12</a>): "Our emotions are the movements of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> outpouring; fear is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> flight; your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes forward when you seek; your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> flees, when you are afraid." Hence in the justification of the ungodly there must be two acts of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>--one, whereby it tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; the other whereby it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to seek one contrary and to avoid the other; and hence, as it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so likewise, to detest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to return to those things that are behind, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> them; but, for that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, he ought to forget them, lest he be drawn to them. Yet he ought to recall them to mind, in order to detest them; for this is to fly from them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Previous to justification a man must detest each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he remembers to have committed, and from this remembrance the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes on to have a general movement of detestation with regard to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed, in which are included such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as have been forgotten. For a man is then in such a frame of mind that he would be sorry even for those he does not remember, if they were present to his <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>; and this movement cooperates in his <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the remission of sins ought to be reckoned amongst the things required for justification?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to be reckoned amongst the things required for <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a thing is not reckoned together with those that are required for a thing; thus a man is not reckoned together with his body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the justification of the ungodly is itself the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to be reckoned among the things required for the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the same; as illumination and expulsion of darkness are the same. But a thing ought not to be reckoned together with itself; for unity is opposed to multitude. Therefore the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to be reckoned with the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> follows as effect from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; since it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven. But an effect ought not to be reckoned with its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; since things thus enumerated together, and, as it were, condivided, are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> simultaneous. Hence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought not to be reckoned with the things required for the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In reckoning what is required for a thing we ought not to pass over the end, which is the chief part of everything. Now the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is the end of the justification of the ungodly; for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse9">Isaiah 27:9</a>): "This is all the fruit, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> thereof should be taken away." Hence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ought to be reckoned amongst the things required for <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are four things which are accounted to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the justification of the ungodly, viz. the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The reason for this is that, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the justification of the ungodly is a movement whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now in the movement whereby one thing is moved by another, three things are required: first, the motion of the mover; secondly, the movement of the moved; thirdly, the consummation of the movement, or the attainment of the end. On the part of the Divine motion, there is the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> which is moved, there are two movements--of departure from the term "whence," and of approach to the term "whereto"; but the consummation of the movement or the attainment of the end of the movement is implied in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for in this is the justification of the ungodly completed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The justification of the ungodly is called the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even as every movement has its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from its term. Nevertheless, many other things are required in order to reach the term, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered in two ways: first, with respect to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act, and thus they are the same; for by the same act <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, they may be considered on the part of the objects; and thus they differ by the difference between guilt, which is taken away, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is infused; just as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things generation and corruption differ, although the generation of one thing is the corruption of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This enumeration is not the division of a genus into its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in which the things enumerated must be simultaneous; but it is division of the things required for the completion of anything; and in this enumeration we may have what precedes and what follows, since some of the principles and parts of a composite thing may precede and some follow.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the justification of the ungodly takes place in an instant or successively?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly does not take place in an instant, but successively, since, as already stated (3), for the justification of the ungodly, there is required a movement of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Now the act of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is choice, which requires the deliberation of counsel, as stated above (Question 13, Article 1). Hence, since deliberation implies a certain reasoning process, and this implies succession, the justification of the ungodly would seem to be successive.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement is not without actual consideration. But it is impossible to understand many things actually and at once, as stated above (I, 85, 4). Hence, since for the justification of the ungodly there is required a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> towards several things, viz. towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would seem impossible for the justification of the ungodly to be in an instant.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a form that may be greater or less, e.g. blackness or whiteness, is received successively by its subject. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be greater or less, as stated above (Question 112, Article 4). Hence it is not received suddenly by its subject. Therefore, seeing that the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly, it would seem that the justification of the ungodly cannot be in an instant.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement, which cooperates in <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>; and hence it must proceed from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, without which there is no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as we shall state further on (114, 2). Now a thing receives its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> before operating by this form. Hence <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is first infused, and then the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is moved towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to detest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence justification is not all at once.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is infused into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there must be an instant when it first dwells in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; so, too, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven there must be a last instant that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But it cannot be the same instant, otherwise opposites would be in the same simultaneously. Hence they must be two successive instants; between which there must be time, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. vi, 1). Therefore the justification of the ungodly takes place not all at once, but successively.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The justification of the ungodly is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> minds suddenly, according to <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts 2:2</a>: "And suddenly there came a sound from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as of a mighty wind coming," upon which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no tardy efforts." Hence the justification of the ungodly is not successive, but instantaneous.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The entire justification of the ungodly consists as to its origin in the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For it is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is moved and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted. Now the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> takes place in an instant and without succession. And the reason of this is that if a form be not suddenly impressed upon its subject, it is either because that subject is not disposed, or because the agent needs time to dispose the subject. Hence we see that immediately the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is disposed by a preceding alteration, the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form accrues to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; thus because the atmosphere of itself is disposed to receive light, it is suddenly illuminated by a body actually luminous. Now it was stated (112, 2) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to infuse <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, needs no disposition, save what He Himself has made. And sometimes this sufficient disposition for the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He makes suddenly, sometimes gradually and successively, as stated above (112, 2, ad 2). For the reason why a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent cannot suddenly dispose <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is that in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> there is a resistant which has some disproportion with the power of the agent; and hence we see that the stronger the agent, the more speedily is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> disposed. Therefore, since the Divine power is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it can suddenly dispose any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whatsoever to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and much more <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, whose movement is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> instantaneous. Therefore the justification of the ungodly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes place in an instant.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, which concurs in the justification of the ungodly, is a consent to detest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this consent takes place suddenly. Sometimes, indeed, it happens that deliberation precedes, yet this is not of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, but a way of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>; as local movement is a way of illumination, and alteration to generation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (I, 85, 5), there is nothing to prevent two things being understood at once, in so far as they are somehow one; thus we understand the subject and predicate together, inasmuch as they are united in the order of one affirmation. And in the same manner can the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> be moved to two things at once in so far as one is ordained to the other. Now the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ordained to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since a man detests <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom he wishes to cling. Hence in the justification of the ungodly the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> simultaneously detests <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and turns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as a body approaches one point and withdraws from another simultaneously.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The reason why a form is not received instantaneously in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not the fact that it can inhere more or less; for thus the light would not be suddenly received in the air, which can be illumined more or less. But the reason is to be sought on the part of the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The same instant the form is acquired, the thing begins to operate with the form; as fire, the instant it is generated moves upwards, and if its movement was instantaneous, it would be terminated in the same instant. Now to will and not to will--the movements of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>--are not successive, but instantaneous. Hence the justification of the ungodly must not be successive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The succession of opposites in the same subject must be looked at differently in the things that are subject to time and in those that are above time. For in those that are in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, there is no last instant in which the previous form inheres in the subject; but there is the last time, and the first instant that the subsequent form inheres in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject; and this for the reason, that in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> we are not to consider one instant, since neither do instants succeed each other immediately in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, nor points in a line, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Physic. vi, 1. But time is terminated by an instant. Hence in the whole of the previous time wherein anything is moving towards its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, it is under the opposite form; but in the last instant of this time, which is the first instant of the subsequent time, it has the form which is the term of the movement.

<p>But in those that are above time, it is otherwise. For if there be any succession of affections or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conceptions in them (as in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>), such succession is not measured by continuous time, but by discrete time, even as the things measured are not continuous, as stated above (I, 53, 2,3). In these, therefore, there is a last instant in which the preceding is, and a first instant in which the subsequent is. Nor must there be time in between, since there is no continuity of time, which this would necessitate.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, which is justified, is, in itself, above time, but is subject to time <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, inasmuch as it understands with continuity and time, with respect to the phantasms in which it considers the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (I, 85, A1,2). We must, therefore, decide from this about its change as regards the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of temporal movements, i.e. we must say that there is no last instant that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> inheres, but a last time; whereas there is a first instant that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> inheres; and in all the time previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> inhered.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the infusion of grace is naturally the first of the things required for the justification of the ungodly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> required first for the justification of the ungodly. For we withdraw from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before drawing near to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse15">Psalm 33:15</a>: "Turn away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> regards the turning away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> regards the turning to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> before the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the disposition <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the form to which it disposes. Now the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement is a disposition for the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hinders the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from tending freely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now a hindrance to movement must be removed before the movement takes place. Hence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> before the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to its effect. Now the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of whatever is required for the justification of the ungodly, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to it.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The aforesaid four things required for the justification of the ungodly are simultaneous in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, since the justification of the ungodly is not successive, as stated above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>); but in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, one is prior to another; and in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order the first is the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; the second, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the third, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the fourth, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>The reason for this is that in every movement the motion of the mover is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> first; the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or the movement of the moved, is second; the end or term of the movement in which the motion of the mover rests, is last. Now the motion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Mover is the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>); the movement or disposition of the moved is the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> double movement; and the term or end of the movement is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>). Hence in their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order the first in the justification of the ungodly is the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; the second is the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the third is the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for he who is being justified detests <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because it is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since it is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and reason; the fourth and last is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to which this transmutation is ordained as to an end, as stated above (1,6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The withdrawal from one term and approach to another may be looked at in two ways: first, on the part of the thing moved, and thus the withdrawal from a term <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the approach to a term, since in the subject of movement the opposite which is put away is prior to the opposite which the subject moved attains to by its movement. But on the part of the agent it is the other way about, since the agent, by the form pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in it, acts for the removal of the opposite form; as the sun by its light acts for the removal of darkness, and hence on the part of the sun, illumination is prior to the removal of darkness; but on the part of the atmosphere to be illuminated, to be freed from darkness is, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, prior to being illuminated, although both are simultaneous in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. And since the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> regard <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who justifies, hence in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is prior to the freeing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if we look at what is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> justified, it is the other way about, since in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the being freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is prior to the obtaining of justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Or it may be said that the term "whence" of justification is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and the term "whereto" is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of obtaining of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The disposition of the subject precedes the reception of the form, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet it follows the action of the agent, whereby the subject is disposed. And hence the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement precedes the reception of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and follows the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 9), in movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the movement toward the speculative principle or the practical end is the very first, but in exterior movements the removal of the impediment precedes the attainment of the end. And as the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it moves towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to its end, before removing the impediment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the justification of the ungodly is God's greatest work?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> greatest work. For it is by the justification of the ungodly that we attain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a wayfarer. Now by glorification we receive heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is greater. Hence the glorification of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men is a greater work than the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the justification of the ungodly is ordained to the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is plain from Ethic. i, 2. Hence the creation of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth is a greater work than the justification of the ungodly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to make something from nothing, where there is nought to cooperate with the agent, is greater than to make something with the cooperation of the recipient. Now in the work of creation something is made from nothing, and hence nothing can cooperate with the agent; but in the justification of the ungodly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes something from something, i.e. a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from a sinner, and there is a cooperation on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part, since there is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Hence the justification of the ungodly is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> greatest work.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse9">Psalm 144:9</a>): "His tender mercies are over all His works," and in a collect [Tenth Sunday after Pentecost] we say: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who dost show forth Thine all-mightiness most by pardoning and having mercy," and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, expounding the words, "greater than these shall he do" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>) says that "for a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be made from a sinner, is greater than to create <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A work may be called great in two ways: first, on the part of the mode of action, and thus the work of creation is the greatest work, wherein something is made from nothing; secondly, a work may be called great on account of what is made, and thus the justification of the ungodly, which terminates at the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a share in the Godhead, is greater than the creation of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, which terminates at the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of mutable <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, after saying that "for a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be made from a sinner is greater than to create <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," adds, "for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth shall pass away, but the justification of the ungodly shall endure."

<p>Again, we must bear in mind that a thing is called great in two ways: first, in an absolute <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that sanctifies the ungodly; and in this respect the glorification of the just is greater than the justification of the ungodly. Secondly, a thing may be said to be great in proportionate <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, and thus the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that justifies the ungodly is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that beatifies the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> exceeds the worthiness of the ungodly, who are worthy of punishment, more than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> exceeds the worthiness of the just, who by the fact of their justification are worthy of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says: "Let him that can, judge whether it is greater to create the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, than to justify the ungodly. Certainly, if they both betoken equal power, one betokens greater mercy."

<p>And thus the reply to the first is clear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is greater than the particular <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one, if we consider both in the same genus. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in one is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection rests on the manner of acting, in which way creation is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> greatest work.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the justification of the ungodly is a miraculous work?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work. For <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works are greater than non-miraculous. Now the justification of the ungodly is greater than the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works, as is clear from the quotation from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (9). Hence the justification of the ungodly is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is like the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. But when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things against their inclination of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work, as when He gave sight to the blind or raised the dead. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the ungodly is bent on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in justifying a man moves him to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it would seem that the justification of the ungodly is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as wisdom is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now it is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> that anyone should suddenly obtain wisdom from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without study. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> that the ungodly should be justified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Miraculous works are beyond <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. Now the justification of the ungodly is not beyond <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Praed. Sanct. v) that "to be capable of having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to be capable of having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the faithful." Therefore the justification of the ungodly is not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works it is usual to find three things: the first is on the part of the active power, because they can only be performed by Divine power; and they are simply wondrous, since their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is hidden, as stated above (I, 105, 7). And thus both the justification of the ungodly and the creation of the world, and, generally speaking, every work that can be done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p>Secondly, in certain <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works it is found that the form introduced is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, life is above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of such a body. And thus the justification of the ungodly is not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> capable of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; since from its having been made to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is fit to receive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, in the above quotation.

<p>Thirdly, in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works something is found besides the usual and customary order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> an effect, as when a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suddenly and beyond the wonted course of healing by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or art, receives perfect health; and thus the justification of the ungodly is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> and sometimes not. For the common and wonted course of justification is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> interiorly and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first by an imperfect conversion, that it may afterwards become perfect; because "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> begun <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> increase, and when increased <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> perfection," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (In Epist. Joan. Tract. v). Yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so vehemently that it reaches the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> at once, as took place in the conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which was accompanied at the same time by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> external prostration. Hence the conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> works, although they are less than the justification of the ungodly, as regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>, are beyond the wonted order of such effects, and thus have more of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work, whenever a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing is moved contrary to its inclination, otherwise it would be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> for water to be heated, or for a stone to be thrown upwards; but only whenever this takes place beyond the order of the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> does this. Now no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can justify the ungodly, even as nothing save fire can heat water. Hence the justification of the ungodly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> in this respect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> acquires wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his own talent and study. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> when a man is made wise or learned outside this order. But a man does not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> acquire justifying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by his own action, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. Hence there is no parity.
