<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether men are guarded by the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men are not guarded by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For guardians are deputed to some because they either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, or are not able, to guard themselves, as children and the sick. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to guard himself by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not guarded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a strong guard makes a weaker one superfluous. But men are guarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse4">Psalm 120:4</a>: "He shall neither slumber nor sleep, that keepeth <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not need to be guarded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the loss of the guarded redounds to the negligence of the guardian; hence it was said to a certain one: "Keep this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life" (<a href="../bible/1ki020.htm#verse39">1 Kings 20:39</a>). Now many perish daily through falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could help by visible appearance, or by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or in some such-like way. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would therefore be negligent if men are given to their guardianship. But that is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not the guardians of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa090.htm#verse11">Psalm 90:11</a>): "He hath given His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the plan of Divine Providence, we find that in all things the movable and variable are moved and regulated by the immovable and invariable; as all corporeal things by immovable <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and the inferior bodies by the superior which are invariable in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. We ourselves also are regulated as regards conclusions, about which we may have various opinions, by the principles which we hold in an invariable manner. It is moreover manifest that as regards things to be done <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and affection can vary and fail from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in many ways; and so it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> should be deputed for the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in order to regulate them and move them to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to a certain degree, but not in any sufficient degree; forasmuch as he is weak in affection towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of the manifold <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Likewise universal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to a certain degree directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but not in a sufficient degree; because in the application of the universal principles of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to particular actions <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> happens to be deficient in many ways. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom 9:14</a>): "The thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain." Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be guarded by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Two things are required for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action; first, that the affection be inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is effected in us by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Secondly, that reason should discover the proper methods to make perfect the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; this the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi) attributes to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. As regards the first, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> guards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> immediately by infusing into him <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; as regards the second, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> guards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as his universal instructor, Whose precepts reach <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the medium of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as above stated (111, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As men depart from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> passion, so also do they depart from the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which takes place invisibly when they enlighten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he may do what is right. Hence that men perish is not to be imputed to the negligence of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> but to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. That they sometimes appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> visibly outside the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> comes from a special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as likewise that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> occur outside the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether each man is guarded by an angel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not guarded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is stronger than a man. But one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffices to guard many men. Therefore much more can one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guard many men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the lower things are brought to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the medium of the higher, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv, xiii). But as all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are unequal (50, 4), there is only one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> between whom and men there is no medium. Therefore there is only one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who immediately keeps men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are deputed to the greater offices. But it is not a greater office to keep one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> more than another; since all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> equal. Since therefore of all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> one is greater than another, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. x), it seems that different men are not guarded by different <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> On the text, "Their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," etc. (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse10">Matthew 8:10</a>), <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says: "Great is the dignity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for each one to have an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> deputed to guard it from its birth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian appointed to him. This rests upon the fact that the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> belongs to the execution of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> concerning men. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> acts differently as regards men and as regards other corruptible creatures, for they are related differently to incorruptibility. For men are not only incorruptible in the common <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also in the proper forms of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, which are the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which cannot be said of other incorruptible things. Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is chiefly exercised towards what remains for ever; whereas as regards things which pass away, the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts so as to order their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to the things which are perpetual. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is related to each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as it is to every genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things corruptible. But, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), the different orders are deputed to the different "genera" of things, for instance, the "Powers" to coerce the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, the "Virtues" to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in things corporeal; while it is probable that the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are presided over by different <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the same order. Hence it is also reasonable to suppose that different <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are appointed to the guardianship of different men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A guardian may be assigned to a man for two reasons: first, inasmuch as a man is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and thus to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> one guardian is due; and sometimes several are appointed to guard one.

<p>Secondly, inasmuch as a man is part of a community, and thus one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is appointed as guardian of a whole community; to whom it belongs to provide what concerns one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his relation to the whole community, such as external works, which are sources of strength or weakness to others. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardians are given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also as regards invisible and occult things, concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of each one in his own regard. Hence <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are appointed to guard <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As above stated (112, 3, ad 4), all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are, as to some things, enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly; but as to other things, only the superior are directly enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and these reveal them to the inferior. And the same also applies to the inferior orders: for a lower <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is enlightened in some respects by one of the highest, and in other respects by the one immediately above him. Thus it is possible that some one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> enlightens a man immediately, and yet has other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> beneath him whom he enlightens.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although men are equal in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, still inequality <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> among them, according as Divine Providence orders some to the greater, and others to the lesser things, according to <a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse11">Sirach 33:11-12</a>: "With much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the Lord hath divided them, and diversified their ways: some of them hath He blessed and exalted, and some of them hath He <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> and brought low." Thus it is a greater office to guard one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than another.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether to guard men belongs only to the lowest order of angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> does not belong only to the lowest order of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says that the text (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a>), "Their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," etc. is to be understood not of any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> but of the highest. Therefore the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> guard men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "are sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>); and thus it seems that the mission of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is directed to the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But five orders are sent in external ministry (112, 4). Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the five orders are deputed to the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, for the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it seems especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to coerce the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which belongs most of all to the Powers, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.); and to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which belongs to the Virtues. Therefore these orders are also deputed to the work of guardianship, and not only the lowest order.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In the <a href="../bible/psa090.htm">Psalm (90)</a> the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; who belong to the lowest order, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. v, ix).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As above stated (2), <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is guarded in two ways; in one way by particular guardianship, according as to each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is appointed to guard him; and such guardianship belongs to the lowest order of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whose place it is, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, to announce the "lesser things"; for it seems to be the least of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> offices to procure what concerns the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of only one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The other kind of guardianship is universal, multiplied according to the different orders. For the more universal an agent is, the higher it is. Thus the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> belongs to the order of "Principalities," or perhaps to the "Archangels," whom we call the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> princes. Hence, Michael, whom we call an archangel, is also styled "one of the princes" (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse13">Daniel 10:13</a>). Moreover all corporeal creatures are guarded by the "Virtues"; and likewise the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by the "Powers," and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirits by the "Principalities," according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> opinion (Hom. xxxiv in Ev.).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> can be taken to mean the highest in the lowest order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. x) in each order there are first, middle, and last. It is, however, probable that the greater <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are deputed to keep those chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the higher degree of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sent have guardianship of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> men; but some orders have a universal guardianship, greater or less, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercise the office of the superior, as they share in their <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and they are executors of the superiors' power; and in this way all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the lowest order can coerce the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether angels are appointed to the guardianship of all men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not appointed to the guardianship of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>) that "He was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> found as a man." If therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are appointed to the guardianship of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also would have had an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian. But this is unseemly, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is greater than all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not appointed to the guardianship of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was the first of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But it was not fitting that he should have an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian, at least in the state of innocence: for then he was not beset by any dangers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not appointed to the guardianship of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are appointed to the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may take them by the hand and guide them to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, encourage them to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and protect them against the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But men who are foreknown to damnation, never attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Infidels, also, though at times they perform <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, do not perform them well, for they have not a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>: for "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> directs the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enarr. ii in Ps. 31). Moreover, the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> will be "according to the working of Satan," as it is written (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not deputed to the guardianship of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> is the authority of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> quoted above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), for he says that "each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appointed to guard it."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man while in this state of life, is, as it were, on a road by which he should journey towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. On this road <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is threatened by many dangers both from within and from without, according to <a href="../bible/psa141.htm#verse4">Psalm 141:4</a>: "In this way wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me." And therefore as guardians are appointed for men who have to pass by an unsafe road, so an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian is assigned to each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as long as he is a wayfarer. When, however, he arrives at the end of life he no longer has a guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but in the kingdom he will have an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to reign with him, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> to punish him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was guided immediately by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: wherefore He needed not be guarded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Again as regards His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He was a comprehensor, although in regard to His passible body, He was a wayfarer. In this latter respect it was right that He should have not a guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as superior to Him, but a ministering <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as inferior to Him. Whence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered to Him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the state of innocence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was not threatened by any peril from within: because within him all was well ordered, as we have said above (95, 1,3). But peril threatened from without on account of the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the event. For this reason he needed a guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the foreknown, the infidels, and even <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Anti-christ</a>, are not deprived of the interior help of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; so neither are they deprived of that exterior help granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>--namely the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And although the help which they receive therefrom does not result in their deserving <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, it does nevertheless conduce to their being protected from certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which would hurt both themselves and others. For even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are held off by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, lest they hurt as much as they would. In like manner <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> will not do as much harm as he would wish.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether an angel is appointed to guard a man from his birth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not appointed to guard a man from his birth. For <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are "sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews 1:14</a>). But men begin to receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is appointed to guard a man from the time of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not of his birth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, men are guarded by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in as far as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enlighten and instruct them. But children are not capable of instruction as soon as they are born, for they have not the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not appointed to guard children as soon as they are born.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a child has a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for some time before birth, just as well as after. But it does not appear that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is appointed to guard a child before its birth, for they are not then admitted to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not appointed to guard men from the moment of their birth.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (vide A, 4) that "each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appointed to guard it from its birth."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> observes (Tract. v, super Matt.) there are two opinions on this matter. For some have held that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian is appointed at the time of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, others, that he is appointed at the time of birth. The latter opinion <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> approves (vide A, 4), and with reason. For those benefits which are conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, begin with his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; such as receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and the like. But those which are conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a rational being, are bestowed on him at his birth, for then it is that he receives that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Among the latter benefits we must count the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as we have said above (1,4). Wherefore from the very moment of his birth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian appointed to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Angels are sent to minister, and that efficaciously indeed, for those who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if we consider the ultimate effect of their guardianship, which is the realizing of that inheritance. But for all that, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> ministrations are not withdrawn for others although they are not so efficacious as to bring them to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: efficacious, nevertheless, they are, inasmuch as they ward off many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Guardianship is ordained to enlightenment by instruction, as to its ultimate and principal effect. Nevertheless it has many other effects consistent with childhood; for instance to ward off the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to prevent both bodily and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> harm.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As long as the child is in the mother's womb it is not entirely separate, but by reason of a certain intimate tie, is still part of her: just as the fruit while hanging on the tree is part of the tree. And therefore it can be said with some degree of probability, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who guards the mother guards the child while in the womb. But at its birth, when it becomes separate from the mother, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian is appointed to it; as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, above quoted, says.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the angel guardian ever forsakes a man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian sometimes forsakes the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom he is appointed to guard. For it is said (<a href="../bible/jer051.htm#verse9">Jeremiah 51:9</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: "We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her." And (<a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse5">Isaiah 5:5</a>) it is written: "I will take away the hedge"--that is, "the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" [<a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>]--"and it shall be wasted."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> guardianship excels that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forsakes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at times, according to <a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse2">Psalm 21:2</a>: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me?" Much rather therefore does an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian forsake <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 3), "When the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are here with us, they are not in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." But sometimes they are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore sometimes they forsake us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are ever assailing us, according to <a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8</a>: "Your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as a roaring lion, goeth about, seeking whom he may devour." Much more therefore do the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ever guard us.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As appears above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is an effect of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it is evident that neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor anything at all, is entirely withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for in as far as a thing participates being, so far is it subject to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> that extends over all being. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed is said to forsake <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the ordering of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, but only in so far as He allows <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to suffer some defect of punishment or of fault. In like manner it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardian never forsakes a man entirely, but sometimes he leaves him in some particular, for instance by not preventing him from being subject to some trouble, or even from falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to the ordering of Divine judgments. In this sense Babylon and the House of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are said to have been forsaken by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> guardians did not prevent them from being subject to tribulation.

<p>From this the answers are clear to the first and second objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> may forsake a man sometimes locally, he does not for that reason forsake him as to the effect of his guardianship: for even when he is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is happening to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor does he need time for his local motion, for he can be with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in an instant.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether angels grieve for the ills of those whom they guard?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> grieve for the ills of those whom they guard. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse7">Isaiah 33:7</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of peace shall weep bitterly." But weeping is a sign of grief and sorrow. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> grieve for the ills of those whom they guard.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15), "sorrow is for those things that happen against our will." But the loss of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom he has guarded is against the guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> will. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> grieve for the loss of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as sorrow is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, so penance is contrary to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> rejoice about one sinner doing penance, as we are told, <a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke 15:7</a>. Therefore they grieve for the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse12">Numbers 18:12</a>: "Whatsoever first-fruits they offer," etc. the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are brought to judgment as to whether men have fallen through their negligence or through their own fault." But it is reasonable for anyone to grieve for the ills which have brought him to judgment. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> grieve for men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Where there is grief and sorrow, there is not perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 21:4</a>): "Death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow." But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Therefore they have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for grief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Angels do not grieve, either for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or for the pains inflicted on men. For grief and sorrow, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15) are for those things which occur against our will. But nothing happens in the world contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the other blessed, because they will cleaves entirely to the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; while nothing happens in the world save what is effected or permitted by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore simply speaking, nothing occurs in the world against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the blessed. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 1) that is called simply <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, which a man wills in a particular case, and at a particular time, having considered all the circumstances; although universally speaking, such a thing would not be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>: thus the sailor does not will the casting of his cargo into the sea, considered universally and absolutely, but on account of the threatened danger of his life, he wills it. Wherefore this is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rather than involuntary, as stated in the same passage. Therefore universally and absolutely speaking the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the pains inflicted on its account: but they do will the fulfilment of the ordering of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in this matter, in respect of which some are subjected to pains and are allowed to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of Isaias may be understood of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, i.e. the messengers, of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, who wept on account of the words of Rabsaces, as related <a href="../bible/isa037.htm#verse2">Isaiah 37:2 seqq.</a>: this would be the literal sense. According to the allegorical sense the "<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of peace" are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and preachers who weep for men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. If according to the anagogical sense this passage be expounded of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, then the expression is metaphorical, and signifies that universally speaking the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: for in this sense we attribute <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p>The reply to the second objection appears from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> repentance and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is one reason for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, namely the fulfilment of the ordering of the Divine Providence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are brought into judgment for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not as guilty, but as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to convict <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of weakness.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether there can be strife or discord among the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be strife or discord among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse2">Job 25:2</a>): "Who maketh peace in His high places." But strife is opposed to peace. Therefore among the high <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there is no strife.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where there is perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and just authority there can be no strife. But all this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore there is no strife among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if we say that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> strive for those whom they guard, one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> must needs take one side, and another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the opposite side. But if one side is in the right the other side is in the wrong. It will follow therefore, that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a compounder of wrong; which is unseemly. Therefore there is no strife among <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse13">Daniel 10:13</a>): "The prince of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> resisted me one and twenty days." But this prince of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> deputed to the guardianship of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> resists the others; and thus there is strife among them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The raising of this question is occasioned by this passage of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> explains it by saying that the prince of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who opposed the setting free of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for whom <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> being offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by Gabriel. And this resistance of his may have been <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> having led the Jewish captives in Persia into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was an impediment to the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> put up for that same people.

<p>But according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xvii), the prince of the kingdom of Persia was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appointed to the guardianship of that kingdom. To see therefore how one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be said to resist another, we must note that the Divine judgments in regard to various kingdoms and various men are executed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now in their actions, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are ruled by the Divine decree. But it happens at times in various kingdoms or various men there are contrary <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits, so that one of them is subject to or placed over another. As to what is the ordering of Divine wisdom on such matters, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveal it to them: and so they need to consult Divine wisdom thereupon. Wherefore forasmuch as they consult the Divine will concerning various contrary and opposing <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, they are said to resist one another: not that their wills are in opposition, since they are all of one mind as to the fulfilment of the Divine decree; but that the things about which they seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are in opposition.

<p>From this the answers to the objections are clear.
