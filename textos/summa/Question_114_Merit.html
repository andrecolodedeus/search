<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a man may merit anything from God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For no one, it would seem, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> by giving another his due. But by all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we do, we cannot make sufficient return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since yet more is His due, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 14). Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke 17:10</a>): "When you have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." Therefore a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it would seem that a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by what profits himself only, and profits <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing. Now by acting well, a man profits himself or another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/job035.htm#verse7">Job 35:7</a>): "If thou do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, what shalt thou give Him, or what shall He receive of thy hand." Hence a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> anything from another makes him his debtor; for a man's wage is a debt due to him. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no one's debtor; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse35">Romans 11:35</a>): "Who hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be made to him?" Hence no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> anything from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 31:16</a>): "There is a reward for thy work." Now a reward means something bestowed by reason of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence it would seem that a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Merit and reward refer to the same, for a reward means something given anyone in return for work or toil, as a price for it. Hence, as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to give a just price for anything received from another, so also is it an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to make a return for work or toil. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is a kind of equality, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 3), and hence <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is simply between those that are simply equal; but where there is no absolute equality between them, neither is there absolute <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but there may be a certain manner of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as when we speak of a father's or a master's right (Ethic. v, 6), as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says. And hence where there is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> simply, there is the character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and reward simply. But where there is no simple right, but only relative, there is no character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> simply, but only relatively, in so far as the character of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is found there, since the child <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> something from his father and the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> from his lord.

<p>Now it is clear that between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is the greatest inequality: for they are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> apart, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence there can be no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of absolute equality between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only of a certain proportion, inasmuch as both operate after their own manner. Now the manner and measure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> on the presupposition of the Divine ordination, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a reward of his operation, what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave him the power of operation for, even as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things by their proper movements and operations obtain that to which they were ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; differently, indeed, since the rational creature moves itself to act by its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, hence its action has the character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which is not so in other creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, inasmuch as he does what he ought, by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; otherwise the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby anyone discharges a debt would not be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seeks from our goods not profit, but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, i.e. the manifestation of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; even as He seeks it also in His own works. Now nothing accrues to Him, but only to ourselves, by our worship of Him. Hence we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not that by our works anything accrues to Him, but inasmuch as we work for His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since our action has the character of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, only on the presupposition of the Divine ordination, it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made our debtor simply, but His own, inasmuch as it is right that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> should be carried out.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether anyone without grace can merit eternal life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> anyone can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what he is divinely ordained to, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is ordained to beatitude as his end; hence, too, he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> wishes to be blessed. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments and without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> beatitude which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the less a work is due, the more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> it is. Now, less due is that work which is done by one who has received fewer benefits. Hence, since he who has only <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments has received fewer <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than he who has gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it would seem that his works are more <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus if he who has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> to some extent, much more may he who has no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy and liberality <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mercy and liberality. Now a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from another, even though he has not hitherto had his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Much more, therefore, would it seem that a man without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, life everlasting."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be looked at in two states, as was said above (Question 109, Article 2): the first, a state of perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the second, a state of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in which we are before being restored by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the first state, there is only one reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by his purely <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endowments, viz. because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends on the Divine pre-ordination. Now no act of anything whatsoever is divinely ordained to anything exceeding the proportion of the powers which are the principles of its act; for it is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> that nothing shall act beyond its powers. Now everlasting life is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> exceeding the proportion of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; since it exceeds its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and desire, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." And hence it is that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a sufficient principle of an act <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, unless there is added a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, which we call <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a second reason is added to this, viz. the impediment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, excluding us from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, as is clear from what has been said above (71, 6; 113, 2), no one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in a state of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> unless first he be reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being forgiven, which is brought about by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the sinner deserves not life, but death, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>: "The wages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordained <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to attain the end of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, not by its own strength, but by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and in this way its act can be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man cannot have a work equal to a work proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since the more perfect the principle, the more perfect the action. But the objection would hold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if we supposed the operations equal in both cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> With regard to the first reason adduced, the case is different in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For a man receives all his power of well-doing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> except by His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> expresses aptly saying (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse35">Romans 11:35</a>): "Who hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be made to him?" But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, before he has received anything from him, by what he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>But as regards the second <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> taken from the impediment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the case is similar with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from another whom he has offended, unless he makes satisfaction to him and is reconciled.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a man in grace can merit eternal life condignly?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> condignly, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a>): "The sufferings of this time are not worthy [condignae] to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come, that shall be revealed in us." But of all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works, the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> would seem the most <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Therefore no works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> condignly.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, life everlasting," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "He might have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said: 'The wages of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, life everlasting'; but He preferred to say 'The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, life everlasting,' that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> leads us to life everlasting of His own mercy and not by our <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>." Now when anyone <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> something condignly he receives it not from mercy, but from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Hence it would seem that a man with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> life everlasting condignly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> that equals the reward, would seem to be condign. Now no act of the present life can equal everlasting life, which surpasses our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and our desire, and moreover, surpasses the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or love of the wayfarer, even as it exceeds <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> condignly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is granted in accordance with a fair judgment, would seem a condign reward. But life everlasting is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in accordance with the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse8">2 Timothy 4:8</a>: "As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which the Lord, the just judge, will render to me in that day." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> everlasting life condignly.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work may be considered in two ways: first, as it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; secondly, as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If it is considered as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the work, and inasmuch as it springs from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, there can be no condignity because of the very great inequality. But there is congruity, on account of an equality of proportion: for it would seem congruous that, if a man does what he can, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should reward him according to the excellence of his power.

<p>If, however, we speak of a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> work, inasmuch as it proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moving us to life everlasting, it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of life everlasting condignly. For thus the value of its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends upon the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moving us to life everlasting according to <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John 4:14</a>: "Shall become in him a fount of water springing up into life everlasting." And the worth of the work depends on the dignity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby a man, being made a partaker of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, is adopted as a son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom the inheritance is due by right of adoption, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans 8:17</a>: "If sons, heirs also."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of these sufferings.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying is to be understood of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our reaching everlasting life, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy. But our <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is a subsequent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which we have at present, although unequal to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in act, is equal to it virtually as the seed of a tree, wherein the whole tree is virtually. So likewise by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and He is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of life everlasting; hence, <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse22">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>, He is called the "pledge" of our inheritance.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether grace is the principle of merit through charity rather than the other virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For wages are due to work, according to <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse8">Matthew 20:8</a>: "Call the laborers and pay them their hire." Now every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a principle of some operation, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is an operative <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above (Question 55, Article 2). Hence every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is equally a principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall receive his own reward according to his labor." Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> lessens rather than increases the labor, because as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verbis Dom., Serm. lxx), "love makes all hard and repulsive tasks easy and next to nothing." Hence <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is no greater principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greatest principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> would seem to be the one whose acts are most <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. But the acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patience or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> would seem to be the most <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, as appears in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who strove for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> patiently and bravely even till death. Hence other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are a greater principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> than <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John 14:21</a>): "He that loveth Me, shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him." Now everlasting life consists in the manifest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>" and living "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> rests chiefly with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As we may gather from what has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: first and chiefly from the Divine ordination, inasmuch as acts are said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is divinely ordained. Secondly, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, more than other creatures, has the power of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts by acting by himself. And in both these ways does <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> chiefly rest with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For we must bear in mind that everlasting life consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind's movement to the fruition of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the proper <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, whereby all the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are ordained to this end, since all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of life everlasting pertains first to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and secondly, to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, inasmuch as their acts are commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. So, likewise, is it manifest that what we do out of love we do most willingly. Hence, even inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends on voluntariness, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is chiefly attributed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a>, inasmuch as it has the last end for object, moves the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to act. For the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to which the end pertains always commands the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> to which the means pertain, as was said above (Question 9, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A work can be toilsome and difficult in two ways: first, from the greatness of the work, and thus the greatness of the work pertains to the increase of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not lessen the toil--rather, it makes us undertake the greatest toils, "for it does great things, if it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxx). Secondly, from the defect of the operator; for what is not done with a ready <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is hard and difficult to all of us, and this toil lessens <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and is removed by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> unless "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . worketh by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians 5:6</a>). So, too, the acts of patience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> unless a man does them out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>: "If I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man may merit for himself the first grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. clxxxvi), "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>." Now a man is justified by the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> only to the worthy. Now, no one is said to be worthy of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless he has <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> it condignly. Therefore we may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> condignly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, with men we may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> already received. Thus if a man receives a horse from his master, he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> it by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of it in his master's service. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is much more bountiful than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Much more, therefore, may a man, by subsequent works, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> already received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is repugnant to reward of works, according to <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse4">Romans 4:4</a>: "Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> but according to debt." Now a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> what is reckoned to him according to debt, as the reward of his works. Hence a man may not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may be considered in two ways: first in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, and thus it is manifest that all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is repugnant to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans 11:6</a>), "if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not now by works." Secondly, it may be considered as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing given, and thus, also, it cannot come under the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of him who has not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, both because it exceeds the proportion of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and because previous to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a man in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has an obstacle to his meriting <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But when anyone has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> already possessed cannot come under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since reward is the term of the work, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the principle of all our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, as stated above (109). But of anyone <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> a further gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> by virtue of the preceding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would not be the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is manifest that no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 23), he was deceived on this point for a time, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be from us, and its consummation to be granted us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this he here retracts. And seemingly it is in this sense that he speaks of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as meriting <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>. But if we suppose, as indeed it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first act must flow from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and thus it cannot be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not as though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, were to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a>, but that, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, whilst he is being justified; inasmuch as a movement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required for the justification of the ungodly, as stated above (Question 113, Article 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to none but to the worthy, not that they were previously worthy, but that by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He makes them worthy, Who alone "can make him clean that is conceived of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> seed" (<a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse4">Job 14:4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work proceeds from the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as from its principle; but not from any <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently, there is no comparison between <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether a man can merit the first grace for another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another. Because on <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew 9:2</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," etc. a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "How much is our personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> worth with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who set such a price on another's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as to heal the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> both inwardly and outwardly!" Now inward healing is brought about by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence a man can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the just are not void, but efficacious, according to <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>: "The continued <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> availeth much." Now he had previously said: "Pray one for another, that you may be saved." Hence, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> can only be brought about by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it seems that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another his first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a>): "Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, that when you shall fail they may receive you into everlasting dwellings." Now it is through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone that anyone is received into everlasting dwellings, for by it alone does anyone <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> everlasting life as stated above (2; 109, 5). Hence one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> obtain for another his first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 15:1</a>): "If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel shall stand before Me, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not towards this people" --yet they had great <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it seems that no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As shown above (1,3,4), our works are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: first, by virtue of the Divine motion; and thus we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> condignly; secondly, according as they proceed from <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> in so far as we do them willingly, and thus they have congruous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since it is congruous that when a man makes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of his power <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should by His super-excellent power work still higher things. And therefore it is clear that no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> condignly for another his first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, save Christ alone; since each one of us is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to reach life everlasting through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; hence condign <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> does not reach beyond this motion. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not only so as to reach the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of life everlasting, but so as to lead others to it, inasmuch as He is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the Author of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse10">Hebrews 2:10</a>: "Who hath brought many children into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> [to perfect] the Author of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."

<p>But one may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another congruously; because a man in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> fulfils <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, and it is congruous and in harmony with friendship that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should fulfil <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> desire for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of another, although sometimes there may be an impediment on the part of him whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires. And it is in this sense that the passage from <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> speaks.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> avails for another's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by congruous and not by condign <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The impetration of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> rests on mercy, whereas condign <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> rests on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; hence a man may impetrate many things from the Divine mercy in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which he does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse18">Daniel 9:18</a>: "For it is not for our justifications that we present our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before Thy face, but for the multitude of Thy tender mercies."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The poor who receive <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are said to receive others into everlasting dwellings, either by impetrating their forgiveness in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or by meriting congruously by other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, or materially speaking, inasmuch as by these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>, exercised towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to be received into everlasting dwellings.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether a man may merit restoration after a fall?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that anyone may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself restoration after a fall. For what a man may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now nothing may more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be besought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to be restored after a fall, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Cf. Ennar. i super Ps. lxx.], according to <a href="../bible/psa070.htm#verse9">Psalm 70:9</a>: "When my strength shall fail, do not Thou forsake me." Hence a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to be restored after a fall.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a man's works benefit himself more than another. Now a man may, to some extent, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another his restoration after a fall, even as his first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Much more, therefore, may he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself restoration after a fall.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when a man is once in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> life everlasting by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works he does, as was shown above (2; 109, 5). Now no one can attain life everlasting unless he is restored by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it would seem that he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> for himself restoration.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse24">Ezekiel 18:24</a>): "If the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turn himself away from his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and do <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> . . . all his justices which he hath done shall not be remembered." Therefore his previous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> will nowise help him to rise again. Hence no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself restoration after a fall.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself restoration after a future fall, either condignly or congruously. He cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself condignly, since the reason of this <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depends on the motion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, and this motion is interrupted by the subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; hence all benefits which he afterwards obtains from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby he is restored, do not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>--the motion of the preceding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> not extending to them. Again, congruous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, whereby one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another, is prevented from having its effect on account of the impediment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the one for whom it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a>. Much more, therefore, is the efficacy of such <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> impeded by the obstacle which is in him who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, and in him for whom it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a>; for both these are in the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. And therefore a man can nowise <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for himself restoration after a fall.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The desire whereby we seek for restoration after a fall is called <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> whereby this restoration is besought is called <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, because it tends to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and not that it depends on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but only on mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Anyone may congruously <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another his first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because there is no impediment (at least, on the part of him who <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>), such as is found when anyone recedes from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> after the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some have said that no one "absolutely" <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> life everlasting except by the act of final <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but only "conditionally," i.e. if he perseveres. But it is unreasonable to say this, for sometimes the act of the last <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not more, but less <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> than preceding acts, on account of the prostration of illness. Hence it must be said that every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> absolutely; but by subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there arises an impediment to the preceding <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, so that it does not obtain its effect; just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> fail of their effects on account of a supervening impediment.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether a man may merit the increase of grace or charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For when anyone receives the reward he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> no other reward is due to him; thus it was said of some (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse2">Matthew 6:2</a>): "They have received their reward." Hence, if anyone were to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it would follow that, when his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has been increased, he could not expect any further reward, which is unfitting.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing acts beyond its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the principle of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as was shown above (Question 2, Article 4). Therefore no one can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> than he has.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> by every act flowing from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as by every such act a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> life everlasting. If, therefore, the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, it would seem that by every act quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> a man would <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But what a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, he infallibly receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless hindered by subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse12">2 Timothy 1:12</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Whom I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and I am certain that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him." Hence it would follow that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is increased by every <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act; and this would seem impossible since at times <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> acts are not very fervent, and would not suffice for the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not come under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (super Ep. Joan.; cf. Ep. clxxxvi) that "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> increase, and being increased <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> to be perfected." Hence the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (6,7), whatever the motion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> reaches to, falls under condign <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now the motion of a mover extends not merely to the last term of the movement, but to the whole progress of the movement. But the term of the movement of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>; and progress in this movement is by the increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> according to <a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse18">Proverbs 4:18</a>: "But the path of the just as a shining light, goeth forward and increaseth even to perfect day," which is the day of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And thus the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> falls under condign <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Reward is the term of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But there is a double term of movement, viz. the last, and the intermediate, which is both beginning and term; and this term is the reward of increase. Now the reward of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favor is as the last end to those who place their end in it; hence such as these receive no other reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not above the virtuality of the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although it is above its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, even as a tree is not above the virtuality of the seed, although above its <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By every <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act a man <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, equally with the consummation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But just as <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is not given at once, but in its own time, so neither is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> increased at once, but in its own time, viz. when a man is sufficiently disposed for the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether a man may merit perseverance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that anyone may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> perseverance. For what a man obtains by asking, can come under the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of anyone that is in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> obtain perseverance by asking it of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; otherwise it would be useless to ask it of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the petitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Dono Persev. ii). Therefore perseverance may come under the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of whoever has <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is more not to be able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But not to be able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, for we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, of which impeccability is an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part. Much more, therefore, may we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e. to persevere.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is greater than perseverance in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we already possess. But a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). Much more, therefore, may he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> perseverance in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he has already.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What we <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, we obtain from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless it is hindered by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now many have <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> works, who do not obtain perseverance; nor can it be urged that this takes place because of the impediment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself is opposed to perseverance; and thus if anyone were to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> perseverance, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not permit him to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence perseverance does not come under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> flexible towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there are two ways of obtaining from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perseverance in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: first, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is determined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by consummate <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which will be in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; secondly, on the part of the Divine motion, which inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto the end. Now as explained above (6,7,8), that which is related as a term to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the mover, falls under <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; and not what is related to the aforesaid movement as principle. Hence it is clear that the perseverance of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is the term of the aforesaid movement falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>; but perseverance of the wayfarer does not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since it depends solely on the Divine motion, which is the principle of all <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> freely bestows the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of perseverance, on whomsoever He bestows it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We impetrate in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> things that we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears sinners who beseech the pardon of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which they do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, as appears from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Tract. xliv in Joan.] on <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse31">John 11:31</a>, "Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners," otherwise it would have been useless for the publican to say: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be merciful to me a sinner," <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke 18:13</a>. So too may we impetrate of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of perseverance either for ourselves or for others, although it does not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The perseverance which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is compared as term to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> movement; not so, the perseverance of the wayfarer, for the reason given in the body of the article.

<p>In the same way may we answer the third objection which concerns the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as was explained above.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether temporal goods fall under merit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that temporal goods fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. For what is promised to some as a reward of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now, temporal goods were promised in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> as the reward of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/deu028.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Hence it seems that temporal goods fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that would seem to fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestows on anyone for a service done. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes bestows temporal goods on men for services done for Him. For it is written (<a href="../bible/exo001.htm#verse21">Exodus 1:21</a>): "And because the midwives feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He built them houses"; on which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xviii, 4) says that "life everlasting might have been awarded them as the fruit of their goodwill, but on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of falsehood they received an earthly reward." And it is written (<a href="../bible/eze029.htm#verse18">Ezekiel 29:18</a>): "The King of Babylon hath made his army to undergo hard service against Tyre . . . and there hath been no reward given him," and further on: "And it shall be wages for his army . . . I have given him the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> because he hath labored for me." Therefore temporal goods fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> so is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to demerit. But on account of the demerit of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> some are punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with temporal punishments, as appears from the Sodomites, <a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis 19</a>. Hence temporal goods fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the contrary, What falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> does not come upon all alike. But temporal goods regard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> alike; according to <a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a>: "All things equally happen to the just and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to the clean and to the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, to him that offereth victims and to him that despiseth <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>." Therefore temporal goods do not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What falls under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is the reward or wage, which is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is twofold: the first, simply; the second, relatively. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply is his last end (according to <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse27">Psalm 72:27</a>: "But it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for men to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>") and consequently what is ordained and leads to this end; and these fall simply under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. But the relative, not the simple, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him now, or what is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him relatively; and this does not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> simply, but relatively.

<p>Hence we must say that if temporal goods are considered as they are useful for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> works, whereby we are led to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, they fall directly and simply under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, even as increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and everything whereby a man is helped to attain beatitude after the first <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives men, both just and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, enough temporal goods to enable them to attain to everlasting life; and thus these temporal goods are simply <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse10">Psalm 33:10</a>): "For there is no want to them that fear Him," and again, <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse25">Psalm 36:25</a>: "I have not seen the just forsaken," etc.

<p>But if these temporal goods are considered in themselves, they are not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, but relatively, and thus they do not fall under <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> simply, but relatively, inasmuch as men are moved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do temporal works, in which with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help they reach their purpose. And thus as life everlasting is simply the reward of the works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in relation to the Divine motion, as stated above (3,6), so have temporal goods, considered in themselves, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of reward, with respect to the Divine motion, whereby men's wills are moved to undertake these works, even though, sometimes, men have not a right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Faust. iv, 2), "in these temporal promises were figures of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things to come. For the carnal people were adhering to the promises of the present life; and not merely their speech but even their life was <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These rewards are said to have been divinely brought about in relation to the Divine motion, and not in relation to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of their wills, especially as regards the King of Babylon, since he did not besiege Tyre as if wishing to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather in order to usurp dominion. So, too, although the midwives had a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will with regard to saving the children, yet their will was not right, inasmuch as they framed falsehoods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are imposed as a punishment on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, inasmuch as they are not thereby helped to reach life everlasting. But to the just who are aided by these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> they are not punishments but medicines as stated above (Question 87, Article 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> All things happen equally to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but not as regards the end, since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are led to beatitude by them.

<p>And now enough has been said regarding morals in general.
