<h1>Question 114. The friendliness which is called affability</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3114.htm#article1"> Is it a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3114.htm#article2"> Is it a part of justice?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether friendliness is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that friendliness is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 3) that "the perfect friendship is that which is on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Now any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of friendship: "since the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is lovable to all," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore friendliness is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but a consequence of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 6) of this kind of friend that he "takes everything in a right manner both from those he loves and from those who are not his friends." Now it seems to pertain to simulation that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should show signs of friendship to those whom he loves not, and this is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore this kind of friendliness is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "observes the mean according as a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> decides" (Ethic. ii, 6). Now it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>): "The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth": wherefore "it belongs to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be most wary of pleasure" (Ethic. ii, 9). Now this kind of friendship, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 6), "is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> desirous of sharing pleasures, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to give pain." Therefore this kind of friendliness is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse7">Sirach 4:7</a>): "Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor." Therefore affability, which is what we mean by friendship, is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (109, 2; I-II, 55, 3), since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherever there is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there must needs be a special kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in order, as stated above (Question 109, Article 2). And it behooves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be maintained in a becoming order towards other men as regards their mutual relations with one another, in point of both <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, so that they behave towards one another in a becoming manner. Hence the need of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that maintains the becomingness of this order: and this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is called friendliness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of a twofold friendship in his Ethics. One consists chiefly in the affection whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves another and may result from any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. We have stated above, in treating of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> (23, 1, 3, ad 1; Q 25,26), what things belong to this kind of friendship. But he mentions another friendliness, which consists merely in outward words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; this has not the perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of friendship, but bears a certain likeness thereto, in so far as a man behaves in a becoming manner towards those with whom he is in contact.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> friend by a certain general love; even so it is written (<a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse19">Sirach 13:19</a>) that "every beast loveth its like." This love is signified by signs of friendship, which we show outwardly by words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, even to those who are strangers or unknown to us. Hence there is no dissimulation in this: because we do not show them signs of perfect friendship, for we do not treat strangers with the same intimacy as those who are united to us by special friendship.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When it is said that "the heart of the wise is where there is mourning" it is not that he may bring sorrow to his neighbor, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse15">Romans 14:15</a>): "If, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>": but that he may bring consolation to the sorrowful, according to <a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse38">Sirach 7:38</a>, "Be not wanting in comforting them that weep, and walk with them that mourn." Again, "the heart of fools is where there is mirth," not that they may gladden others, but that they may enjoy others' gladness. Accordingly, it belongs to the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to share his pleasures with those among whom he dwells, not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> pleasures, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> shuns, but honest pleasures, according to <a href="../bible/psa132.htm#verse1">Psalm 132:1</a>, "Behold how <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity."

<p>Nevertheless, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 6), for the sake of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that will result, or in order to avoid some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will sometimes not shrink from bringing sorrow to those among whom he lives. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>): "Although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent," and further on (<a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 7:9</a>), "I am glad; not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto repentance." For this reason we should not show a cheerful face to those who are given to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order that we may please them, lest we seem to consent to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in a way encourage them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> further. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse26">Sirach 7:26</a>): "Hast thou daughters? Have a care of their body, and show not thy countenance gay towards them."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this kind of friendship is a part of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this kind of friendship is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in giving another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his due. But this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not consist in doing that, but in behaving agreeably towards those among whom we live. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 6), this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned about the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a> and sorrows of those who dwell in fellowship. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to moderate the greatest pleasures, as stated above (I-II, 60, 5; I-II, 61, 3). Therefore this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to give equal things to those who are unequal is contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (59, 1 and 2). Now, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 6), this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "treats in like manner <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and unknown, companions and strangers." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than being a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is opposed thereto.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius (De Somno Scip. i) accounts friendship a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, being annexed to it as to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because in common with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it is directed to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is: yet it falls short of the notion of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because it lacks the full aspect of debt, whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to another, either by legal debt, which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> binds him to pay, or by some debt arising out of a favor received. For it regards merely a certain debt of equity, namely, that we behave pleasantly to those among whom we dwell, unless at times, for some reason, it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to displease them for some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As we have said above (109, 3, ad 1), because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a social animal he owes his fellow-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in equity, the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society could not last. Now as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could not live in society without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so likewise, not without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii), no one could abide a day with the sad nor with the joyless. Therefore, a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> equity <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> a man to live agreeably with his fellow-men; unless some reason should oblige him to sadden them for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to curb pleasures of the senses. But this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regards the pleasures of fellowship, which have their origin in the reason, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves becomingly towards another. Such pleasures need not to be curbed as though they were noisome.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> does not mean that one ought to converse and behave in the same way with acquaintances and strangers, since, as he says (Ethic. iv, 6), "it is not fitting to please and displease intimate friends and strangers in the same way." This likeness consists in this, that we ought to behave towards all in a fitting manner.
