<h1>Question 115. Flattery</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3115.htm#article1"> Is flattery a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3115.htm#article2"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether flattery is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that flattery is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For flattery consists in words of praise offered to another in order to please him. But it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to praise a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse28">Proverbs 31:28</a>, "Her children rose up and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her." Moreover, there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in wishing to please others, according to <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>, "I . . . in all things please all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Therefore flattery is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and blame to praise. But it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to blame <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Neither, then, is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to praise <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which seems to belong to flattery. Therefore flattery is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, detraction is contrary to flattery. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxii, 5) that detraction is a remedy against flattery. "It must be observed," says he, "that by the wonderful moderation of our Ruler, we are often allowed to be rent by detractions but are uplifted by immoderate praise, so that whom the voice of the flatterer upraises, the tongue of the detractor may <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>." But detraction is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (73, 2,3). Therefore flattery is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eze013.htm#verse18">Ezekiel 13:18</a>, "Woe to them that sew cushions under every elbow," says, "that is to say, sweet flattery." Therefore flattery is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (114, 1, ad 3), although the friendship of which we have been speaking, or affability, intends chiefly the pleasure of those among whom one lives, yet it does not fear to displease when it is a question of obtaining a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or of avoiding a certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Accordingly, if a man were to wish always to speak pleasantly to others, he would exceed the mode of pleasing, and would therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by excess. If he do this with the mere <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of pleasing he is said to be "complaisant," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 6): whereas if he do it with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of making some gain out of it, he is called a "flatterer" or "adulator." As a rule, however, the term "flattery" is wont to be applied to all who wish to exceed the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in pleasing others by words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in their ordinary behavior towards their fellows.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One may praise a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> both well and ill, according as one observes or omits the due circumstances. For if while observing other due circumstances one were to wish to please a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by praising him, in order thereby to console him, or that he may strive to make progress in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, this will belong to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of friendship. But it would belong to flattery, if one wished to praise a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for things in which he ought not to be praised; since perhaps they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse24">Psalm 9:24</a>, "The sinner is praised in the desires of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; or they may be uncertain, according to <a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse8">Sirach 27:8</a>, "Praise not a man before he speaketh," and again (<a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse2">Sirach 11:2</a>), "Praise not a man for his beauty"; or because there may be fear lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise should incite him to vainglory, wherefore it is written, (<a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse30">Sirach 11:30</a>), "Praise not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before death." Again, in like manner it is right to wish to please a man in order to foster <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that he may make <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> progress therein. But it would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to wish to please men for the sake of vainglory or gain, or to please them in something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa052.htm#verse6">Psalm 52:6</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath scattered the bones of them that please men," and according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians 1:10</a>), "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even to blame <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, if due circumstances be not observed; and so too is it to praise <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing hinders two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> being contrary to one another. Wherefore even as detraction is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so is flattery, which is contrary thereto as regards what is said, but not directly as regards the end. Because flattery seeks to please the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> flattered, whereas the detractor seeks not the displeasure of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> defamed, since at times he defames him in secret, but seeks rather his defamation.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether flattery is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that flattery is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion xii), "a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because it is harmful." But flattery is most harmful, according to <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse24">Psalm 9:24</a>, "For the sinner is praised in the desires of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is blessed. The sinner hath provoked the Lord." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Ep. ad Celant): "Nothing so easily corrupts the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind as flattery": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa069.htm#verse4">Psalm 69:4</a>, "Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: 'Tis well, 'Tis well," says: "The tongue of the flatterer harms more than the sword of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a>." Therefore flattery is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever does harm by words, harms himself no less than others: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse15">Psalm 36:15</a>): "Let their sword enter into their own hearts." Now he that flatters another induces him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally: hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse5">Psalm 140:5</a>, "Let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head," says: "The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> praise of the flatterer softens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by depriving it of the rigidity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and renders it susceptive of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." Much more, therefore, does the flatterer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written in the Decretals (D. XLVI, Cap. 3): "The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who shall be found to spend his time in flattery and treachery shall be degraded from his office." Now such a punishment as this is not inflicted save for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore flattery is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> (xli, de Sanctis) reckons among slight <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, "if one desire to flatter any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of higher standing, whether of one's own choice, or out of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 112, Article 2), a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now flattery is sometimes contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and sometimes not. It is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in three ways. First, by reason of the very <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> praises another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for this is contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against Whose <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> he speaks, and contrary to the love of his neighbor, whom he encourages to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore this is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah 5:20</a>. "Woe to you that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Secondly, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, as when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> flatters another, so that by deceiving him he may injure him in body or in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; this is also a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of this it is written (<a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse6">Proverbs 27:6</a>): "Better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of an enemy." Thirdly, by way of occasion, as when the praise of a flatterer, even without his intending it, becomes to another an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On this case it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to consider, whether the occasion were given or taken, and how grievous the consequent downfall, as may be understood from what has been said above concerning <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> (43, 3,4). If, however, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> flatters another from the mere craving to please others, or again in order to avoid some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or to acquire something in a case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, this is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently it is not a mortal but a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passages quoted speak of the flatterer who praises another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Flattery of this kind is said to harm more than the sword of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a>, since it does harm to goods that are of greater consequence. namely, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. Yet it does not harm so efficaciously, since the sword of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a> slays effectively, being a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death; whereas no one by flattering can be a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, as was shown above (43, 1, ad 3; I-II, 73, 8, ad 3; I-II, 80, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument applies to one that flatters with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of doing harm: for such a man harms himself more than others, since he harms himself, as the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, whereas he is only the occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the harm he does to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The passage quoted refers to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who flatters another treacherously, in order to deceive him.
