<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a body can be active?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no bodies are active. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 9): "There are things that are acted upon, but do not act; such are bodies: there is one Who acts but is not acted upon; this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: there are things that both act and are acted upon; these are the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every agent except the first agent requires in its work a subject susceptible of its action. But there is not <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> below the corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> which can be susceptible of the latter's action; since it belongs to the lowest degree of beings. Therefore corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not active.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is limited by <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> hinders <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> from movement and action, because it surrounds it and penetrates it: just as a cloud hinders the air from receiving light. A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is that the more a body increases in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, the heavier it is and the more difficult to move. Therefore no corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is active.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the power of action in every agent is according to its propinquity to the first active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But bodies, being most composite, are most remote from the first active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is most simple. Therefore no bodies are active.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if a body is an agent, the term of its action is either a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a>, or an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form. But it is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; for it is not possible to find in a body any principle of action, save an active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, which is an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; and an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> cannot be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is always more excellent than the effect. Likewise, neither is it an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form, for "an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> does not extend beyond its subject," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 4). Therefore no bodies are active.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. xv) that among other <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of corporeal fire, "it shows its greatness in its action and power on that of which it lays hold."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is apparent to the senses that some bodies are active. But concerning the action of bodies there have been three <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For some denied all action to bodies. This is the opinion of Avicebron in his book on The Fount of Life, where, by the arguments mentioned above, he endeavors to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that no bodies act, but that all the actions which seem to be the actions of bodies, are the actions of some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power that penetrates all bodies: so that, according to him, it is not fire that heats, but a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power which penetrates, by means of the fire. And this opinion seems to be derived from that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held that all forms <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are participated thereby, and determined and limited thereto; and that separate forms are absolute and as it were universal; wherefore he said that these separate forms are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of forms that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore inasmuch as the form which is in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is determined to this matter individualized by <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, Avicebron held that the corporeal form is held back and imprisoned by <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as the principle of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, so as to be unable by action to extend to any other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and immaterial form alone, which is not hedged in by <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, can issue forth by acting on something else.

<p>But this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the corporeal form is not an agent, but that it is not a universal agent. For in proportion as a thing is participated, so, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, must that be participated which is proper thereto; thus in proportion to the participation of light is the participation of visibility. But to act, which is nothing else than to make something to be in act, is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> proper to an act as such; wherefore every agent produces its like. So therefore to the fact of its being a form not determined by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, a thing owes its being an agent indeterminate and universal: but to the fact that it is determined to this matter, it owes its being an agent limited and particular. Wherefore if the form of fire were separate, as the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> supposed, it would be, in a fashion, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every ignition. But this form of fire which is in this corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this ignition which passes from this body to that. Hence such an action is effected by the contact of two bodies.

<p>But this opinion of Avicebron goes further than that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held only <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms to be separate; while he referred <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> to the material principles which are "the great" and "the small," which he considered to be the first contraries, by others considered to the "the rare" and "the dense." Consequently both <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, who follows him to a certain extent, held that corporeal agents act through their <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> forms, by disposing <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; but that the ultimate perfection attained by the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is due to an immaterial principle. And this is the second opinion concerning the action of bodies; of which we have spoken above when treating of the creation (45, 8).

<p>The third opinion is that of Democritus, who held that action takes place through the issue of atoms from the corporeal agent, while passion consists in the reception of the atoms in the pores of the passive body. This opinion is disproved by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Gener. i, 8,9). For it would follow that a body would not be passive as a whole, and the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the active body would be diminished through its action; which things are manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>.

<p>We must therefore say that a body acts forasmuch as it is in act, on a body forasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This passage of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be understood of the whole corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> considered as a whole, while thus has no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inferior to it, on which it can act; as the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> acts on the corporeal, and the uncreated <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>. Nevertheless one body is inferior to another, forasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to that which the other has in act.

<p>From this follows the solution of the second objection. But it must be observed, when Avicebron argues thus, "There is a mover who is not moved, to wit, the first maker of all; therefore, on the other hand, there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> something moved which is purely passive," that this is to be conceded. But this latter is primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is a pure <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. Now a body is composed of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act; and therefore it is both active and passive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">Quantity</a> does not entirely hinder the corporeal form from action, as stated above; but from being a universal agent, forasmuch as a form is individualized through being in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> taken from the weight of bodies is not to the purpose.

<p>First, because addition of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> weight; as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (De Coelo et Mundo iv, 2).

<p>Secondly, it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that weight retards movement; on the contrary, the heavier a thing, the greater its movement, if we consider the movement proper thereto.

<p>Thirdly, because action is not effected by local movement, as Democritus held: but by something being reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A body is not that which is most distant from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it participates something of a likeness to the Divine Being, forasmuch as it has a form. That which is most distant from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; which is in no way active, since it is a pure <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The term of a body's action is both an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form and a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form. For the active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, such as heat, although itself an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, acts nevertheless by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, as its instrument: wherefore its action can terminate in a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form; thus <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, as the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, has an action terminating in the generation of flesh. But by its own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it produces an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Nor is it against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> to surpass its subject in acting, but it is to surpass it in being; unless indeed one were to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> transfers its identical self from the agent to the patient; thus Democritus explained action by an issue of atoms.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there are any seminal virtues in corporeal matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are no seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [ratio] implies something of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> order. But in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> spiritually, but only materially, that is, according to the mode of that in which it is. Therefore there are no seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 8,9) says that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> produce certain results by employing with a hidden movement certain seeds, which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But bodies, not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, can be employed with local movement. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seeds are active principles. But there are no active principles in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; since, as we have said above, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not competent to act (1, ad 2,4). Therefore there are no seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there are said to be certain "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" (Augustine, De Gen. ad lit. v, 4) which seem to suffice for the production of things. But seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are outside the scope of seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but not of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8): "Of all the things which are generated in a corporeal and visible fashion, certain seeds lie hidden in the corporeal things of this world."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is customary to name things after what is more perfect, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4). Now in the whole corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, living bodies are the most perfect: wherefore the word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" has been transferred from living things to all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. For the word itself, "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, Did. iv, 4), was first applied to signify the generation of living things, which is called "nativity": and because living things are generated from a principle united to them, as fruit from a tree, and the offspring from the mother, to whom it is united, consequently the word "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" has been applied to every principle of movement <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in that which is moved. Now it is manifest that the active and passive principles of the generation of living things are the seeds from which living things are generated. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> fittingly gave the name of "seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" [seminales rationes] to all those active and passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> generation and movement.

<p>These active and passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be considered in several orders. For in the first place, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. vi, 10), they are principally and originally in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as "typal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>."

<p>Secondly, they are in the elements of the world, where they were produced altogether at the beginning, as in "universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>."

<p>Thirdly, they are in those things which, in the succession of time, are produced by universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, for instance in this plant, and in that animal, as in "particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>."

<p>Fourthly, they are in the "seeds" produced from animals and plants. And these again are compared to further particular effects, as the primordial universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to the first effects produced.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These active and passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, thought not called "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>" [rationes] by reason of their being in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, can nevertheless be so called in respect of their origin, forasmuch as they are the effect of the typal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> [rationes ideales].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These active and passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in certain parts of corporeal things: and when they are employed with local movement for the production of certain results, we speak of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as employing seeds.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The seed of the male is the active principle in the generation of an animal. But that can be called seed also which the female contributes as the passive principle. And thus the word "seed" covers both active and passive principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> From the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> when speaking of these seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it is easy to gather that they are also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, just as seed is a kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for he says (De Trin. iii, 9) that, "as a mother is pregnant with the unborn offspring, so is the world itself pregnant with the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of unborn things." Nevertheless, the "typal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>" can be called "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," but not, strictly speaking, "seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>," because seed is not a separate principle; and because <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not wrought outside the scope of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Likewise neither are <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought outside the scope of the passive <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> so implanted in the creature, that the latter can be used to any purpose that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands. But <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are said to be wrought outside the scope of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the passive potentialities which are ordered to such active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and this is what is meant when we say that they are wrought outside the scope of seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the heavenly bodies are the cause of what is produced in bodies here below?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the heavenly bodies are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what is produced in bodies here below. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 7): "We say that they"--namely, the heavenly bodies--"are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of generation or corruption: they are rather signs of storms and atmospheric changes."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, for the production of anything, an agent and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> suffice. But in things here below there is passive <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and there are contrary agents--heat and cold, and the like. Therefore for the production of things here below, there is no need to ascribe <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> to the heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the agent produces its like. Now it is to be observed that everything which is produced here below is produced through the action of heat and cold, moisture and dryness, and other such <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, which do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in heavenly bodies. Therefore the heavenly bodies are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what is produced here below.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 6): "Nothing is more corporeal than sex." But sex is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the heavenly bodies: a sign of this is that of twins born under the same constellation, one may be male, the other female. Therefore the heavenly bodies are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things produced in bodies here below.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4): "Bodies of a grosser and inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are ruled in a certain order by those of a more subtle and powerful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." And <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) says that "the light of the sun conduces to the generation of sensible bodies, moves them to life, gives them nourishment, growth, and perfection."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since every multitude proceeds from unity; and since what is immovable is always in the same way of being, whereas what is moved has many ways of being: it must be observed that throughout the whole of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, all movement proceeds from the immovable. Therefore the more immovable certain things are, the more are they the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those things which are most movable. Now the heavenly bodies are of all bodies the most immovable, for they are not moved save locally. Therefore the movements of bodies here below, which are various and multiform, must be referred to the movement of the heavenly bodies, as to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> are to be understood as denying that the heavenly bodies are the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of generation and corruption here below; for this was affirmed by those who held that the heavenly bodies are gods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The active principles of bodies here below are only the active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a> of the elements, such as hot and cold and the like. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms of inferior bodies were not diversified save according to <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of that kind, the principles of which the early <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held to be the "rare" and the "dense"; there would be no need to suppose some principle above these inferior bodies, for they would be of themselves sufficient to act. But to anyone who considers the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> aright, it is clear that those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> are merely material dispositions in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies. Now <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not of itself sufficient to act. And therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose some active principle above these material dispositions.

<p>This is why the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> maintained the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by participation of which the inferior bodies receive their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> forms. But this does not seem enough. For the separate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since they are supposed to be immovable, would always have the same mode of being: and consequently there would be no variety in the generation and corruption of inferior bodies: which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. ii, 10), to suppose a movable principle, which by reason of its presence or absence <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> variety in the generation and corruption of inferior bodies. Such are the heavenly bodies. Consequently whatever generates here below, moves to the production of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as the instrument of a heavenly body: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. ii, 2) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the sun generate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The heavenly bodies have not a specific likeness to the bodies here below. Their likeness consists in this, that by reason of their universal power, whatever is generated in inferior bodies, is contained in them. In this way also we say that all things are like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The actions of heavenly bodies are variously received in inferior bodies, according to the various dispositions of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now it happens at times that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception is not wholly disposed to the male sex; wherefore it is formed sometimes into a male, sometimes into a female. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quotes this as an argument against <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by stars: because the effects of the stars are varied even in corporeal things, according to the various dispositions of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. For since the heavenly bodies are moved by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, as stated above (Question 110, Article 3), they act by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thereof as their instruments. But those <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> are superior to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Therefore it seems that they can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> impressions on our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and thereby <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every multiform is reducible to a uniform principle. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are various and multiform. Therefore it seems that they are reducible to the uniform movements of heavenly bodies, as to their principles.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, astrologers often foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the outcome of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, of which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will are the principles. But they could not do this by means of the heavenly bodies, unless these were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions. Therefore the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 7) that "the heavenly bodies are by no means the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The heavenly bodies can directly and of themselves act on bodies, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). They can act directly indeed on those powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which are the acts of corporeal organs, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: because the acts of such powers must needs be hindered by obstacles in the organs; thus an eye when disturbed cannot see well. Wherefore if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will were powers affixed to corporeal organs, as some maintained, holding that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not differ from sense; it would follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> choice and action. It would also follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is led by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> instinct to his actions, just as other animals, in which there are powers other than those which are affixed to corporeal organs: for whatever is done here below in virtue of the action of heavenly bodies, is done <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. It would therefore follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and that he would have determinate actions, like other <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. All of which is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. It must be observed, however, that indirectly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, the impressions of heavenly bodies can reach the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, forasmuch, namely, as both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will receive something from the inferior powers which are affixed to corporeal organs. But in this the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will are differently situated. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, receives from the inferior apprehensive powers: wherefore if the imaginative, cogitative, or memorative powers be disturbed, the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, disturbed also. The will, on the contrary, does not, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, follow the inclination of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; for although the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> have a certain force in inclining the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> retains the power of following the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or repressing them. Therefore the impressions of the heavenly bodies, by virtue of which the inferior powers can be changed, has less influence on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, than on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>To maintain therefore that heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions is proper to those who hold that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not differ from sense. Wherefore some of these said that "such is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as is the day which the father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of gods brings on" (Odyssey xviii 135). Since, therefore, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will are not acts of corporeal organs, it is impossible that heavenly bodies be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, that move the heavenly bodies, do indeed act on corporeal things by means of the heavenly bodies; but they act immediately on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by enlightening it. On the other hand, they cannot compel the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 111, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the multiformity of corporeal movements is reducible to the uniformity of the heavenly movement as to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: so the multiformity of actions proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is reduced to a uniform principle which is the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The majority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> follow their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in which movements of the heavenly bodies can cooperate: but few are wise enough to resist these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Consequently astrologers are able to foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the majority of cases, especially in a general way. But not in particular cases; for nothing prevents <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> resisting his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Wherefore the astrologers themselves are wont to say that "the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is stronger than the stars" [Ptolemy, Centiloquium, prop. 5], forasmuch as, to wit, he conquers his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether heavenly bodies can act on the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that heavenly bodies can act on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to certain phases of the moon, can harass men, who on that account are called lunatics, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse24">Matthew 4:24</a> and <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse14">17:14</a>. But this would not be if they were not subject to the heavenly bodies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject to them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, necromancers observe certain constellations in order to invoke the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But these would not be invoked through the heavenly bodies unless they were subject to them. Therefore they are subject to them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, heavenly bodies are more powerful than inferior bodies. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are confined to certain inferior bodies, namely, "herbs, stones, animals, and to certain sounds and words, forms and figures," as Porphyry says, quoted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 11). Much more therefore are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> subject to the action of heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are superior in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to the heavenly bodies. But the "agent is superior to the patient," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not subject to the action of heavenly bodies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There have been three opinions about the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. In the first place the Peripatetics denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and held that what is ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to the necromantic art, is effected by the power of the heavenly bodies. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 11) relates as having been held by Porphyry, namely, that "on earth men fabricate certain powers useful in producing certain effects of the stars." But this opinion is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience that many things are done by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, for which the power of heavenly bodies would in no way suffice: for instance, that a man in a state of delirium should speak an unknown tongue, recite poetry and authors of whom he has no previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; that necromancers make statues to speak and move, and other like things.

<p>For this reason the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> were led to hold that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are "animals with an aerial body and a passive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," as Apuleius says, quoted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei viii, 16). And this is the second of the opinions mentioned above: according to which it could be said that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject to heavenly bodies in the same way as we have said <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject thereto (4). But this opinion is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> from what we have said above (Question 51, Article 1): for we hold that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> not united to bodies. Hence it is clear that they are subject to the action of heavenly bodies neither <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> nor <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, neither directly nor indirectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> harass men, according to certain phases of the moon, happens in two ways.

<p>Firstly, they do so in order to "defame <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creature," namely, the moon; as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (In Matt. iv, 24) and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. lvii in Matt.) say.

<p>Secondly, because as they are unable to effect anything save by means of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces, as stated above (114, 4, ad 2) they take into account the aptitude of bodies for the intended result. Now it is manifest that "the brain is the most moist of all the parts of the body," as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says [De Part. Animal. ii, 7: De Sens. et Sensato ii: De Somn. et Vigil. iii]: wherefore it is the most subject to the action of the moon, the property of which is to move what is moist. And it is precisely in the brain that animal forces culminate: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, according to certain phases of the moon, disturb <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, when they observe that the brain is thereto disposed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Demons when summoned through certain constellations, come for two reasons.

<p>Firstly, in order to lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that there is some Divine power in the stars.

<p>Secondly, because they consider that under certain constellations corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is better disposed for the result for which they are summoned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 6), the "<a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are enticed through various kinds of stones, herbs, trees, animals, songs, rites, not as an animal is enticed by food, but as a spirit by signs"; that is to say, forasmuch as these things are offered to them in token of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which they are covetous.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether heavenly bodies impose necessity on things subject to their action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that heavenly bodies impose <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> on things subject to their action. For given a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But heavenly bodies are a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their effects. Since, therefore, heavenly bodies, with their movements and dispositions, are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> beings; it seems that their effects follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an agent's effect results of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, when the power of the agent is such that it can subject the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to itself entirely. But the entire <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of inferior bodies is subject to the power of heavenly bodies, since this is a higher power than theirs. Therefore the effect of the heavenly bodies is of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> received in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the effect of the heavenly body does not follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, this is due to some hindering <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But any corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that might possibly hinder the effect of a heavenly body, must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be reducible to some heavenly principle: since the heavenly bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of all that takes place here below. Therefore, since also that heavenly principle is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, it follows that the effect of the heavenly body is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> hindered. Consequently it would follow that all that takes place here below happens of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil. [De Divin. per Somn. ii): "It is not incongruous that many of the signs observed in bodies, of occurrences in the heavens, such as rain and wind, should not be fulfilled." Therefore not all the effects of heavenly bodies take place of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This question is partly solved by what was said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>); and in part presents some difficulty. For it was shown that although the action of heavenly bodies produces certain inclinations in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> nevertheless does not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> follow these inclinations. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the effect of heavenly bodies being hindered by the action of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, but also in other things to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> action extends.

<p>But in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things there is no such principle, endowed with freedom to follow or not to follow the impressions produced by heavenly agents. Wherefore it seems that in such things at least, everything happens of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; according to the reasoning of some of the ancients who supposing that everything that is, has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and that, given the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; concluded that all things happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. This opinion is refuted by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Metaph. vi, Did. v, 3) as to this double supposition.

<p>For in the first place it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, given any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever, the effect must follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are so ordered to their effects, as to produce them, not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but in the majority of cases, and in the minority to fail in producing them. But that such cases do fail in the minority of cases is due to some hindering <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; consequently the above-mentioned difficulty seems not to be avoided, since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in question is hindered of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p>Therefore we must say, in the second place, that everything that is a being "per se," has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, has not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a being, since it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> one. For (that a thing is) "white" has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, likewise (that a man is) "musical" has not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but (that a being is) "white-musical" has not a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, because it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a being, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> one. Now it is manifest that a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which hinders the action of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> so ordered to its effect as to produce it in the majority of cases, clashes sometimes with this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: and the clashing of these two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Consequently what results from this clashing of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is not to be reduced to a further pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from which it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For instance, that some terrestrial body take fire in the higher regions of the air and fall to the earth, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by some heavenly power: again, that there be on the surface of the earth some combustible <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is reducible to some heavenly principle. But that the burning body should alight on this matter and set fire to it, is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by a heavenly body, but is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Consequently not all the effects of heavenly bodies result of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The heavenly bodies are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of effects that take place here below, through the means of particular inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which can fail in their effects in the minority of cases.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The power of a heavenly body is not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Wherefore it requires a determinate disposition in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, both as to local distance and as to other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, in order to produce its effect. Therefore as local distance hinders the effect of a heavenly body (for the sun has not the same effect in heat in Dacia as in <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>); so the grossness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, its low or high temperature or other such disposition, can hinder the effect of a heavenly body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that hinders the effect of another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can be reduced to a heavenly body as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; nevertheless the clashing of two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, being <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, is not reduced to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of a heavenly body, as stated above.
