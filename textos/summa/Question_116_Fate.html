<h1>Question 116. Fate</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1116.htm#article1"> Is there such a thing as fate?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1116.htm#article2"> Where is it?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1116.htm#article3"> Is it unchangeable?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1116.htm#article4"> Are all things subject to fate?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there be such a thing as fate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fate is nothing. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for the Epiphany (Hom. x in Evang.): "Far be it from the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to think that fate is anything real."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what happens by fate is not unforeseen, for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 4), "fate is understood to be derived from the verb 'fari' which means to speak"; as though things were said to happen by fate, which are "fore-spoken" by one who decrees them to happen. Now what is foreseen is neither lucky nor chance-like. If therefore things happen by fate, there will be neither luck nor chance in the world.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> cannot be defined. But <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (De Consol. iv) defines fate thus: "Fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things, by which Providence connects each one with its proper order."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In this world some things seem to happen by luck or chance. Now it happens sometimes that something is lucky or chance-like as compared to inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which, if compared to some higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is directly intended. For instance, if two servants are sent by their master to the same place; the meeting of the two servants in regard to themselves is by chance; but as compared to the master, who had ordered it, it is directly intended.

<p>So there were some who refused to refer to a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> such events which by luck or chance take place here below. These denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of fate and Providence, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates of Tully (De Civ. Dei v, 9). And this is contrary to what we have said above about Providence (22, 2).

<p>On the other hand, some have considered that everything that takes place here below by luck or by chance, whether in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things or in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, is to be reduced to a superior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, namely, the heavenly bodies. According to these fate is nothing else than "a disposition of the stars under which each one is begotten or born" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> De Civ. Dei v, 1,8,9. But this will not hold.

<p>First, as to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs: because we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 115, Article 4) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions are not subject to the action of heavenly bodies, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and indirectly. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fate, since it has the ordering of things that happen by fate, must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> be directly and of itself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what takes place.

<p>Secondly, as to all things that happen <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>: for it has been said (115, 6) that what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, is properly speaking neither a being, nor a unity. But every action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> terminates in some one thing. Wherefore it is impossible for that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to be the proper effect of an active <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principle. No <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> can therefore have for its proper effect that a man intending to dig a grave finds a treasure. Now it is manifest that a heavenly body acts after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principle: wherefore its effects in this world are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. It is therefore impossible that any active power of a heavenly body be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what happens by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> here below, whether by luck or by chance.

<p>We must therefore say that what happens here by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things and in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, is reduced to a preordaining <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is Divine Providence. For nothing hinders that which happens by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> being considered as one by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>: otherwise the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> could not form this proposition: "The digger of a grave found a treasure." And just as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can apprehend this so can it effect it; for instance, someone who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a place where a treasure is hidden, might instigate a rustic, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, to dig a grave there. Consequently, nothing hinders what happens here by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, by luck or by chance, being reduced to some ordering <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which acts by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, especially the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can change the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as shown above (Question 105, Article 4). Consequently the ordering of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, the principle of which is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, must be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p>So therefore inasmuch as all that happens here below is subject to Divine Providence, as being pre-ordained, and as it were "fore-spoken," we can admit the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of fate: although the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> avoided the use of this word, on account of those who twisted its application to a certain force in the position of the stars. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 1): "If anyone ascribes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs to fate, meaning thereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him keep to his opinion, but hold his tongue." For this reason <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> denies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of fate: wherefore the first objection's solution is manifest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders certain things happening by luck or by chance, if compared to their proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>: but not if compared to Divine Providence, whereby "nothing happens at random in the world," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 24).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fate is in created things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fate is not in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 1) that the "Divine will or power is called fate." But the Divine will or power is not in creatures, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore fate is not in creatures but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fate is compared to things that happen by fate, as their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; as the very use of the word proves. But the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that of itself effects what takes place by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> here below, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore fate is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not in creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if fate is in creatures, it is either a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>: and whichever it is it must be multiplied according to the number of creatures. Since, therefore, fate seems to be one thing only, it seems that fate is not in creatures, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv): "Fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is clear from what has been stated above (22, 3; 103, 6), Divine Providence produces effects through mediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. We can therefore consider the ordering of the effects in two ways.

<p>Firstly, as being in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: and thus the ordering of the effects is called Providence. But if we consider this ordering as being in the mediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> ordered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the production of certain effects, thus it has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fate. This is what <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv): "Fate is worked out when Divine Providence is served by certain spirits; whether by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or by all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself which obeys Him, whether by the heavenly movements of the stars, whether by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> power, or by the ingenuity of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whether by some of these, or by all, the chain of fate is forged." Of each of these things we have spoken above (1; 104, 2; 110, 1; 113; 114). It is therefore manifest that fate is in the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> themselves, as ordered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the production of their effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The ordering itself of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei v, 8) calls the "series of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>," has not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fate, except as dependent on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the Divine power or will can be called fate, as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fate. But <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> fate is the very disposition or "series," i.e. order, of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fate has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, just as much as the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> themselves, the ordering of which is called fate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fate is called a disposition, not that disposition which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but in the sense in which it signifies order, which is not a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but a relation. And if this order be considered in relation to its principle, it is one; and thus fate is one. But if it be considered in relation to its effects, or to the mediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, this fate is multiple. In this sense the poet wrote: "Thy fate draws thee."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fate is unchangeable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fate is not unchangeable. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv): "As reasoning is to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the begotten is to that which is, as time to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, as the circle to its centre; so is the fickle chain of fate to the unwavering simplicity of Providence."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii, 7): "If we be moved, what is in us is moved." But fate is a "disposition inherent to changeable things," as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv). Therefore fate is changeable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if fate is unchangeable, what is subject to fate happens unchangeably and of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But things ascribed to fate seem principally to be contingencies. Therefore there would be no contingencies in the world, but all things would happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv) that fate is an unchangeable disposition.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The disposition of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> which we call fate, can be considered in two ways: firstly, in regard to the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, which are thus disposed or ordered; secondly, in regard to the first principle, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whom they are ordered. Some, therefore, have held that the series itself or dispositions of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is in itself <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, so that all things would happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; for this reason that each effect has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and given a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the effect must follow of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 115, Article 6).

<p>Others, on the other hand, held that fate is changeable, even as dependent on Divine Providence. Wherefore the Egyptians said that fate could be changed by certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> says (Nemesius, De Homine). This too has been disproved above for the reason that it is repugnant to Divine Providence.

<p>We must therefore say that fate, considered in regard to second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, is changeable; but as subject to Divine Providence, it derives a certain unchangeableness, not of absolute but of conditional <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. In this sense we say that this conditional is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>: "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that this would happen, it will happen." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, having said that the chain of fate is fickle, shortly afterwards adds--"which, since it is derived from an unchangeable Providence must also itself be unchangeable."

<p>From this the answers to the objections are clear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all things are subject to fate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that all things are subject to fate. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv): "The chain of fate moves the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the stars, tempers the elements to one another, and models them by a reciprocal transformation. By fate all things that are born into the world and perish are renewed in a uniform progression of offspring and seed." Nothing therefore seems to be excluded from the domain of fate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 1) that fate is something real, as referred to the Divine will and power. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things that happen, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 1 seqq.). Therefore all things are subject to fate.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv) that fate "is a disposition inherent to changeable things." But all creatures are changeable, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> unchangeable, as stated above (Question 9, Article 2). Therefore fate is in all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv) that "some things subject to Providence are above the ordering of fate."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), fate is the ordering of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to effects foreseen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whatever, therefore, is subject to second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, is subject also to fate. But whatever is done immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is not subject to second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, neither is it subject to fate; such are creation, the glorification of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, and the like. And this is what <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iv): viz. that "those things which are nigh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have a state of immobility, and exceed the changeable order of fate." Hence it is clear that "the further a thing is from the First Mind, the more it is involved in the chain of fate"; since so much the more it is bound up with second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All the things mentioned in this passage are done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; for this reason they are contained in the order of fate. But it is not the same with everything else, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fate is to be referred to the Divine will and power, as to its first principle. Consequently it does not follow that whatever is subject to the Divine will or power, is subject also to fate, as already stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although all creatures are in some way changeable, yet some of them do not proceed from changeable <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. And these, therefore, are not subject to fate, as stated above.
