<h1>Question 116. Quarreling</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3116.htm#article1"> Is it opposed to the virtue of friendship?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3116.htm#article2"> Its comparison with flattery</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether quarreling is opposed to the virtue of friendship or affability?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that quarreling is not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of friendship or affability. For quarreling seems to pertain to discord, just as contention does. But discord is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 37, Article 1). Therefore quarreling is also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse21">Proverbs 26:21</a>): "An <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stirreth up strife." Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is opposed to meekness. Therefore strife or quarreling is also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse1">James 4:1</a>): "From whence are <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and quarrels [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'contentions'] among you? Are they not hence, from your <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> which war in your members?" Now it would seem contrary to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to follow one's <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>. Therefore it seems that quarreling is opposed not to friendship but to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> opposes quarreling to friendship (Ethic. iv, 6).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Quarreling consists properly in words, when, namely, one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> contradicts another's words. Now two things may be observed in this contradiction. For sometimes contradiction arises on account of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who speaks, the contradictor refusing to consent with him from lack of that love which unites minds together, and this seems to pertain to discord, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Whereas at times contradiction arises by reason of the speaker being a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom someone does not fear to be disagreeable: whence arises quarreling, which is opposed to the aforesaid friendship or affability, to which it belongs to behave agreeably towards those among whom we dwell. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 6) that "those who are opposed to everything with the intent of being disagreeable, and care for nobody, are said to be peevish and quarrelsome."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Contention pertains rather to the contradiction of discord, while quarreling belongs to the contradiction which has the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of displeasing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The direct opposition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> depends, not on their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, since one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may arise from many <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but on the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of their acts. And although quarreling arises at times from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, it may arise from many other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, hence it does not follow that it is directly opposed to meekness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> James speaks there of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> considered as a general <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whence all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise. Thus, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans 7:7</a> says: "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since by forbidding <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, it forbids all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether quarreling is a more grievous sin than flattery?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that quarreling is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, viz. adulation or flattery. For the more harm a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does the more grievous it seems to be. Now flattery does more harm than quarreling, for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse12">Isaiah 3:12</a>): "O My people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps." Therefore flattery is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than quarreling.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there appears to be a certain amount of deceit in flattery, since the flatterer says one thing, and thinks another: whereas the quarrelsome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is without deceit, for he contradicts openly. Now he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deceitfully is a viler <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 6). Therefore flattery is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than quarreling.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, shame is fear of what is vile, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 9). But a man is more ashamed to be a flatterer than a quarreler. Therefore quarreling is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than flattery.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state, the more it appears to be grievous. Now quarreling seems to be more inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> state: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2-3</a>) that it "behooveth a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be . . . not quarrelsome"; and (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2 Timothy 3:24</a>): "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle." Therefore quarreling seems to be a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than flattery.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can speak of each of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in two ways. On one way we may consider the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of either <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus the more a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is at variance with the opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the more grievous it is. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of friendship has a greater tendency to please than to displease: and so the quarrelsome <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who exceeds in giving displeasure <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously than the adulator or flatterer, who exceeds in giving pleasure. On another way we may consider them as regards certain external motives, and thus flattery sometimes more grievous, for instance when one intends by deception to acquire undue <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or gain: while sometimes quarreling is more grievous; for instance, when one intends either to deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or to hold up the speaker to contempt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the flatterer may do harm by deceiving secretly, so the quarreler may do harm sometimes by assailing openly. Now, other things being equal, it is more grievous to harm a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> openly, by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> as it were, than secretly. Wherefore robbery is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, as stated above (Question 66, Article 09).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the more grievous is not always the more vile. For the comeliness of a man has its source in his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, whereby the flesh enslaves the reason, are viler, although <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more grievous, since they proceed from greater contempt. On like manner, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed through deceit are viler, in so far as they seem to arise from a certain weakness, and from a certain falseness of the reason, although <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed openly proceed sometimes from a greater contempt. Hence flattery, through being accompanied by deceit, seems to be a viler <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; while quarreling, through proceeding from greater contempt, is apparently more grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in the objection, shame regards the vileness of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; wherefore a man is not always more ashamed of a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of a viler <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it is that a man is more ashamed of flattery than of quarreling, although quarreling is more grievous.
