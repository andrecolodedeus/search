<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether liberality is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that liberality is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination. Now it is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination for one to provide for oneself more than for others: and yet it pertains to the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to do the contrary, since, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1), "it is the mark of a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not to look to himself, so that he leaves for himself the lesser things." Therefore liberality is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sustains life by means of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> contributes to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> instrumentally, as stated in Ethic. i, 8. Since, then, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it seems that the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says of him (Ethic. iv, 1) that "he is inclined neither to receive nor to keep money, but to give it away."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected with one another. But liberality does not seem to be connected with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since many are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> who cannot be liberal, for they have nothing to give; and many give or spend liberally who are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> otherwise. Therefore liberality is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "the Gospel contains many instances in which a just liberality is inculcated." Now in the Gospel nothing is taught that does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore liberality is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19), "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to use well the things that we can use ill." Now we may use both well and ill, not only the things that are within us, such as the powers and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also those that are without, such as the things of this world that are granted us for our livelihood. Wherefore since it belongs to liberality to use these things well, it follows that liberality is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Serm. lxiv de Temp.) and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> (Hom. in Luc. xii, 18) excess of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to some, in order that they may obtain the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stewardship. But it suffices for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have few things. Wherefore the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> commendably spends more on others than on himself. Nevertheless we are bound to be more provident for ourselves in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods, in which each one is able to look after himself in the first place. And yet it does not belong to the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even in temporal things to attend so much to others as to lose sight of himself and those belonging to him. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "It is a commendable liberality not to neglect your relatives if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be in want."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It does not belong to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so to give away his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> that nothing is left for his own support, nor the wherewithal to perform those acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is acquired. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not neglect his own, wishing thus to be of help to certain people"; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> does not wish a man to pour out his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> all at once, but to dispense them: unless he do as Eliseus did, who slew his oxen and fed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that he might not be bound by any household cares." For this belongs to the state of perfection, of which we shall speak farther on (184,186, 3).

<p>It must be observed, however, that the very act of giving away one's possessions liberally, in so far as it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is directed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1), "those who spend much on intemperance are not liberal but prodigal"; and likewise whoever spends what he has for the sake of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "If you assist to rob others of their possessions, your honesty is not to be commended, nor is your liberality genuine if you give for the sake of boasting rather than of pity." Wherefore those who lack other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, though they spend much on certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, are not liberal.

<p>Again, nothing hinders certain people from spending much on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> uses, without having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of liberality: even as men perform works of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, before having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though not in the same way as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> people, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). On like manner nothing prevents a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from being liberal, although he be poor. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1): "Liberality is proportionate to a man's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," i.e. his means, "for it consists, not in the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> given, but in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the giver": and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "it is the heart that makes a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> rich or poor, and gives things their value."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether liberality is about money?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that liberality is not about money. For every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about operations and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now it is proper to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be about operations, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Therefore, since liberality is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it seems that it is about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and not about money.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to make use of any kind of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are more real than artificial <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Polit. i, 5,6). Therefore liberality is not chiefly about money.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have different <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their objects. But external things are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of distributive and commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore they are not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "liberality seems to be a mean in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of money."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1) it belongs to the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to part with things. Hence liberality is also called open-handedness [largitas], because that which is open does not withhold things but parts of them. The term "liberality" seems also to allude to this, since when a man quits hold of a thing he frees it [liberat], so to speak, from his keeping and ownership, and shows his mind to be free of attachment thereto. Now those things which are the subject of a man's free-handedness towards others are the goods he possesses, which are denoted by the term "money." Therefore the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality is money.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 3), liberality depends not on the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> given, but on the heart of the giver. Now the heart of the giver is disposed according to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of love and desire, and consequently those of pleasure and sorrow, towards the things given. Hence the interior <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are the immediate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality, while exterior money is the object of those same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his book De Disciplina Christi (Tract. de divers, i), everything whatsoever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has on earth, and whatsoever he owns, goes by the name of "'pecunia' [money], because in olden times men's possessions consisted entirely of 'pecora' [flocks]." And the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1): "We give the name of money to anything that can be valued in currency."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Justice establishes equality in external things, but has nothing to do, properly speaking, with the regulation of internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: wherefore money is in one way the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality, and in another way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether using money is the act of liberality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that using money is not the act of liberality. For different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have different acts. But using money is becoming to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and magnificence. Therefore it is not the proper act of liberality.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only to give but also to receive and keep. But receiving and keeping do not seem to be connected with the use of money. Therefore using money seems to be unsuitably assigned as the proper act of liberality.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the use of money consists not only in giving it but also in spending it. But the spending of money refers to the spender, and consequently is not an act of liberality: for Seneca says (De Benef. v): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not liberal by giving to himself." Therefore not every use of money belongs to liberality.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1): "In whatever <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> a man is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, he will make the best use of that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: Therefore he that has the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with regard to money will make the best use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>." Now such is the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of money is the act of liberality.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of an act is taken from its object, as stated above (I-II, 18, 2). Now the object or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality is money and whatever has a money value, as stated in the foregoing Article (ad 2). And since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is consistent with its object, it follows that, since liberality is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, its act is consistent with money. Now money comes under the head of useful goods, since all external goods are directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use. Hence the proper act of liberality is making use of money or <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to liberality to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> as such, because <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality. On the other hand it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to make use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> under another aspect, namely, that of debt, in so far as an external thing is due to another. And it belongs to magnificence to make use of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> under a special aspect, in so far, to wit, as they are employed for the fulfilment of some great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. Hence magnificence stands in relation to liberality as something in addition thereto, as we shall explain farther on (134).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not only to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of his <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or instrument, but also to provide opportunities for that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use. Thus it belongs to a soldier's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> not only to wield his sword against the foe, but also to sharpen his sword and keep it in its sheath. Thus, too, it belongs to liberality not only to use money, but also to keep it in preparation and safety in order to make fitting use of it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated (2, ad 1), the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is affected towards money are the proximate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality. Hence it belongs to liberality before all that a man should not be prevented from making any due use of money through an inordinate affection for it. Now there is a twofold use of money: one consists in applying it to one's own use, and would seem to come under the designation of costs or expenditure; while the other consists in devoting it to the use of others, and comes under the head of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Hence it belongs to liberality that one be not hindered by an immoderate love of money, either from spending it becomingly, or from making suitable <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>. Therefore liberality is concerned with giving and spending, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1). The saying of Seneca refers to liberality as regards giving: for a man is not said to be liberal for the reason that he gives something to himself.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether it belongs to a liberal man chiefly to give?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it does not belong to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chiefly to give. For liberality, like all other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, is regulated by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Now it seems to belong very much to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that a man should keep his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "those who have not earned money, but have received the money earned by others, spend it more liberally, because they have not experienced the want of it." Therefore it seems that giving does not chiefly belong to the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sorry for what he intends chiefly to do, nor does he cease from doing it. But a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is sometimes sorry for what he has given, nor does he give to all, as stated in Ethic. iv, 1. Therefore it does not belong chiefly to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to give.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in order to accomplish what he intends chiefly, a man employs all the ways he can. Now a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a beggar, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iv, 1); and yet by begging he might provide himself with the means of giving to others. Therefore it seems that he does not chiefly aim at giving.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to look after himself rather than others. But by spending he looks after himself, whereas by giving he looks after others. Therefore it belongs to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to spend rather than to give.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "it belongs to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to surpass in giving."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is proper to a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to use money. Now the use of money consists in parting with it. For the acquisition of money is like generation rather than use: while the keeping of money, in so far as it is directed to facilitate the use of money, is like a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now in parting with a thing --for instance, when we throw something--the farther we put it away the greater the force [virtus] employed. Hence parting with money by giving it to others proceeds from a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than when we spend it on ourselves. But it is proper to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as such to tend to what is more perfect, since "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a kind of perfection" (Phys. vii, text. 17,18). Therefore a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is praised chiefly for giving.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to keep money, lest it be stolen or spent uselessly. But to spend it usefully is not less but more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> than to keep it usefully: since more things have to be considered in money's use, which is likened to movement, than in its keeping, which is likened to rest. As to those who, having received money that others have earned, spend it more liberally, through not having experienced the want of it, if their inexperience is the sole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their liberal expenditure they have not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of liberality. Sometimes, however, this inexperience merely removes the impediment to liberality, so that it makes them all the more ready to act liberally, because, not unfrequently, the fear of want that results from the experience of want hinders those who have acquired money from using it up by acting with liberality; as does likewise the love they have for it as being their own effect, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in this and the preceding Article, it belongs to liberality to make fitting use of money, and consequently to give it in a fitting manner, since this is a use of money. Again, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is grieved by whatever is contrary to its act, and avoids whatever hinders that act. Now two things are opposed to suitable giving; namely, not giving what ought suitably to be given, and giving something unsuitably. Wherefore the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is grieved at both: but especially at the former, since it is more opposed to his proper act. For this reason, too, he does not give to all: since his act would be hindered were he to give to everyone: for he would not have the means of giving to those to whom it were fitting for him to give.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Giving and receiving are related to one another as action and passion. Now the same thing is not the principle of both action and passion. Hence, since liberality is a principle of giving, it does not belong to the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be ready to receive, and still less to beg. Hence the verse:

<p>'In this world he that wishes to be pleasing to many Should give often, take seldom, ask never.' But he makes provision in order to give certain things according as liberality requires; such are the fruits of his own possessions, for he is careful about realizing them that he may make a liberal use thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To spend on oneself is an inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; hence to spend money on others belongs properly to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether liberality is a part of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that liberality is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards that which is due. Now the more a thing is due the less liberally is it given. Therefore liberality is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but is incompatible with it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is about operation as stated above (58, 09; I-II, 60, 2,3): whereas liberality is chiefly about the love and desire of money, which are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore liberality seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs chiefly to liberality to give becomingly, as stated (4). But giving becomingly belongs to beneficence and mercy, which pertain to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as state above (30,31). Therefore liberality is a part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "Justice has to do with the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. For the notion of fellowship is divided into two parts, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and beneficence, also called liberality or kind-heartedness." Therefore liberality pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Liberality is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pays another what is his whereas liberality gives another what is one's own. There are, however, two points in which it agrees with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: first, that it is directed chiefly to another, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is; secondly, that it is concerned with external things, and so is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, albeit under a different aspect, a stated in this Article and above (2, ad 3). Hence it is that liberality is reckoned by some to be a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, being annexed thereto as to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although liberality does not consider the legal due that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considers, it considers a certain moral due. This due is based on a certain fittingness and not on an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>: so that it answers to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of due in the lowest degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Temperance is about <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in pleasures of the body. But the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and delight in money is not referable to the body but rather to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence liberality does not properly pertain to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The giving of beneficence and mercy proceeds from the fact that a man has a certain affection towards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he gives: wherefore this giving belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> or friendship. But the giving of liberality arises from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being affected in a certain way towards money, in that he desires it not nor loves it: so that when it is fitting he gives it not only to his friends but also to those whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. Hence it belong not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is about external things.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether liberality is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that liberality is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a likeness to the divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is likened chiefly by liberality to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "Who giveth to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> abundantly, and upbraideth not" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse5">James 1:5</a>). Therefore liberality is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. vi, 8), "in things that are great, but not in bulk, to be greatest is to be best." Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> seems to pertain mostly to liberality, since "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is self-communicative," according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> reclines to severity, liberality to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." Therefore liberality is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, men are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and loved on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. ii) that "bounty above all makes a man famous": and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> the liberal are the most beloved." Therefore liberality is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> seems to be more excellent than liberality, although liberality is more pleasing." The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> also says (Rhet. i, 9) that "brave and just men are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> chiefly and, after them, those who are liberal."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> tends towards a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which tends towards the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now liberality tends towards a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in two ways: in one way, primarily and of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; in another way, consequently. Primarily and of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it tends to set in order one's own affection towards the possession and use of money. On this way <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which moderates desires and pleasures relating to one's own body, takes precedence of liberality: and so do <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which, in a manner, are directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of peace, the other in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: while all these are preceded by those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are directed to the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpasses all manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods the public <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; and of the last named the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body surpasses those goods that consist of external things. Again, liberality is ordained to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consequently, and in this way it is directed to all the aforesaid goods. For by reason of his not being a lover of money, it follows that a man readily makes use of it, whether for himself. Or for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, or for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Thus it derives a certain excellence from being useful in many ways. Since, however, we should judge of things according to that which is competent to them primarily and in respect of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, rather than according to that which pertains to them consequently, it remains to be said that liberality is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> giving proceeds from His love for those to whom He gives, not from His affection towards the things He gives, wherefore it seems to pertain to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, rather than to liberality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> shares the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> by giving forth its own act: and the acts of certain other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are better than money which liberality gives forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The friendship whereby a liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is beloved is not that which is based on <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as though he were better than others, but that which is based on utility, because he is more useful in external goods, which as a rule men desire above all others. For the same reason he becomes famous.
