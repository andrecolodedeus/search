<h1>Question 117. The action of man</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1117.htm#article1"> Can one man teach another, as being the cause of his knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1117.htm#article2"> Can man teach an angel?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1117.htm#article3"> Can man change corporeal matter by the power of his soul?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1117.htm#article4"> Can the separate soul of man move bodies by local movement?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether one man can teach another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot teach another. For the Lord says (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse8">Matthew 22:8</a>): "Be not you called Rabbi": on which the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, "Lest you give to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore to be a master is properly an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it belongs to a master to teach. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot teach, and this is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> teaches another this is only inasmuch as he acts through his own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the other. But a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> through which anyone acts so as to produce his like, is an active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is an active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> just as heat is.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we require <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, and the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the thing understood. But a man cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> either of these in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore a man cannot by teaching <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the teacher does nothing in regard to a disciple save to propose to him certain signs, so as to signify something by words or gestures. But it is not possible to teach anyone so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in him, by putting signs before him. For these are signs either of things that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, or of things he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. If of things that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, he to whom these signs are proposed is already in the possession of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and does not acquire it from the master. If they are signs of things that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he can learn nothing therefrom: for instance, if one were to speak Greek to a man who only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, he would learn nothing thereby. Therefore in no way can a man <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in another by teaching him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse7">1 Timothy 2:7</a>): "Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> . . . a <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this question there have been various opinions. For <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, commenting on De Anima iii, maintains that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have one passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in common, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2). From this it follows that the same intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> belong to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Consequently he held that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> another to have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> distinct from that which he has himself; but that he communicates the identical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which he has himself, by moving him to order rightly the phantasms in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that they be rightly disposed for intelligible apprehension. This opinion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> so far as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the same in disciple and master, if we consider the identity of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: for the same objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by both of them. But so far as he maintains that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have but one passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the same intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, differing only as to various phantasms, his opinion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as stated above (Question 76, Article 2).

<p>Besides this, there is the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, who held that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are possessed of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the very beginning, through the participation of separate forms, as stated above (84, 3,4); but that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is hindered, through its union with the body, from the free consideration of those things which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. According to this, the disciple does not acquire fresh <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from his master, but is roused by him to consider what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; so that to learn would be nothing else than to remember. In the same way they held that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agents only dispose (<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>) to receive forms, which <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> acquires by a participation of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But against this we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (79, 2; 84, 3) that the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in pure <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to intelligible (<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>), as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Anima iii, 4).

<p>We must therefore decide the question differently, by saying that the teacher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the learner, by reducing him from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. viii, 4). In order to make this clear, we must observe that of effects proceeding from an exterior principle, some proceed from the exterior principle alone; as the form of a house is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by art alone: whereas other effects proceed sometimes from an exterior principle, sometimes from an interior principle: thus health is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in a sick <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, sometimes by an exterior principle, namely by the medical art, sometimes by an interior principle as when a man is healed by the force of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In these latter effects two things must be noticed.

<p>First, that art in its work imitates <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> for just as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> heals a man by alteration, digestion, rejection of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the sickness, so does art.

<p>Secondly, we must remark that the exterior principle, art, acts, not as principal agent, but as helping the principal agent, but as helping the principal agent, which is the interior principle, by strengthening it, and by furnishing it with instruments and assistance, of which the interior principle makes use in producing the effect. Thus the physician strengthens <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and employs food and medicine, of which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> makes use for the intended end.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, both from an interior principle, as is clear in one who procures <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by his own research; and from an exterior principle, as is clear in one who learns (by instruction). For in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is a certain principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, namely the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, through which certain universal principles of all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> understood as soon as proposed to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now when anyone applies these universal principles to certain particular things, the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> or experience of which he acquires through the senses; then by his own research advancing from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the unknown, he obtains <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not before. Wherefore anyone who teaches, leads the disciple from things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the latter, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things previously unknown to him; according to what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i, 1): "All teaching and all learning proceed from previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p>Now the master leads the disciple from things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unknown, in a twofold manner.

<p>Firstly, by proposing to him certain helps or means of instruction, which his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can use for the acquisition of science: for instance, he may put before him certain less universal propositions, of which nevertheless the disciple is able to judge from previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: or he may propose to him some sensible examples, either by way of likeness or of opposition, or something of the sort, from which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the learner is led to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> previously unknown.

<p>Secondly, by strengthening the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the learner; not, indeed, by some active power as of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as explained above (106, 1; 111, 1) of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> enlightenment, because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> are of one grade in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order; but inasmuch as he proposes to the disciple the order of principles to conclusions, by reason of his not having sufficient collating power to be able to draw the conclusions from the principles. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Poster. i, 2) that "a demonstration is a syllogism that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." In this way a demonstrator <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> his hearer to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, the teacher only brings exterior help as the physician who heals: but just as the interior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the healing, so the interior light of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the principal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But both of these are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore as of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is it written: "Who healeth all thy diseases" (<a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse3">Psalm 102:3</a>); so of Him is it written: "He that teacheth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa093.htm#verse10">Psalm 93:10</a>), inasmuch as "the light of His countenance is signed upon us" (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse7">Psalm 4:7</a>), through which light all things are shown to us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> argues, the teacher does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the disciple after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> need not be an active <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>: but is the principle by which one is directed in teaching, just as art is the principle by which one is directed in working.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The master does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light in the disciple, nor does he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> directly: but he moves the disciple by teaching, so that the latter, by the power of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, forms intelligible concepts, the signs of which are proposed to him from without.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The signs proposed by the master to the disciple are of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in a general and confused manner; but not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in detail and distinctly. Therefore when anyone acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by himself, he cannot be called self-taught, or be said to have his own master because perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> did not precede in him, such as is required in a master.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether man can teach the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that men teach <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse10">Ephesians 3:10</a>): "That the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the union of all the faithful. Therefore some things are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> through men.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are enlightened immediately concerning Divine things by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can instruct the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as stated above (116, 1; 112, 3). But some men are instructed immediately concerning Divine things by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; as appears principally of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>: "Last of all, in these days (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) hath spoken to us by His Son." Therefore some men have been able to teach the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are instructed by the superior. But some men are higher than some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; since some men are taken up to the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> orders, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.). Therefore some of the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be instructed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> concerning Divine things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that every Divine enlightenment to the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by making their thoughts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them; but concerning Divine things superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are never enlightened by inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now it is manifest that in the same way as inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are subject to the superior, the highest men are subject even to the lowest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This is clear from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> words (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>): "There hath not risen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> a greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>; yet he that is lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is greater than he." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are never enlightened by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> concerning Divine things. But men can by means of speech make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the thoughts of their hearts: because it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the heart's secrets.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. v, 19) thus explains this passage of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, who in the preceding verses says: "To me, the least of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is given this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> . . . to enlighten all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may see what is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which hath been hidden from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hidden, yet so that the multiform wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places--that is, through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." As though he were to say: This <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was hidden from men, but not from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which is contained in the principalities and powers who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it "from all ages, but not before all ages: because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was at first there, where after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> this Church composed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will be gathered together."

<p>It can also be explained otherwise that "what is hidden, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also here where when it takes place and is made public," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says further on (Gen. ad lit. v, 19). Thus when the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were fulfilled by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, some things concerning these mysteries became apparent to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which were hidden from them before. In this way we can understand what <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Comment. in Ep. ad Eph.)--that from the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> learned certain mysteries; that is to say, through the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the mysteries were realized in the things themselves: thus by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking in the passage quoted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were instructed immediately by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, not according to His Divinity, but according as He spoke in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain men in this state of life are greater than certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not actually, but virtually; forasmuch as they have such great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that they can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a higher degree of beatitude than that possessed by certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. In the same way we might say that the seed of a great tree is virtually greater than a small tree, though actually it is much smaller.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man by the power of his soul can change corporeal matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the power of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dialog. ii, 30): "Saints work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> sometimes by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, sometimes by their power: thus <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, raised the dead Tabitha to life, and by his reproof delivered to death the lying Ananias and Saphira." But in the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> a change is wrought in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore men, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, can change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on these words (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse1">Galatians 3:1</a>): "Who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?" the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says that "some have blazing eyes, who by a single look bewitch others, especially children." But this would not be unless the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by the power of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is nobler than other inferior bodies. But by the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is changed to heat and cold, as appears when a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> or afraid: indeed this change sometimes goes so far as to bring on sickness and death. Much more, then, can the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its power change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 8): "Corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone at will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 110, Article 2), corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not changed to (the reception of) a form save either by some agent composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, in whom both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> virtually, as in the primordial <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of both. Wherefore of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also we have stated (110, 2) that they cannot change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, except by employing corporeal agents for the production of certain effects. Much less therefore can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, except by means of bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are said to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by the power of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is clear from what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in the same place: "Those who are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in power, as John says--what wonder is there that they should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by that power?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> assigns the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bewitchment to the fact that corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> tendency to obey <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> contrary agents. Therefore when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of strong <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, it can change corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. This he says is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye."

<p>But it has been shown above (Question 110, Article 2) that corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not obey <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> at will, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> alone. Therefore it is better to say, that by a strong <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> the (corporeal) spirits of the body united to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are changed, which change in the spirits takes place especially in the eyes, to which the more subtle spirits can reach. And the eyes infect the air which is in contact with them to a certain distance: in the same way as a new and clear mirror contracts a tarnish from the look of a "menstruata," as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil.; [De Insomniis ii).

<p>Hence then when a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is vehemently moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as occurs mostly in little old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, according to the above explanation, the countenance becomes venomous and hurtful, especially to children, who have a tender and most impressionable body. It is also possible that by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission, or from some hidden <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, the spiteful <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> co-operate in this, as the witches may have some compact with them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which obeys the reason in a certain way, as stated above (Question 81, Article 3), it is the act of a corporeal organ. Therefore at the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> must needs be moved with an accompanying corporeal operation. But the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not suffice to work a change in exterior bodies, except by means of a change in the body united to it, as stated above (ad 2).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the separate human soul can move bodies at least locally?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the separate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can move bodies at least locally. For a body <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> obeys a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> as to local motion, as stated above (Question 110, Article 5). But the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore it can move exterior bodies by its command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the Itinerary of Clement it is said in the narrative of Nicetas to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, that Simon Magus, by sorcery retained power over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a child that he had slain, and that through this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he worked magical wonders. But this could not have been without some corporeal change at least as to place. Therefore, the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has the power to move bodies locally.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima i, 3) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot move any other body whatsoever but its own.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power move a body. For it is manifest that, even while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body, it does not move the body except as endowed with life: so that if one of the members become lifeless, it does not obey the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as to local motion. Now it is also manifest that no body is quickened by the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore within the limits of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power the separate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot command the obedience of a body; though, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it can exceed those limits.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are certain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> whose powers are not determinate to certain bodies; such are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> unfettered by a body; consequently various bodies may obey them as to movement. But if the motive power of a separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> determinate to move a certain body, that <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> will not be able to move a body of higher degree, but only one of lower degree: thus according to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> the mover of the lower <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> cannot move the higher <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> determinate to move the body of which it is the form, it cannot by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power move any other body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei x, 11) and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxviii in Matt.) say, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> often pretend to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, in order to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of heathen <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. It is therefore credible that <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was deceived by some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who pretended to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the child whom the magician had slain.
