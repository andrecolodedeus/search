<h1>Question 118. The production of man from man as to the soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1118.htm#article1"> Is the sensitive soul transmitted with the semen?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1118.htm#article2"> Is the intellectual soul thus transmitted?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1118.htm#article3"> Were all souls created at the same time?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the sensitive soul is transmitted with the semen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not transmitted with the semen, but <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For every perfect <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, that begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, acquires <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> not by generation, but by creation: for nothing is generated save from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a perfect <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, otherwise it could not move the body; and since it is the form of a body, it is not composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Therefore it begins to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> not by generation but by creation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in living things the principle of generation is the generating power; which, since it is one of the powers of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is of a lower order than the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now nothing acts beyond its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the animal's generating power.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the generator begets its like: so that the form of the generator must be actually in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of generation. But neither the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself nor any part thereof is actually in the semen, for no part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is elsewhere than in some part of the body; while in the semen there is not even a particle of the body, because there is not a particle of the body which is not made from the semen and by the power thereof. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not produced through the semen.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if there be in the semen any principle productive of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, this principle either remains after the animal is begotten, or it does not remain. Now it cannot remain. For either it would be identified with the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the begotten animal; which is impossible, for thus there would be identity between begetter and begotten, maker and made: or it would be distinct therefrom; and again this is impossible, for it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 76, Article 4) that in one animal there is but one formal principle, which is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If on the other hand the aforesaid principle does not remain, this again seems to be impossible: for thus an agent would act to its own destruction, which cannot be. Therefore the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be generated from the semen.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The power in the semen is to the animal seminally generated, as the power in the elements of the world is to animals produced from these elements--for instance by putrefaction. But in the latter animals the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is produced by the elemental power, according to <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse20">Genesis 1:20</a>: "Let the waters bring forth the creeping creatures having life." Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of animals seminally generated are produced by the seminal power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of animals are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (65, 4). This opinion would hold if the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were subsistent, having being and operation of itself. For thus, as having being and operation of itself, to be made would needs be proper to it. And since a simple and subsistent thing cannot be made except by creation, it would follow that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would arrive at <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by creation.

<p>But this principle is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>--namely, that being and operation are proper to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as has been made clear above (Question 75, Article 3): for it would not cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> when the body perishes. Since, therefore, it is not a subsistent form, its relation to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is that of the corporeal forms, to which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> does not belong as proper to them, but which are said to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> forasmuch as the subsistent composites <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> through them.

<p>Wherefore to be made is proper to composites. And since the generator is like the generated, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that both the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and all other like forms are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by certain corporeal agents that reduce the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, through some corporeal power of which they are possessed.

<p>Now the more powerful an agent, the greater scope its action has: for instance, the hotter a body, the greater the distance to which its heat carries. Therefore bodies not endowed with life, which are the lowest in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, generate their like, not through some medium, but by themselves; thus fire by itself generates fire. But living bodies, as being more powerful, act so as to generate their like, both without and with a medium. Without a medium--in the work of nutrition, in which flesh generates flesh: with a medium--in the act of generation, because the semen of the animal or plant derives a certain active force from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the generator, just as the instrument derives a certain motive power from the principal agent. And as it matters not whether we say that something is moved by the instrument or by the principal agent, so neither does it matter whether we say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the generated is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the generator, or by some seminal power derived therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a perfect self-subsistent <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. We have said enough (25, 3) on this point, nor need we repeat it here.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The generating power begets not only by its own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but by that of the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of which it is a power. Therefore the generating power of a plant generates a plant, and that of an animal begets an animal. For the more perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, to so much a more perfect effect is its generating power ordained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This active force which is in the semen, and which is derived from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the generator, is, as it were, a certain movement of this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself: nor is it the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or a part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, save virtually; thus the form of a bed is not in the saw or the axe, but a certain movement towards that form. Consequently there is no need for this active force to have an actual organ; but it is based on the (vital) spirit in the semen which is frothy, as is attested by its whiteness. In which spirit, moreover, there is a certain heat derived from the power of the heavenly bodies, by virtue of which the inferior bodies also act towards the production of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as stated above (115, 3, ad 2). And since in this (vital) spirit the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is concurrent with the power of a heavenly body, it has been said that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the sun generate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Moreover, elemental heat is employed instrumentally by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> power, as also by the nutritive power, as stated (De Anima ii, 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In perfect animals, generated by coition, the active force is in the semen of the male, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal. ii, 3); but the foetal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is provided by the female. In this matter, the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> from the very beginning, not as to the second act, but as to the first act, as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in one who sleeps. But as soon as it begins to attract nourishment, then it already operates in act. This <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> therefore is transmuted by the power which is in the semen of the male, until it is actually informed by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; not as though the force itself which was in the semen becomes the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for thus, indeed, the generator and generated would be identical; moreover, this would be more like nourishment and growth than generation, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says. And after the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by the power of the active principle in the semen, has been produced in one of the principal parts of the thing generated, then it is that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the offspring begins to work towards the perfection of its own body, by nourishment and growth. As to the active power which was in the semen, it ceases to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, when the semen is dissolved and the (vital) spirit thereof vanishes. Nor is there anything unreasonable in this, because this force is not the principal but the instrumental agent; and the movement of an instrument ceases when once the effect has been produced.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the intellectual soul is produced from the semen?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is produced from the semen. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen046.htm#verse26">Genesis 46:26</a>): "All the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that came out of [<a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a>] thigh, sixty-six." But nothing is produced from the thigh of a man, except from the semen. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is produced from the semen.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as shown above (Question 76, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, sensitive, and nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are, in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is generated from the semen, as in other animals; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal. ii, 3) that the animal and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are not made at the same time, but first of all the animal is made having a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is produced from the semen.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is one and the same agent whose action is directed to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and to the form: else from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the form there would not result something simply one. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, which is produced by the power of the semen. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is produced by the power of the semen.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begets his like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is constituted by the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is from the begetter.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concurs in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concurs in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, since sometimes offspring is begotten of illicit intercourse. Therefore the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in De Eccl. Dogmat. xiv that "the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not engendered by coition."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for an active power <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to extend its action to the production of an immaterial effect. Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> transcends <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; for it has an operation in which the body takes no part whatever. It is therefore impossible for the seminal power to produce the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle.

<p>Again, the seminal power acts by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the begetter according as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the begetter is the act of the body, making use of the body in its operation. Now the body has nothing whatever to do in the operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> principle, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, cannot reach the semen. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. Animal. ii, 3): "It follows that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone comes from without."

<p>Again, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an operation independent of the body, it is subsistent, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 75, Article 2): therefore to be and to be made are proper to it. Moreover, since it is an immaterial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> it cannot be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> through generation, but only through creation by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore to hold that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the begetter, is nothing else than to hold the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be non-subsistent and consequently to perish with the body. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted with the semen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the passage quoted, the part is put instead of the whole, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the figure of synecdoche.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some say that the vital functions observed in the embryo are not from its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the mother; or from the formative power of the semen. Both of these explanations are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for vital functions such as feeling, nourishment, and growth cannot be from an extrinsic principle. Consequently it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the embryo; the nutritive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the beginning, then the sensitive, lastly the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Therefore some say that in addition to the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> first, another, namely the sensitive, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> supervenes; and in addition to this, again another, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus there would be in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> three <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of which one would be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to another. This has been disproved above (Question 76, Article 3).

<p>Therefore others say that the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was at first merely vegetative, afterwards through the action of the seminal power, becomes a sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and finally this same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> becomes <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, not indeed through the active seminal power, but by the power of a higher agent, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enlightening (the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>) from without. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> comes from without. But this will not hold.

<p>First, because no <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form is susceptible of more or less; but addition of greater perfection constitutes another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, just as the addition of unity constitutes another <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of number. Now it is not possible for the same identical form to belong to different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Secondly, because it would follow that the generation of an animal would be a continuous movement, proceeding gradually from the imperfect to the perfect, as happens in alteration.

<p>Thirdly, because it would follow that the generation of a man or an animal is not generation simply, because the subject thereof would be a being in act. For if the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is from the beginning in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of offspring, and is subsequently gradually brought to perfection; this will imply addition of further perfection without corruption of the preceding perfection. And this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of generation properly so called.

<p>Fourthly, because either that which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is something subsistent: and thus it must needs be <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> distinct from the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> form, which was non-subsistent; and we shall then come back to the opinion of those who held the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of several <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the body--or else it is not subsistent, but a perfection of the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and from this it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perishes with the body, which cannot be admitted.

<p>There is again another explanation, according to those who held that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have but one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in common: but this has been disproved above (Question 76, Article 2).

<p>We must therefore say that since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that both in men and in other animals, when a more perfect form supervenes the previous form is corrupted: yet so that the supervening form contains the perfection of the previous form, and something in addition. It is in this way that through many generations and corruptions we arrive at the ultimate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form, both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals. This indeed is apparent to the senses in animals generated from putrefaction. We conclude therefore that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, and this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is at the same time sensitive and nutritive, the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> forms being corrupted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument holds in the case of diverse agents not ordered to one another. But where there are many agents ordered to one another, nothing hinders the power of the higher agent from reaching to the ultimate form; while the powers of the inferior agents extend only to some disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: thus in the generation of an animal, the seminal power disposes the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Now it is manifest from what has been said above (105, 5; 110, 1) that the whole of corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> acts as the instrument of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power, especially of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore nothing hinders the formation of the body from being due to a corporeal power, while the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Man begets his like, forasmuch as by his seminal power the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is disposed for the reception of a certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of form.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In the action of the adulterer, what is of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; in this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concurs. But what there is of inordinate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; in this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not concur.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether human souls were created together at the beginning of the world?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together at the beginning of the world. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis 2:2</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested Him from all His work which He had done." This would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> every day. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> before all others belong to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. If therefore <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with the bodies, every day innumerable <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> would be added to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: consequently at the beginning the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> would have been imperfect. This is contrary to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis 2:2</a>, where it is said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ended" all "His work."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains, when the body perishes. Therefore it began to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> before the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said (De Eccl. Dogmat. xiv, xviii) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together with the body."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have maintained that it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body, asserting that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as those <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> which are not united to a body. These, therefore, stated that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the beginning. But this statement is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Firstly, in the very principle on which it is based. For if it were <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who results from this union is a being by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>; or that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a man, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above (Question 75, Article 4). Moreover, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the different mode of understanding, as shown above (55, 2; 85, 1): for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understands through receiving from the senses, and turning to phantasms, as stated above (84, 6,7; 85, 1). For this reason the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> needs to be united to the body, which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to it for the operation of the sensitive part: whereas this cannot be said of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p>Secondly, this statement can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in itself. For if it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body, it is unnatural to it to be without a body, and as long as it is without a body it is deprived of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> perfection. Now it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should begin His work with things imperfect and unnatural, for He did not make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without a hand or a foot, which are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> parts of a man. Much less, therefore, did He make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without a body.

<p>But if someone say that it is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to the body, he must give the reason why it is united to a body. And the reason must be either because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so willed, or for some other reason. If because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> willed it--this seems incongruous.

<p>First, because it would be unreasonable of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to wish to be united to the body, if it did not need the body: for if it did need it, it would be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for it to be united to it, since "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>."

<p>Secondly, because there would be no reason why, having been <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> from the beginning of the world, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should, after such a long time, come to wish to be united to the body. For a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is above time, and superior to the heavenly revolutions.

<p>Thirdly, because it would seem that this body was united to this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by chance: since for this union to take place two wills would have to concur--to wit, that of the incoming <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that of the begetter. If, however, this union be neither <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then it must be the result of some <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would have something of a penal and afflicting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This is in keeping with the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who held that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were embodies in punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since, therefore, all these opinions are unreasonable, we must simply confess that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before bodies, but are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> at the same time as they are infused into them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have rested on the seventh day, not from all work, since we read (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a>): "My Father worketh until now"; but from the creation of any new genera and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which may not have already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the first works. For in this sense, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> now, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> already, as to the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in the first works, which included the creation of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Something can be added every day to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as to the number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but not as to the number of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains without the body is due to the corruption of the body, which was a result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently it was not fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without the body from the beginning: for as it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13-16</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death . . . but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with works and words have called it to them."
