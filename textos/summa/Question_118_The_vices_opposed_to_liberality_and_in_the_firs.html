<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether covetousness is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> [avaritia] denotes a certain greed for gold [aeris aviditas*], because, to wit, it consists in a desire for money, under which all external goods may be comprised. [The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> "avaritia" is derived from "aveo" to desire; but the Greek <em>philargyria</em> signifies literally "love of money": and it is to this that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is alluding (cf. 2, Objection 2)]. Now it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to desire external goods: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires them <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, both because they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and because by their means <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is sustained (for which reason they are spoken of as his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is against either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or one's neighbor, or oneself, as stated above (I-II, 72, 4). But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not, properly speaking, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since it is opposed neither to religion nor to the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor again is it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against oneself, for this pertains properly to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>): "He that committeth fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> against his own body." On like manner neither is it apparently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against one's neighbor, since a man harms no one by keeping what is his own. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that occur <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> comes <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to old age and every kind of defect, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse5">Hebrews 13:5</a>): "Let your manners be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, contented with such things as you have."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In whatever things <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in a due measure, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> ensue through excess or deficiency of that measure. Now in all things that are for an end, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in a certain measure: since whatever is directed to an end must needs be commensurate with the end, as, for instance, medicine is commensurate with health, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Polit. i, 6). External goods come under the head of things useful for an end, as stated above (117, 3; I-II, 02, 1). Hence it must needs be that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in their respect consists in a certain measure, in other words, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks, according to a certain measure, to have external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to live in keeping with his <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of life. Wherefore it will be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for him to exceed this measure, by wishing to acquire or keep them immoderately. This is what is meant by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is defined as "immoderate love of possessing." It is therefore evident that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to desire external things as means to an end: wherefore this desire is devoid of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it is held in check by the rule taken from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the end. But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> exceeds this rule, and therefore is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Covetousness may signify immoderation about external things in two ways. First, so as to regard immediately the acquisition and keeping of such things, when, to wit, a man acquires or keeps them more than is due. On this way it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly against one's neighbor, since one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot over-abound in external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, without another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lacking them, for temporal goods cannot be possessed by many at the same time. Secondly, it may signify immoderation in the internal affection which a man has for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> when, for instance, a man loves them, desires them, or delights in them, immoderately. On this way by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself, because it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> disorder in his affections, though not in his body as do the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh.

<p>As a consequence, however, it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> contemns things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> for the sake of temporal things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural inclinations should be regulated according to reason, which is the governing power in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence though old people seek more greedily the aid of external things, just as everyone that is in need seeks to have his need supplied, they are not excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if they exceed this due measure of reason with regard to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether covetousness is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii): "Covetousness, which in Greek is called <em>philargyria</em>, applies not only to silver or money, but also to anything that is desired immoderately." Now in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is immoderate desire of something, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in turning away from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and adhering to mutable goods, as state above (I-II, 71, 6, Objection 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x), "the covetous [avarus] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is so called because he is "greedy for brass [avidus aeris]," i.e. money: wherefore in Greek <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is called <em>philargyria</em>, i.e. "love of silver." Now silver, which stands for money, signifies all external goods the value of which can be measured by money, as stated above (117, 2, ad 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a desire for any external thing: and consequently seems to be a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans 7:7</a>, "For I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>," says: "The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since by forbidding <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, it forbids all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> seems to forbid especially the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus 20:17</a>): "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and so <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Covetousness is numbered together with other special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse29">Romans 1:29</a>), where it is written: "Being filled with all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, fornication, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'avarice'], etc.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their objects, as stated above (I-II, 72, 1). Now the object of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> towards which an inordinate <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends. Hence where there is a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inordinately desired, there is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> differs in aspect from the delightful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, as such, come under the head of useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since they are desired under the aspect of being useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forasmuch as it is an immoderate love of having possessions, which are comprised under the name of money, whence <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> [avaritia] is denominated.

<p>Since, however, the verb "to have," which seems to have been originally employed in connection with possessions whereof we are absolute masters, is applied to many other things (thus a man is said to have health, a wife, clothes, and so forth, as stated in De Praedicamentis), consequently the term "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>" has been amplified to denote all immoderate desire for having anything whatever. Thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (xvi in Ev.) that "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a desire not only for money, but also for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and high places, when prominence is immoderately sought after." On this way <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in the passage quoted in the First Objection. Wherefore this suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All those external things that are subject to the uses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life are comprised under the term "money," inasmuch as they have the aspect of useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But there are certain external goods that can be obtained by money, such as pleasures, honors, and so forth, which are desirable under another aspect. Wherefore the desire for such things is not properly called <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, in so far as it is a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of the inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> for anything whatever. For it is easy to understand that if it is forbidden to covet another's possessions it is also forbidden to covet those things that can be obtained by means of those possessions.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether covetousness is opposed to liberality?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not opposed to liberality. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew 5:6</a>, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," says, (Hom. xv in Matth.) that there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, one general, and the other special, to which <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is opposed: and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says the same (Ethic. v, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not opposed to liberality.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> consists in a man's exceeding the measure in the things he possesses. But this measure is appointed by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and not to liberality.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, liberality is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that observes the mean between two contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 7; iv, 1). But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> has no contrary and opposite <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1,2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not opposed to liberality.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse9">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>): "A covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not be satisfied with money, and he that loveth <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> shall have no fruits from them." Now not to be satisfied with money and to love it inordinately are opposed to liberality, which observes the mean in the desire of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is opposed to liberality.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Covetousness denotes immoderation with regard to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> in two ways. First, immediately in respect of the acquisition and keeping of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. On this way a man obtains money beyond his due, by stealing or retaining another's property. This is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is mentioned (<a href="../bible/eze022.htm#verse27">Ezekiel 22:27</a>): "Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood . . . and to run after gains through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>." Secondly, it denotes immoderation in the interior affections for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; for instance, when a man loves or desires <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> too much, or takes too much pleasure in them, even if he be unwilling to steal. On this way <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is opposed to liberality, which moderates these affections, as stated above (117, 2, ad 3, 3, ad 3, 6). On this sense <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is spoken of (<a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>): "That they would . . . prepare this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> before promised, to be ready, so as a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes: "Lest they should regret what they had given, and give but little."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> are speaking of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in the first sense: <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in the second sense is called illiberality [<em>aneleutheria</em>] by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to appoint the measure in the acquisition and keeping of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> from the point of view of legal due, so that a man should neither take nor retain another's property. But liberality appoints the measure of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, principally in the interior affections, and consequently in the exterior taking and keeping of money, and in the spending of the same, in so far as these proceed from the interior affection, looking at the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from the point of view not of the legal but of the moral debt, which latter depends on the rule of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Covetousness as opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has no opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: since it consists in having more than one ought according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the contrary of which is to have less than one ought, and this is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but a punishment. But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as opposed to liberality has the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of prodigality opposed to it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether covetousness is always a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no one is worthy of death save for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But men are worthy of death on account of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> after saying (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse29">Romans 1:29</a>): "Being filled with all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> . . . fornication, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'avarice']," etc. adds (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans 1:32</a>): "They who do such things are worthy of death." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the least degree of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is to hold to one's own inordinately. But this seemingly is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> says (Serm. super. Luc. xii, 18): "It is the hungry <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> bread that thou keepest back, the naked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> cloak that thou hoardest, the needy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> money that thou possessest, hence thou despoilest as many as thou mightest succor."

<p>Now it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to another, since it is contrary to the love of our neighbor. Much more therefore is all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one is struck with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> blindness save through a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this deprives a man of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xv in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>], "Lust for money brings darkness on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for money, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> build upon this foundation," says (cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Fide et Oper. xvi) that "he builds wood, hay, stubble, who thinks in the things of the world, how he may please the world," which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Now he that builds wood, hay, stubble, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not mortally but venially, for it is said of him that "he shall be saved, yet so as by fire." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is some times a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>) <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is twofold. On one way it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and thus it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of its genus. For in this sense <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> taking or retaining of another's property, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> or robbery, which are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (66, 6,8). Yet venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may occur in this kind of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> by reason of imperfection of the act, as stated above (66, 6, ad 3), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>.

<p>In another way <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> may be take as opposed to liberality: in which sense it denotes inordinate love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Accordingly if the love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> becomes so great as to be preferred to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in such wise that a man, through love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, fear not to act counter to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> will then be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, on the other hand, the inordinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his love stops short of this, so that although he love <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> too much, yet he does not prefer the love of them to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is unwilling for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to do anything in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or his neighbor, then <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Covetousness is numbered together with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by reason of the aspect under which it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil</a> is speaking of a case wherein a man is bound by a legal debt to give of his goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, either through fear of their want or on account of his having too much.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Lust for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, properly speaking, brings darkness on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it puts out the light of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, by preferring the love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether covetousness is the greatest of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach 10:9</a>): "Nothing is more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than a covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," and the text continues: "There is not a more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to sale." Tully also says (De Offic. i, under the heading, '<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> magnanimity is based chiefly on two things'): "Nothing is so narrow or little minded as to love money." But this pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the more grievous it is. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is most opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Q83, qu. 36) that "greed is the bane of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is indicated by its being incurable: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be most grievous, because it is irremissible. But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is an incurable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "old age and helplessness of any kind make men illiberal." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians 5:5</a>) that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is "a serving of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is reckoned among the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Adultery is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse30">Proverbs 6:30</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from the very fact that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, consists in the corruption or privation of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: while, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, it consists in the desire of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Consequently the order of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is despised or corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the graver the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From this point of view a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is most grievous; after this comes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is committed against a man's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and after this comes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against external things, which are deputed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use, and this seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Secondly, the degrees of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be considered on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is inordinately subjected; and then the lesser the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the more deformed is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is more shameful to be subject to a lower than to a higher <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of external things is the lowest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods: since it is less than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, and this is less than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is less than the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. From this point of view the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subjected even to external things, has in a way a greater deformity. Since, however, corruption or privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the formal element in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the material element, the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be judged from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> corrupted, rather than from that of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subjected. Hence we must assert that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not simply the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These authorities speak of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subjected. Hence (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse10">Sirach 10:10</a>) it is given as a reason that the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "setteth his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to sale"; because, to wit, he exposes his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--that is, his life--to danger for the sake of money. Hence the text continues: "Because while he liveth he hath cast away"--that is, despised--"his bowels," in order to make money. Tully also adds that it is the mark of a "narrow mind," namely, that one be willing to be subject to money.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is taking greed generally, in reference to any temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not in its special acceptation for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: because greed for any temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is the bane of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, inasmuch as a man turns away from the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> through cleaving to a temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is incurable in one way, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in another. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is incurable by reason of contempt: for instance, because a man contemns <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, or His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or some one of those things whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are healed: wherefore incurability of this kind points to the greater gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is incurable on the part of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> defect; a thing which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ever seeks to remedy, since the more deficient one is the more one seeks relief from external things, and consequently the more one gives way to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Hence incurability of this kind is an indication not of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being more grievous, but of its being somewhat more dangerous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Covetousness is compared to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> on account of a certain likeness that it bears to it: because the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, like the idolater, subjects himself to an external creature, though not in the same way. For the idolater subjects himself to an external creature by paying it Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, whereas the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subjects himself to an external creature by desiring it immoderately for use, not for worship. Hence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is as grievous a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether covetousness is a spiritual sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> seem to regard <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. But the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is bodily goods, namely, external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is seemingly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh, for it results from the corruption of the flesh, as instanced in old people who, through corruption of carnal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, fall into <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh is one by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body is disordered, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), "He that committeth fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> against his own body." Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> disturbs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even in his body; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxix in Matth.) compares the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was possessed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm">Mark 5</a>) and was troubled in body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> seems not to be a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) numbers <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> among <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sins</a> are seated chiefly in the affections: and all the affections or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have their term in pleasure and sorrow, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 5). Now some pleasures are carnal and some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Carnal pleasures are those which are consummated in the carnal senses--for instance, the pleasures of the table and sexual pleasures: while <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are those which are consummated in the mere apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh are those which are consummated in carnal pleasures, while <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are consummated in pleasures of the spirit without pleasure of the flesh. Such is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: for the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure in the consideration of himself as a possessor of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Covetousness with regard to a bodily object seeks the pleasure, not of the body but only of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, forasmuch as a man takes pleasure in the fact that he possesses <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>: wherefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh. Nevertheless by reason of its object it is a mean between purely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which seek <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure in respect of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> objects (thus <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is about excellence), and purely carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which seek a purely bodily pleasure in respect of a bodily object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Movement takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the term "whereto" and not from the term "wherefrom." Hence a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the flesh is so called from its tending to a pleasure of the flesh, and not from its originating in some defect of the flesh.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> compares a covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was possessed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not that the former is troubled in the flesh in the same way as the latter, but by way of contrast, since while the possessed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of whom we read in <a href="../bible/mar005.htm">Mark 5</a>, stripped himself, the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loads himself with an excess of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether covetousness is a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is opposed to liberality as the mean, and to prodigality as extreme. But neither is liberality a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor prodigality a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> also should not be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as stated above (I-II, 84, 3,4), those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are called capital which have principal ends, to which the ends of other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are directed. But this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: since <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> have the aspect, not of an end, but rather of something directed to an end, as stated in Ethic. i, 5. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xv), that "<a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> arises sometimes from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, sometimes from fear. For there are those who, when they think that they lack the needful for their expenses, allow the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to give way to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. And there are others who, wishing to be thought more of, are incited to greed for other people's property." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> arises from other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> instead of being a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in respect of other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) reckons <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the Second Objection, a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one which under the aspect of end gives rise to other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>: because when an end is very desirable, the result is that through desire thereof <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sets about doing many things either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the most desirable end is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or felicity, which is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, as stated above (I-II, 01, 4,7,8): wherefore the more a thing is furnished with the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the more desirable it is. Also one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is that it be self-sufficing, else it would not set <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> at rest, as the last end does. Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> give great promise of self-sufficiency, as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. iii): the reason of which, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 5), is that we "use money in token of taking possession of something," and again it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>): "All things obey money." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is desire for money, is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue is perfected in accordance with reason, but <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is perfected in accordance with the inclination of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now reason and sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> do not belong chiefly to the same genus, and consequently it does not follow that principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore, although liberality is not a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it does not regard the principal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the reason, yet <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is a principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, because it regards money, which occupies a principal place among sensible goods, for the reason given in the Article.

<p>On the other hand, prodigality is not directed to an end that is desirable principally, indeed it seems rather to result from a lack of reason. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "a prodigal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a fool rather than a knave."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that money is directed to something else as its end: yet in so far as it is useful for obtaining all sensible things, it contains, in a way, all things virtually. Hence it has a certain likeness to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated in the Article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> from arising sometimes out of other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as stated above (36, 4, ad 1; I-II, 84, 4), provided that itself be frequently the source of others.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether treachery, fraud, falsehood, perjury, restlessness, violence, and insensibility to mercy are daughters of covetousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the daughters of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> are not as commonly stated, namely, "treachery, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, falsehood, perjury, restlessness, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and insensibility to mercy." For <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is opposed to liberality, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now treachery, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, and falsehood are opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, perjury to religion, restlessness to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which rests in the beloved object, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, insensibility to mercy. Therefore these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> have no connection with <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, treachery, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and falsehood seem to pertain to the same thing, namely, the deceiving of one's neighbor. Therefore they should not be reckoned as different daughters of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Comment. in Deut.) enumerates nine daughters of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; which are "lying, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, perjury, greed of filthy lucre, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnessing, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, inhumanity, rapacity." Therefore the former reckoning of daughters is insufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 1) mentions many kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> as belonging to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> which he calls illiberality, for he speaks of those who are "sparing, tight-fisted, skinflints [<em>kyminopristes</em>], misers [<em>kimbikes</em>], who do illiberal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," and of those who "batten on whoredom, usurers, gamblers, despoilers of the dead, and robbers." Therefore it seems that the aforesaid enumeration is insufficient.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, tyrants use much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against their subjects. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "tyrants who destroy cities and despoil sacred places are not to be called illiberal," i.e. covetous. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> should not be reckoned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) assigns to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> the daughters mentioned above.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The daughters of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which arise therefrom, especially in respect of the desire of an end. Now since <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is excessive love of possessing <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, it exceeds in two things. For in the first place it exceeds in retaining, and in this respect <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> gives rise to "insensibility to mercy," because, to wit, a man's heart is not softened by mercy to assist the needy with his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> [See 30, 1]. On the second place it belongs to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> to exceed in receiving, and in this respect <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> may be considered in two ways. First as in the thought [affectu]. On this way it gives rise to "restlessness," by hindering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with excessive anxiety and care, for "a covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not be satisfied with money" (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse9">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>). Secondly, it may be considered in the execution [effectu]. On this way the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in acquiring other people's goods, sometimes employs force, which pertains to "<a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>," sometimes deceit, and then if he has recourse to words, it is "falsehood," if it be mere words, "perjury" if he confirm his statement by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; if he has recourse to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and the deceit affects things, we have "<a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>"; if <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, then we have "treachery," as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, who betrayed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no need for the daughters of a capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to belong to that same kind of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one kind allows of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even of a different kind being directed to its end; seeing that it is one thing for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to have daughters, and another for it to have <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These three are distinguished as stated in the Article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These nine are reducible to the seven aforesaid. For lying and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnessing are comprised under <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnessing is a special kind of lie, just as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, wherefore it is comprised under <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>; and greed of filthy lucre belongs to restlessness; rapacity is comprised under <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, since it is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> thereof; and inhumanity is the same as insensibility to mercy.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> rather than daughters of illiberality or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For a man may be said to be illiberal or covetous through a defect in giving. If he gives but little he is said to be "sparing"; if nothing, he is "tightfisted": if he gives with great reluctance, he is said to be <em>kyminopristes</em> [skinflint], a cumin-seller, as it were, because he makes a great fuss about things of little value. Sometimes a man is said to be illiberal or covetous, through an excess in receiving, and this in two ways. On one way, through making money by disgraceful means, whether in performing shameful and servile works by means of illiberal practices, or by acquiring more through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, such as whoredom or the like, or by making a profit where one ought to have given gratis, as in the case of usury, or by laboring much to make little profit. On another way, in making money by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> means, whether by using <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> on the living, as robbers do, or by despoiling the dead, or by preying on one's friends, as gamblers do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Just as liberality is about moderate sums of money, so is illiberality. Wherefore tyrants who take great things by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, are said to be, not illiberal, but <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.
