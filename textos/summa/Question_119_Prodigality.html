<h1>Question 119. Prodigality</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3119.htm#article1"> Is prodigality opposite to covetousness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3119.htm#article2"> Is prodigality a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3119.htm#article3"> Is it a graver sin that covetousness?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prodigality is opposite to covetousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that prodigality is not opposite to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For opposites cannot be together in the same subject. But some are at the same time prodigal and covetous. Therefore prodigality is not opposite to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, opposites relate to one same thing. But <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as opposed to liberality, relates to certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is affected towards money: whereas prodigality does not seem to relate to any <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since it is not affected towards money, or to anything else of the kind. Therefore prodigality is not opposite to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> chiefly from its end, as stated above (I-II, 62, 3). Now prodigality seems always to be directed to some unlawful end, for the sake of which the prodigal squanders his goods. Especially is it directed to pleasures, wherefore it is stated (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse13">Luke 15:13</a>) of the prodigal son that he "wasted his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> living riotously." Therefore it seems that prodigality is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and insensibility rather than to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and liberality.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 1) that prodigality is opposed to liberality, and illiberality, to which we give here the name of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In morals <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to one another and to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in respect of excess and deficiency. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and prodigality differ variously in respect of excess and deficiency. Thus, as regards affection for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exceeds by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> them more than he ought, while the prodigal is deficient, by being less careful of them than he ought: and as regards external action, prodigality implies excess in giving, but deficiency in retaining and acquiring, while <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, on the contrary, denotes deficiency in giving, but excess in acquiring and retaining. Hence it is evident that prodigality is opposed to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing prevents opposites from being in the same subject in different respects. For a thing is denominated more from what is in it principally. Now just as in liberality, which observes the mean, the principal thing is giving, to which receiving and retaining are subordinate, so, too, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and prodigality regard principally giving. Wherefore he who exceeds in giving is said to be "prodigal," while he who is deficient in giving is said to be "covetous." Now it happens sometimes that a man is deficient in giving, without exceeding in receiving, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iv, 1). And in like manner it happens sometimes that a man exceeds in giving, and therefore is prodigal, and yet at the same time exceeds in receiving. This may be due either to some kind of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since while exceeding in giving he is lacking in goods of his own, so that he is driven to acquire unduly, and this pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; or it may be due to inordinateness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for he gives not for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose, but, as though despising <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cares not whence or how he receives. Wherefore he is prodigal and covetous in different respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Prodigality regards <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in respect of money, not as exceeding, but as deficient in them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The prodigal does not always exceed in giving for the sake of pleasures which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, but sometimes through being so disposed as not to care about <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and sometimes on account of something else. More frequently, however, he inclines to intemperance, both because through spending too much on other things he becomes fearless of spending on objects of pleasure, to which the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh is more prone; and because through taking no pleasure in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> goods, he seeks for himself pleasures of the body. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) "that many a prodigal ends in becoming intemperate."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prodigality is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that prodigality is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>): "Covetousness [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'desire of money'] is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." But it is not the root of prodigality, since this is opposed to it. Therefore prodigality is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>): "Charge the rich of this world . . . to give easily, to communicate to others." Now this is especially what prodigal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do. Therefore prodigality is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to prodigality to exceed in giving and to be deficient in solicitude about <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. But this is most becoming to the perfect, who fulfil the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew 6:34</a>), "Be not . . . solicitous for tomorrow," and (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a>), "Sell all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the poor." Therefore prodigality is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The prodigal son is held to blame for his prodigality.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the opposition between prodigality and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is one of excess and deficiency; either of which destroys the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a thing is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> through corrupting the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it follows that prodigality is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some expound this saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> as referring, not to actual <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but to a kind of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the "fomes" [Cf. I-II, 81, 3, ad 2], whence all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> arise. Others say that he is speaking of a general <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> with regard to any kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and in this sense also it is evident that prodigality arises from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; since the prodigal seeks to acquire some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> inordinately, namely, to give pleasure to others, or at least to satisfy his own will in giving. But to one that reviews the passage correctly, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking literally of the desire of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, for he had said previously (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 6:9</a>): "They that will become rich," etc. On this sense <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is said to be "the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>," not that all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> always arise from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but because there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that does not at some time arise from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Wherefore prodigality sometimes is born of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as when a man is prodigal in going to great expense in order to curry favor with certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from whom he may receive <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> bids the rich to be ready to give and communicate their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, according as they ought. The prodigal does not do this: since, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. iv, 1), "his giving is neither <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, nor for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> end, nor according as it ought to be. For sometimes they give much to those who ought to be poor, namely, to buffoons and flatterers, whereas to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they give nothing."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The excess in prodigality consists chiefly, not in the total amount given, but in the amount over and above what ought to be given. Hence sometimes the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gives more than the prodigal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Accordingly we must reply that those who give all their possessions with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and banish from their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> all solicitude for temporal things, are not prodigal but perfectly liberal.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that prodigality is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> a man injures his neighbor by not communicating his goods to him, whereas by prodigality a man injures himself, because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the wasting of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, which are the means whereby a man lives, is an undoing of his very being." Now he that injures himself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously, according to <a href="../bible/sir014.htm#verse5">Sirach 14:5</a>, "He that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to himself, to whom will he be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>?" Therefore prodigality is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a disorder that is accompanied by a laudable circumstance is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now the disorder of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is sometimes accompanied by a laudable circumstance, as in the case of those who are unwilling to spend their own, lest they be driven to accept from others: whereas the disorder of prodigality is accompanied by a circumstance that calls for blame, inasmuch as we ascribe prodigality to those who are intemperate, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iv, 1). Therefore prodigality is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is chief among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (56, 1, ad 1; I-II, 61, 2, ad 1). Now prodigality is more opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is: for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse20">Proverbs 21:20</a>): "There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the just; and the foolish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall spend it": and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 6) that "it is the mark of a fool to give too much and receive nothing." Therefore prodigality is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 6) that "the prodigal seems to be much better than the illiberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Prodigality considered in itself is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and this for three reasons. First, because <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> differs more from the opposite <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since giving, wherein the prodigal exceeds, belongs to liberality more than receiving or retaining, wherein the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exceeds. Secondly, because the prodigal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of use to the many to whom he gives, while the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of use to no one, not even to himself, as stated in Ethic. iv, 6. Thirdly, because prodigality is easily cured. For not only is the prodigal on the way to old age, which is opposed to prodigality, but he is easily reduced to a state of want, since much useless spending impoverishes him and makes him unable to exceed in giving. Moreover, prodigality is easily turned into <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on account of its likeness thereto. On the other hand, the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not easily cured, for the reason given above (118, 5, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The difference between the prodigal and the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not that the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself and the latter against another. For the prodigal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself by spending that which is his, and his means of support, and against others by spending the wherewithal to help others. This applies chiefly to the clergy, who are the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> goods, that belong to the poor whom they defraud by their prodigal expenditure. On like manner the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against others, by being deficient in giving; and he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself, through deficiency in spending: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc006.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> . . . yet doth not give him the power to eat thereof." Nevertheless the prodigal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exceeds in this, that he injures both himself and others yet so as to profit some; whereas the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> profits neither others nor himself, since he does not even use his own goods for his own profit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In speaking of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in general, we judge of them according to their respective <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>: thus, with regard to prodigality we note that it consumes <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to excess, and with regard to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> that it retains them to excess. That one spend too much for the sake of intemperance points already to several additional <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherefore the prodigal of this kind is worse, as stated in Ethic. iv, 1. That an illiberal or covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> refrain from taking what belongs to others, although this appears in itself to call for praise, yet on account of the motive for which he does so it calls for blame, since he is unwilling to accept from others lest he be forced to give to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, even as all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: wherefore if a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> be opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone, for this very reason it is deemed less grievous.
