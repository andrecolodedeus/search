<h1>Question 119. The propagation of man as to the body</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1119.htm#article1"> Is any part of the food changed into true human nature?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1119.htm#article2"> Is the semen, which is the principle of human generation, produced from the surplus food?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether some part of the food is changed into true human nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that none of the food is changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:17</a>): "Whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy." But what is cast out is not changed into the reality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore none of the food is changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. i, 5) distinguishes flesh belonging to the "<a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>" from flesh belonging to "<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>"; and says that the latter "comes and goes." Now what is formed from food comes and goes. Therefore what is produced from food is flesh belonging to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But what belongs to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the food is not changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the "radical humor" seems to belong to the reality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and if it be lost, it cannot be recovered, according to physicians. But it could be recovered if the food were changed into the humor. Therefore food is not changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the food were changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whatever is lost in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could be restored. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> death is due only to the loss of something. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be able by taking food to insure himself against death in perpetuity.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if the food is changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there is nothing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which may not recede or be repaired: for what is generated in a man from his food can both recede and be repaired. If therefore a man lived long enough, it would follow that in the end nothing would be left in him of what belonged to him at the beginning. Consequently he would not be numerically the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> throughout his life; since for the thing to be numerically the same, identity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But this is incongruous. Therefore the food is not changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xi): "The bodily food when corrupted, that is, having lost its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, is changed into the texture of the members." But the texture of the members belongs to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the food is changed into the reality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Metaph. ii), "The relation of a thing to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the same as its relation to being." Therefore that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of any thing which enters into the constitution of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be considered in two ways: firstly, in general according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; secondly, as in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And whereas the form and the common <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belong to a thing's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> considered in general; <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> signate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the form individualized by that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> considered in this particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Thus a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body belong to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general, but to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Peter and Martin belong this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and this body.

<p>Now there are certain things whose form cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> but in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: thus the form of the sun cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> save in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which it actually is. And in this sense some have said that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> but in a certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which, they said, was given that form at the very beginning in the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. So that whatever may have been added to that which was derived by posterity from the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as not receiving in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>But, said they, that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which, in the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was the subject of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, was multiplied in itself: and in this way the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies is derived from the body of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. According to these, the food is not changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; we take food, they stated, in order to help <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to resist the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, and prevent the consumption of the "radical humor"; just as lead or tin is mixed with silver to prevent its being consumed by fire.

<p>But this is unreasonable in many ways.

<p>Firstly, because it comes to the same that a form can be produced in another <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or that it can cease to be in its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; wherefore all things that can be generated are corruptible, and conversely. Now it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form can cease to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in this (particular) <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> which is its subject: else the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body would not be corruptible. Consequently it can begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in another <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so that something else be changed into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Secondly, because in all beings whose entire <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is contained in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> there is only one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: as is clearly the case with the sun, moon and such like. Thus there would only be one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p>Thirdly, because multiplication of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot be understood otherwise than either in respect of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> only, as in things which are rarefied, so that their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> increases in dimensions; or in respect of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But as long as the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> alone of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> remains, it cannot be said to be multiplied; for multitude cannot consist in the addition of a thing to itself, since of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> it can only result from division. Therefore some other <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> must be added to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, either by creation, or by something else being changed into it. Consequently no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> can be multiplied save either by rarefaction as when air is made from water; or by the change of some other things, as fire is multiplied by the addition of wood; or lastly by creation. Now it is manifest that the multiplication of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body does not occur by rarefaction: for thus the body of a man of perfect age would be more imperfect than the body of a child. Nor does it occur by creation of flesh <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: for, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxii): "All things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> together as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but not as to the specific form." Consequently the multiplication of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body can only be the result of the food being changed into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Fourthly, because, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not differ from animals and plants in regard to the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it would follow that the bodies of animals and plants do not increase through a change of nourishment into the body so nourished, but through some kind of multiplication. Which multiplication cannot be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> extend beyond a certain fixed <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; nor again does anything increase <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, save either by rarefaction or the change of something else into it. Consequently the whole process of generation and nourishment, which are called "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> forces," would be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Which is altogether inadmissible.

<p>Wherefore others have said that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form can indeed begin to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in some other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general: but not if we consider it as in this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. For in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> the form remains confined to a certain determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, on which it is first imprinted at the generation of that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, so that it never leaves that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> until the ultimate dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. And this matter, say they, principally belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But since this matter does not suffice for the requisite <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, some other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> must be added, through the change of food into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> partaking thereof, in such a <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> as suffices for the increase required. And this matter, they state, belongs secondarily to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: because it is not required for the primary <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, but for the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> due to him. And if anything further is produced from the food, this does not belong to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, properly speaking. However, this also is inadmissible.

<p>First, because this opinion judges of living bodies as of inanimate bodies; in which, although there be a power of generating their like in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, there is not the power of generating their like in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; which power in living bodies is the nutritive power. Nothing, therefore, would be added to living bodies by their nutritive power, if their food were not changed into their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Secondly, because the active seminal power is a certain impression derived from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the begetter, as stated above (Question 118, Article 1). Hence it cannot have a greater power in acting, than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from which it is derived. If, therefore, by the seminal power a certain <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> assumes the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, much more can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by the nutritive power, imprint the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> on the food which is assimilated.

<p>Thirdly, because food is needed not only for growth, else at the term of growth, food would be needful no longer; but also to renew that which is lost by the action of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat. But there would be no renewal, unless what is formed from the food, took the place of what is lost. Wherefore just as that which was there previously belonged to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so also does that which is formed from the food.

<p>Therefore, according to others, it must be said that the food is really changed into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by reason of its assuming the specific form of flesh, bones and such like parts. This is what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 4): "Food nourishes inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> flesh."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> does not say that the "whole" of what enters into the mouth, but "all"--because something from every kind of food is cast out into the privy. It may also be said that whatever is generated from food, can be dissolved by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, and be cast aside through the pores, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds the passage.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By flesh belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, some have understood that which first receives the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is derived from the begetter: this, they say, lasts as long as the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> does. By flesh belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> these understand what is generated from food: and this, they say, does not always remain, but as it comes so it goes. But this is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. For he says there, that "just as in things which have their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>"--for instance, wood or stone--"so in flesh, there is something belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and something belonging to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>." Now it is clear that this distinction has no place in inanimate things, which are not generated seminally, or nourished. Again, since what is generated from food is united to, by mixing with, the body so nourished, just as water is mixed with wine, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says there by way of example: that which is added, and that to which it is added, cannot be different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, since they are already made one by being mixed together. Therefore there is no reason for saying that one is destroyed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, while the other remains.

<p>It must therefore be said that this distinction of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is not of different kinds of flesh, but of the same flesh considered from different points of view. For if we consider the flesh according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, that is, according to that which is formed therein, thus it remains always: because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh always remains together with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition. But if we consider flesh according to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, then it does not remain, but is gradually destroyed and renewed: thus in the fire of a furnace, the form of fire remains, but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is gradually consumed, and other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is substituted in its place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "radical humor" is said to comprise whatever the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is founded on. If this be taken away it cannot be renewed; as when a man's hand or foot is amputated. But the "nutritive humor" is that which has not yet received perfectly the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is on the way thereto; such is the blood, and the like. Wherefore if such be taken away, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> remains in its root, which is not destroyed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a passible body is weakened by continuous action, because such agents are also patient. Therefore the transforming <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is strong at first so as to be able to transform not only enough for the renewal of what is lost, but also for growth. Later on it can only transform enough for the renewal of what is lost, and then growth ceases. At last it cannot even do this; and then begins decline. In fine, when this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> fails altogether, the animal dies. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of wine that transforms the water added to it, is weakened by further additions of water, so as to become at length watery, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says by way of example (De Gener. i, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Gener. i, 5), when a certain <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is directly transformed into fire, then fire is said to be generated anew: but when <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is transformed into a fire already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, then fire is said to be fed. Wherefore if the entire <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> together loses the form of fire, and another <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> transformed into fire, there will be another distinct fire. But if, while one piece of wood is burning, other wood is laid on, and so on until the first piece is entirely consumed, the same identical fire will remain all the time: because that which is added passes into what pre-existed. It is the same with living bodies, in which by means of nourishment that is renewed which was consumed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the semen is produced from surplus food?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the semen is not produced from the surplus food, but from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the begetter. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 8) that "generation is a work of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, producing, from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the begetter, that which is begotten." But that which is generated is produced from the semen. Therefore the semen is produced from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the begetter.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the son is like his father, in respect of that which he receives from him. But if the semen from which something is generated, is produced from the surplus food, a man would receive nothing from his grandfather and his ancestors in whom the food never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Therefore a man would not be more like to his grandfather or ancestors, than to any other men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the food of the generator is sometimes the flesh of cows, pigs and suchlike. If therefore, the semen were produced from surplus food, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begotten of such semen would be more akin to the cow and the pig, than to his father or other relations.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x, 20) that we were in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> "not only by seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but also in the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the body." But this would not be, if the semen were produced from surplus food. Therefore the semen is not produced therefrom.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves in many ways (De Gener. Animal. i, 18) that "the semen is surplus food."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This question depends in some way on what has been stated above (1; 118, 1). For if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for the communication of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to alien <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not only in another, but also in its own subject; it is clear that the food which at first is dissimilar, becomes at length similar through the form communicated to it. Now it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order that a thing should be reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act gradually: hence in things generated we observe that at first each is imperfect and is afterwards perfected. But it is clear that the common is to the proper and determinate, as imperfect is to perfect: therefore we see that in the generation of an animal, the animal is generated first, then the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or the horse. So therefore food first of all receives a certain common <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in regard to all the parts of the body, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is subsequently determinate to this or that part.

<p>Now it is not possible that the semen be a kind of solution from what is already transformed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the members. For this solution, if it does not retain the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the member it is taken from, it would no longer be of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the begetter, and would be due to a process of corruption; and consequently it would not have the power of transforming something else into the likeness of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But if it retained the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the member it is taken from, then, since it is limited to a certain part of the body, it would not have the power of moving towards (the production of) the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that part. Unless one were to say that the solution is taken from all the parts of the body, and that it retains the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each part. Thus the semen would be a small animal in act; and generation of animal from animal would be a mere division, as mud is generated from mud, and as animals which continue to live after being cut in two: which is inadmissible.

<p>It remains to be said, therefore, that the semen is not something separated from what was before the actual whole; rather is it the whole, though <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, having the power, derived from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the begetter, to produce the whole body, as stated above (1; 108, 1). Now that which is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the whole, is that which is generated from the food, before it is transformed into the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the members. Therefore the semen is taken from this. In this sense the nutritive power is said to serve the generative power: because what is transformed by the nutritive power is employed as semen by the generative power. A sign of this, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, is that animals of great size, which require much food, have little semen in proportion to the size of their bodies, and generated seldom; in like manner fat men, and for the same reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Generation is from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the begetter in animals and plants, inasmuch as the semen owes its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the form of the begetter, and inasmuch as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness of the begetter to the begotten is on account not of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but of the form of the agent that generates its like. Wherefore in order for a man to be like his grandfather, there is no need that the corporeal seminal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should have been in the grandfather; but that there be in the semen a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derived from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the grandfather through the father. In like manner the third objection is answered. For kinship is not in relation to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but rather to the derivation of the forms.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> are not to be understood as though the immediate seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or the corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> from which this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> was formed were actually in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: but so that both were in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as in principle. For even the corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is supplied by the mother, and which he calls the corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, is originally derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: and likewise the active seminal power of the father, which is the immediate seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (in the production) of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to have been in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> according to the "corporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," not according to the seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> from which His Body was formed, and which was supplied by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mother</a>, was derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>; whereas the active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was not derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, because His Body was not formed by the seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a man, but by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For "such a birth was becoming to Him," [<a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">Hymn</a> for Vespers at Christmas; <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, O. P.], WHO IS ABOVE ALL GOD FOR EVER BLESSED. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.
