<h1>Question 11. Heresy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3011.htm#article1"> Is heresy a kind of unbelief?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3011.htm#article2"> The matter about which it is</a> <li><a href="../summa/3011.htm#article3"> Should heretics be tolerated?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3011.htm#article4"> Should converts be received?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether heresy is a species of unbelief?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief. For unbelief is in the understanding, as stated above (Question 10, Article 2). Now <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> would seem not to pertain to the understanding, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power; for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a>: [Cf. Decretals xxiv, qu. iii, cap. 27 "The works of the flesh are manifest: Heresy is derived from a Greek word meaning choice, whereby a man makes choice of that school which he deems best." But choice is an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as stated above (I-II, 13, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> chiefly from its end; hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he who commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> that he may steal, is a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> rather than an adulterer." Now the end of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is temporal profit, especially lordship and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Util. Credendi i) that "a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is one who either devises or follows <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and new opinions, for the sake of some temporal profit, especially that he may lord and be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> above others." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> rather than of unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since unbelief is in the understanding, it would seem not to pertain to the flesh. Now <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> belongs to the works of the flesh, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a>): "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>," and among the others, he adds, "dissensions, sects," which are the same as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Falsehood is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is one who devises or follows <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> or new opinions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is founded; and consequently it is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as stated in the first objection denotes a choosing. Now choice as stated above (I-II, 13, 3) is about things directed to the end, the end being presupposed. Now, in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> assents to some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as to its proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as was shown above (Question 4, Article 3): wherefore that which is the chief <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has the character of last end, while those which are secondary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, have the character of being directed to the end.

<p>Now, whoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, assents to someone's words; so that, in every form of unbelief, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whose words assent is given seems to hold the chief place and to be the end as it were; while the things by holding which one assents to that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> hold a secondary place. Consequently he that holds the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> aright, assents, by his will, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in those things which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belong to His doctrine.

<p>Accordingly there are two ways in which a man may deviate from the rectitude of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. First, because he is unwilling to assent to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and such a man has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, so to say, in respect of the very end. This belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Secondly, because, though he intends to assent to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet he fails in his choice of those things wherein he assents to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because he chooses not what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> really taught, but the suggestions of his own mind.

<p>Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, belonging to those who profess the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but corrupt its dogmas.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Choice regards unbelief in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> regards <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Vices take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their proximate end, while, from their remote end, they take their genus and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Thus in the case of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> committed for the sake of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, there is the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> taken from its proper end and object; but the ultimate end shows that the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is both the result of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, and is included under it, as an effect under its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> under its genus, as appears from what we have said about acts in general (I-II, 18, 7). Wherefore, as to the case in point also, the proximate end of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is adherence to one's own <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion, and from this it derives its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, while its remote end reveals its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, viz. that it arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is so called from its being a choosing [From the Greek <em>airein</em> [hairein], to cut off], so does sect derive its name from its being a cutting off [secando], as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states (Etym. viii, 3). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and sect are the same thing, and each belongs to the works of the flesh, not indeed by reason of the act itself of unbelief in respect of its proximate object, but by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is either the desire of an undue end in which way it arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as stated in the second objection, or some illusion of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> (which gives rise to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states in Metaph. iv; Ed. Did. iii, 5), for this faculty has a certain connection with the flesh, in as much as its act is independent on a bodily organ.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether heresy is properly about matters of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not properly about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For just as there are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and sects among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so were there among the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> observes (Etym. viii, 3,4,5). Now their dissensions were not about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as though they were its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not only about things, but also about works, and about interpretations of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians 5:20</a> that "whoever expounds the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in any sense but that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by Whom they were written, may be called a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, though he may not have left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>": and elsewhere he says that "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> spring up from words spoken amiss." [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> quotes this saying elsewhere, in Sent. iv, D, 13, and III, 16, 8, but it is not to be found in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works.] Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not properly about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we find the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> differing even about matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for example <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, on the question about the cessation of the legal observances: and yet this was without any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on their part. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not properly about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a> [Cf. De Civ. Dei xviii, 1]: "In Christ's Church, those are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who hold mischievous and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinions, and when rebuked that they may think soundly and rightly, offer a stubborn resistance, and, refusing to mend their pernicious and deadly doctrines, persist in defending them." Now pernicious and deadly doctrines are none but those which are contrary to the dogmas of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby "the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans 1:17</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as about its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We are speaking of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> now as denoting a corruption of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now it does not imply a corruption of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if a man has a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion in matters that are not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for instance, in questions of geometry and so forth, which cannot belong to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by any means; but only when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion about things belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Now a thing may be of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in two ways, as stated above (I, 32, 4; I-II, 1, 6, ad 1; I-II, 2, 5), in one way, directly and principally, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>; in another way, indirectly and secondarily, e.g. those matters, the denial of which leads to the corruption of some <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">article of faith</a>; and there may be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in either way, even as there can be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and Pharisees were about opinions relating to Judaism or Pharisaism, so also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are about <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> touching the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to expound <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> in another sense than that required by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when he so distorts the meaning of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, that it is contrary to what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has revealed. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/eze013.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 13:6</a>) about the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: "They have persisted to confirm what they have said," viz. by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretations of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. Moreover a man professes his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the words that he utters, since confession is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 1). Wherefore inordinate words about matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may lead to corruption of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and hence it is that Pope Leo says in a letter to Proterius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alexandria: "The enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross lie in wait for our every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and word, so that, if we but give them the slightest pretext, they may accuse us mendaciously of agreeing with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. xliii) and we find it stated in the Decretals (xxiv, qu. 3, can. Dixit Apostolus): "By no means should we accuse of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> those who, however <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and perverse their opinion may be, defend it without obstinate fervor, and seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with careful anxiety, ready to mend their opinion, when they have found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," because, to wit, they do not make a choice in contradiction to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Accordingly, certain <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> seem to have differed either in matters the holding of which in this or that way is of no consequence, so far as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is concerned, or even in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which were not as yet defined by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; although if anyone were obstinately to deny them after they had been defined by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he would be deemed a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. This authority resides chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>. For we read [Decret. xxiv, qu. 1, can. Quoties]: "Whenever a question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in dispute, I think, that all our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ought to refer the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to none other than <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, as being the source of their name and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, against whose authority neither <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> nor <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> nor any of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> defended their opinion." Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Exposit. Symbol [Among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>]): "This, most blessed Pope, is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that we have been taught in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church. If anything therein has been incorrectly or carelessly expressed, we beg that it may be set aright by you who hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and see of Peter. If however this, our profession, be approved by the judgment of your apostleship, whoever may blame me, will <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that he himself is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or malicious, or even not a catholic but a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether heretics ought to be tolerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought to be tolerated. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2 Timothy 2:24-25</a>): "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle . . . with modesty admonishing them that resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if peradventure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may give them repentance to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and they may recover themselves from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>." Now if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not tolerated but put to death, they lose the opportunity of repentance. Therefore it seems contrary to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be tolerated. Now <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>): "There must be . . . <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they . . . who are reproved, may be manifest among you." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be tolerated.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> commanded his servants (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew 13:30</a>) to suffer the cockle "to grow until the harvest," i.e. the end of the world, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains it. Now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men explain that the cockle denotes <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be tolerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus 3:10-11</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after the first and second admonition, avoid: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he, that is such an one, is subverted."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> With regard to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On their own side there is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which quickens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, much more reason is there for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as soon as they are convicted of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to be not only <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> but even put to death.

<p>On the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, there is mercy which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but "after the first and second admonition," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse9">Galatians 5:9</a>, "A little leaven," says: "Cut off the decayed flesh, expel the mangy sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, the whole paste, the whole body, the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> was but one spark in Alexandria, but as that spark was not at once put out, the whole earth was laid waste by its flame."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This very modesty demands that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should be admonished a first and second time: and if he be unwilling to retract, he must be reckoned as already "subverted," as we may gather from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> quoted above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The profit that ensues from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is beside the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, for it consists in the constancy of the faithful being put to the test, and "makes us shake off our sluggishness, and search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> more carefully," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Gen. cont. Manich. i, 1). What they really intend is the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is to inflict very great harm indeed. Consequently we should consider what they directly intend, and expel them, rather than what is beside their <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and so, tolerate them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to Decret. (xxiv, qu. iii, can. Notandum), "to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> is not to be uprooted." A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>) that his "spirit may be saved in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>." Yet if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> be altogether uprooted by death, this is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> command, which is to be understood as referring to the case when the cockle cannot be plucked up without plucking up the wheat, as we explained above (10, 8, ad 1), when treating of unbelievers in general.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the Church should receive those who return from heresy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought in all cases to receive those who return from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 3:1</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Lord: "Thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers; nevertheless return to Me saith the Lord." Now the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sentence, according to <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>: "You shall hear the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore even those who are guilty of the prostitution of unbelief which is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> prostitution, should be received all the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse22">Matthew 18:22</a>) to forgive his offending brother "not" only "till seven times, but till seventy times seven times," which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds as meaning that "a man should be forgiven, as often as he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." Therefore he ought to be received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as often as he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by falling back into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is a kind of unbelief. Now other unbelievers who wish to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> are received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also should be received.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> Ad abolendam (De Haereticis, cap. ix) says that "those who are found to have relapsed into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they had already abjured, must be left to the secular tribunal." Therefore they should not be received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In obedience to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> institution, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> extends her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to all, not only to friends, but also to foes who persecute her, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a>: "Love your enemies; do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you." Now it is part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that we should both wish and work our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Again, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is twofold: one is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, namely the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is chiefly the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since it is this chiefly that we should wish for one another. Consequently, from this point of view, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who return after falling no matter how often, are admitted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to Penance whereby the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is opened to them.

<p>The other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> considers secondarily, viz. temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as life of the body, worldly possessions, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> repute, ecclesiastical or secular dignity, for we are not bound by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to wish others this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, except in relation to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of them and of others. Hence if the presence of one of these goods in one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> might be an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in many, we are not bound out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to wish such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, rather should we desire him to be without it, both because <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> takes precedence of temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many is to be preferred to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one. Now if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were always received on their return, in order to save their lives and other temporal goods, this might be prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, both because they would infect others if they relapsed again, and because, if they escaped without punishment, others would feel more assured in lapsing into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>): "For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> commit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> without any fear."

<p>For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not only admits to Penance those who return from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> them to be inconstant in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> tribunal, those who return are always received, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a searcher of hearts, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those who return in sincerity. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was speaking to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against oneself, for one should always forgive such offenses and spare our brother when he repents. These words are not to be applied to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against one's neighbor or against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is not left to our discretion to forgive such offenses, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew 18:15</a>, "If thy brother shall offend against thee." Yet even in this matter the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribes limits according as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> demands.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When other unbelievers, who have never received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, they do not as yet show signs of inconstancy in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as relapsed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do; hence the comparison fails.
