<h1>Question 11. The knowledge imprinted or infused in the soul of Christ</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article1"> Does Christ know all things by this knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article2"> Could He use this knowledge by turning to phantasms?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article3"> Was this knowledge collative?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article4"> The comparison of this knowledge with the angelic knowledge</a> <li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article5"> Was it a habitual knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4011.htm#article6"> Was it distinguished by various habits?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether by this imprinted or infused knowledge Christ knew all things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things. For this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is imprinted upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for the perfection of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not seem to be in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to all things simply, but only to those things with regard to which it can be reduced to act by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is its proper motor; and these are knowable by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> what exceeded the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, phantasms are to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as colors to sight, as is said De Anima iii, 18,31,39. But it does not pertain to the perfection of the power of seeing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is without color. Therefore it does not pertain to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things of which there are no phantasms, such as separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Hence, since this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for the perfection of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it seems that by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it does not belong to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singulars. Hence it would seem that by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> singulars.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of wisdom and understanding, of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and counsel shall fill Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> shall rest upon Him, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of wisdom and understanding, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of counsel . . . the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> . . . '; cf. <a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse5">Sirach 15:5</a>," under which are included all that may be <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all Divine things belongs to wisdom, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all immaterial things to understanding, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all conclusions to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> [scientia, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all practical things to counsel. Hence it would seem that by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 9, Article 1), it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should be wholly perfected by having each of its powers reduced to act. Now it must be borne in mind that in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in every creature, there is a double passive power: one in comparison with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent; the other in comparison with the first agent, which can reduce any creature to a higher act than a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent can reduce it, and this is usually called the obediential power of a creature. Now both powers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were reduced to act by this divinely imprinted <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. And hence, by it the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: First, whatever can be <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> by force of a man's active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, e.g. whatever pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; secondly, by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things made <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, whether they belong to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom or the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> these things more fully and completely than others. Yet He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, but by the first alone, of which we spoke above (<a href="#10">Article 10</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This reason refers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in comparison with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent, which is the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the state of this life, since it is somewhat fettered by the body, so as to be unable to understand without phantasms, cannot understand separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. But after the state of this life the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be able, in a measure, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> by itself, as was said in I, 89, 1,2, and this is especially clear as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed. Now before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not merely a wayfarer but also a comprehensor; hence His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in the same way that a separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars pertains to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not in speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but in practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is imperfect without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singulars, in which operations <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, as is said Ethic. vi, 7. Hence for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are required the remembrance of past things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of present things, and foresight of future things, as Tully says (De Invent. ii). Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the fulness of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, He consequently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all singular things--present, past, and future.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ could use this knowledge by turning to phantasms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not understand by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> except by turning to phantasms, because, as is stated De Anima iii, 18,31,39, phantasms are compared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as colors to sight. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power of seeing could not become actual save by turning to colors. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could understand nothing except by turning to phantasms.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as ours. otherwise He would not be of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as we, contrary to what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>) " . . . being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot understand except by turning to phantasms. Hence, neither can <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> otherwise understand.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, senses are given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to help his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could understand without turning to phantasms, which arise in the senses, it would follow that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the senses were useless, which is not fitting. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can only understand by turning to phantasms.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> certain things which could not be <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> by the senses, viz. separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Therefore it could understand without turning to phantasms.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the state before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> Christ was at the same time a wayfarer and a comprehensor, as will be more clearly shown (15, 10). Especially had He the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a wayfarer on the part of the body, which was passible; but the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a comprehensor He had chiefly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now this is the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a comprehensor, viz. that it is nowise subject to its body, or dependent upon it, but wholly dominates it. Hence after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will flow from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on earth needs to turn to phantasms, because it is fettered by the body and in a measure subject to and dependent upon it. And hence the blessed both before and after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> can understand without turning to phantasms. And this must be said of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which had fully the capabilities of a comprehensor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This likeness which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts is not with regard to everything. For it is manifest that the end of the power of seeing is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> colors; but the end of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> phantasms, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which it apprehends from and in phantasms, according to the state of the present life. Therefore there is a likeness in respect of what both powers regard, but not in respect of that in which the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of both powers is terminated. Now nothing prevents a thing in different states from reaching its end by different ways: albeit there is never but one proper end of a thing. Hence, although the sight <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing without color; nevertheless in a certain state the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> without phantasms, but not without intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, yet it had a state which our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have not yet in fact, but only in hope, i.e. the state of comprehension.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could understand without turning to phantasms, yet it could also understand by turning to phantasms. Hence the senses were not useless in it; especially as the senses are not afforded to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> solely for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but for the need of animal life.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether this knowledge is collative?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> by way of comparison. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14): "We do not uphold counsel or choice in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Now these things are withheld from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> only inasmuch as they imply comparison and discursion. Therefore it seems that there was no collative or discursive <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs comparison and discursion of reason in order to find out the unknown. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> everything, as was said above (Question 10, Article 2). Hence there was no discursive or collative <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was like that of comprehensors, who are likened to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a>. Now there is no collative or discursive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> shows (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore there was no discursive or collative <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as was shown (5, 4). Now the proper operation of a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists in comparison and discursion from one thing to another. Therefore there was collative and discursive <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> may be discursive or collative in two ways. First, in the acquisition of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as happens to us, who proceed from one thing to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another, as from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to effects, and conversely. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not discursive or collative, since this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> which we are now considering was divinely infused, and not acquired by a process of reasoning. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be called discursive or collative in use; as at times those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, reason from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to effect, not in order to learn anew, but wishing to use the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they have. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could be collative or discursive; since it could conclude one thing from another, as it pleased, as in <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse24">Matthew 17:24-25</a>, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> asked Peter: "Of whom do the kings of the earth receive tribute, of their own children, or of strangers?" On Peter replying: "Of strangers," He concluded: "Then the children are free."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> From <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is excluded that counsel which is with <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and consequently choice, which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> includes such counsel; but the practice of using counsel is not excluded from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This reason rests upon discursion and comparison, as used to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The blessed are likened to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>; yet there still remains the difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. And hence to use comparison and discursion is connatural to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed, but not to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether in Christ this knowledge was greater than the knowledge of the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was not greater in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For perfection is proportioned to the thing perfected. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is below the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> we are now speaking of is imprinted upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for its perfection, it seems that this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is less than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is perfected.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in a measure comparative and discursive, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was less than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more immaterial <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is, the greater it is. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is more immaterial than the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the act of a body, and turns to phantasms, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>): "For we see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Who was made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for the suffering of death, crowned with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>"; from which it is plain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> only in regard to the suffering of death. And hence, not in <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be looked at in two ways: First, as regards what it has from the inflowing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; secondly, as regards what it has from the subject receiving it. Now with regard to the first, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, both in the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> light, which is imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is much more excellent than the light which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But as regards the second, the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is less than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in the manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, i.e. by turning to phantasms, and by comparison and discursion.

<p>And hereby the reply to the objections is made clear.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether this knowledge was habitual?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. For it has been said (9, 1) that the highest perfection of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> befitted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the perfection of an actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is greater than that of a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a> or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore it was fitting for Him to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things actually. Therefore He had not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are ordained to acts, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is never reduced to act would seem useless. Now, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all things, as was said 10, 2, He could not have considered all things actually, thinking over one after another, since the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be passed over by enumeration. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain things would have been useless to Him--which is unfitting. Therefore He had an actual and not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of what He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a perfection of the knower. But perfection is more noble than the thing perfected. If, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, it would follow that this <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing was nobler than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> we are now speaking about was univocal with our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, even as His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> as ours. But our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in the genus of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> impressed on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> befitted the subject receiving it. For the received is in the recipient after the mode of the recipient. Now the connatural mode of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is that it should understand sometimes actually, and sometimes <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>. But the medium between a pure power and a completed act is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and extremes and medium are of the same genus. Thus it is plain that it is the connatural mode of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Hence it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>, for He could use it when He pleased.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there was a twofold <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>--each most perfect of its kind: the first exceeding the mode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as by it He saw the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and other things in It, and this was the most perfect, simply. Nor was this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>, but actual with respect to everything He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> in this way. But the second <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a manner proportioned to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e. inasmuch as He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> things by <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> divinely imprinted upon Him, and of this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> we are now speaking. Now this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was not most perfect, simply, but merely in the genus of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence it did not behoove it to be always in act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Habits are reduced to act by the command of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is that "with which we act when we wish." Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is indeterminate in regard to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things. Yet it is not useless, even when it does not actually tend to all; provided it actually tends to everything in fitting place and time. And hence neither is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> useless, even if all that it extends to is not reduced to act; provided that that which befits the due end of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be reduced to act according as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in hand and the time require.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Goodness and being are taken in two ways: First, simply; and thus a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which subsists in its being and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and a being; secondly, being and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are taken relatively, and in this way an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> is a being and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not that it has being and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but that its subject is a being and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And hence <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not simply better or more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ; but relatively, since the whole <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is added to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the subject.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether this knowledge was distinguished by divers habits?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is, the more united it is; hence the higher <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand by the more universal forms, as was said in I, 55, 3. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was most perfect. Therefore it was most one. Therefore it was not distinguished by several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a>): "Looking on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the author and finisher of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But there is only one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about all things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, as was said in the II-II, 4, 6. Much more, therefore, was there only one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is distinguished by the divers formalities of knowable things. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> everything under one formality, i.e. by a divinely infused light. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was only one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse9">Zechariah 3:9</a>) that on "one" stone, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "there are seven eyes." Now by the eye is understood <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were several <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (4,5), the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a mode connatural to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now it is connatural to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a lesser universality than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> receive; so that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> different specific natures by different intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But it so happens that we have different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because there are different classes of knowable things, inasmuch as what are in one genus are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by one <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; thus it is said (Poster. i, 42) that "one science is of one class of object." And hence the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was distinguished by different <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As was said (4), the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is most perfect, and exceeds the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with regard to what is in it on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>; but it is below the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as regards the mode of the recipient. And it pertains to this mode that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is distinguished by various <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, inasmuch as it regards more particular <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rests upon the First Truth; and hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the author of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is simply one.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The divinely infused light is the common formality for understanding what is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a>, as the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is with regard to what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there must be the proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of singular things, in order to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> each with proper <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>; and in this way there must be divers <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above.
