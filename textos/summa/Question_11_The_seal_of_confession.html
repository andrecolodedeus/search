<h1>Question 11. The seal of confession</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5011.htm#article1"> Is a man bound to hide what he knows under the seal of confession in every case?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5011.htm#article2"> Does the seal of confession extend to other matters than those which have reference to confession?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5011.htm#article3"> Is the priest alone bound by the seal of confession?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5011.htm#article4"> Can a priest, by permission of the penitent, make known to another, a sin of his which he knew under the seal of confession?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5011.htm#article5"> Is he bound to hide even what he knows through other sources besides?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in every case the priest is bound to hide the sins which he knows under the seal of confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not bound in every case to hide the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> under the seal of confession. For, as <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Proecep. et Dispens. ii), "that which is instituted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now the secret of confession would militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in certain cases: for instance, if a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> through confession that a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whom he cannot persuade to desist from misleading the people; or, in like manner, if a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, through confession, that certain people who wish to marry are related to one another. Therefore such ought to reveal what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is obligatory solely on account of a precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> need not be observed, if the commandment be changed to the contrary. Now the secret of confession was introduced solely by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were to prescribe that anyone who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything about such and such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, a man that had such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through confession would be bound to speak.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man is bound to safeguard his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> name of another, because there is order in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now it happens sometimes that a man by hiding a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injures his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>--for instance, if he be called upon to give witness of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through confession, and is forced to swear to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>--or when an abbot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through confession the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a prior who is subject to him, which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be an occasion of ruin to the latter, if he suffers him to retain his priorship, wherefore he is bound to deprive him of the dignity of his pastoral charge, and yet in depriving him he seem to divulge the secret of confession. Therefore it seems that in certain cases it is lawful to reveal a confession.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is possible for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> through hearing a man's confession to be conscious that the latter is unworthy of ecclesiastical preferment. Now everyone is bound to prevent the promotion of the unworthy, if it is his business. Since then by raising an objection he seems to raise a suspicion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so to reveal the confession somewhat, it seems that it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sometimes to divulge a confession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> says (De Poenit. et Remiss., Cap. Omnis utriusque): "Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> beware lest he betray the sinner, by word, or sign, or in any other way whatever."

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should conform himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose minister he is. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not reveal the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Him in confession, but hides them. Neither, therefore, should the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> reveal them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those things which are done outwardly in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are the signs of what takes place inwardly: wherefore confession, whereby a man subjects himself to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is a sign of the inward submission, whereby one submits to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hides the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who submit to Him by Penance; wherefore this also should be signified in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, and consequently the sacrament demands that the confession should remain hidden, and he who divulges a confession <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by violating the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Besides this there are other advantages in this secrecy, because thereby men are more attracted to confession, and confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with greater simplicity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some say that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not bound by the seal of confession to hide other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than those in respect of which the penitent promises amendment; otherwise he may reveal them to one who can be a help and not a hindrance. But this opinion seems <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, since it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the sacrament; for just as, though the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> be insincere, yet his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, and there is no change in the essentials of the sacrament on that account, so confession does not cease to be sacramental although he that confesses, does not purpose amendment. Therefore, this notwithstanding, it must be held secret; nor does the seal of confession militate against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> on that account, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not require a man to find a remedy for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not: and that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in confession, is, as it were, unknown, since a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it. Nevertheless in the cases quoted one should apply some kind of remedy, so far as this can be done without divulging the confession, e.g. by admonishing the penitent, and by watching over the others lest they be corrupted by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He can also tell the prelate to watch over his flock with great care, yet so as by neither word nor sign to betray the penitent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The precept concerning the secret of confession follows from the sacrament itself. Wherefore just as the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of making a sacramental confession is of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, so that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> dispensation or command can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> one therefrom, even so, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be forced or permitted by another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to divulge the secret of confession. Consequently if he be commanded under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to be incurred "ipso facto," to say whether he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything about such and such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he ought not to say it, because he should assume that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in commanding him thus, was that he should say what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And even if he were expressly interrogated about a confession, he ought to say nothing, nor would he incur the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, for he is not subject to his superior, save as a man, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this not as a man, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not called upon to witness except as a man, wherefore without wronging his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> he can swear that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it. In like manner a superior can, without wronging his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, leave a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unpunished which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, or he may forbear to apply a remedy, since he is not bound to apply a remedy, except according as it comes to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore with regard to matters which come to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the tribunal of Penance, he should apply the remedy, as far as he can, in the same court: thus as to the case in point, the abbot should advise the prior to resign his office, and if the latter refuse, he can <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> him from the priorship on some other occasion, yet so as to avoid all suspicion of divulging the confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is rendered unworthy of ecclesiastical preferment, by many other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> besides <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance, by lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, age, or the like: so that by raising an objection one does not raise a suspicion of crime or divulge the secret of confession.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the seal of confession extends to other matters than those which have reference to confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the seal of confession extends to other matters besides those which have reference to confession. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> alone have reference to confession. Now sometimes besides <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> other matters are told which have no reference to confession. Therefore, since such things are told to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it seems that the seal of confession extends to them also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, sometimes one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> tells another a secret, which the latter receives under the seal of confession. Therefore the seal of confession extends to matters having no relation to confession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The seal of confession is connected with sacramental confession. But those things which are connected with a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, do not extend outside the bounds of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore the seal of confession does not extend to matters other than those which have reference to sacramental confession.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The seal of confession does not extend directly to other matters than those which have reference to sacramental confession, yet indirectly matters also which are not connected with sacramental confession are affected by the seal of confession, those, for instance, which might lead to the discovery of a sinner or of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless these matters also must be most carefully hidden, both on account of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and to avoid leading others into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through their becoming familiar with it.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A confidence ought not easily to be accepted in this way: but if it be done the secret must be kept in the way promised, as though one had the secret through confession, though not through the seal of confession.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the priest alone is bound by the seal of confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound by the seal of confession. For sometimes a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> hears a confession through an interpreter, if there be an urgent reason for so doing. But it seems that the interpreter is bound to keep the confession secret. Therefore one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something under the seal of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is possible sometimes in cases of urgency for a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> to hear a confession. But he is bound to secrecy with regard to those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since they are told to him as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound by the seal of confession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it may happen that a man pretends to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so that by this deceit he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is on another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: and it would seem that he also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he divulges the confession. Therefore not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound by the seal of confession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone is the minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. But the seal of confession is connected with this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone is bound by the seal of confession.

<p>Further, the reason why a man is bound to keep secret what he hears in confession, is because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister. Therefore he alone is bound to secrecy.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The seal of confession affects the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as minister of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: which seal is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of keeping the confession secret, even as the key is the power of absolving. Yet, as one who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in a particular case has a kind of share in the act of the keys, when he hears a confession in a case of urgency, so also does he have a certain share in the act of the seal of confession, and is bound to secrecy, though, properly speaking, he is not bound by the seal of confession.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether by the penitent's permission, a priest may reveal to another a sin which he knows under the seal of confession?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may not, by the penitent's permission, reveal to another a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> under the seal of confession. For an inferior may not do what his superior may not. Now the Pope cannot give permission for anyone to divulge a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through confession. Neither therefore can the penitent give him such a permission.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is instituted for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be changed at the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. Now the secrecy of confession was instituted for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in order that men might have greater confidence in approaching the confessional. Therefore the penitent cannot allow the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to divulge his confession.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could grant such a permission, this would seem to palliate the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of bad <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, for they might pretend to have received the permission and so they might <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with impunity, which would be unbecoming. Therefore it seems that the penitent cannot grant this permission.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the one to whom this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is divulged does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> under the seal of confession, so that he may publish a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is already blotted out, which is unbecoming. Therefore this permission cannot be granted.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If the sinner consent, a superior may refer him by letter to an inferior <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Therefore with the consent of the penitent, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may reveal a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his to another.

<p>Further, whosoever can do a thing of his own authority, can do it through another. But the penitent can by his own authority reveal his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to another. Therefore he can do it through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> There are two reasons for which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound to keep a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> secret: first and chiefly, because this very secrecy is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose place he holds in confession: secondly, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Now the penitent can make the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as a man, what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> before only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, and he does this when he allows him to divulge it: so that if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does reveal it, he does not break the seal of confession. Nevertheless he should beware of giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> by revealing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest he be deemed to have broken the seal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Pope cannot permit a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to divulge a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he cannot make him to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as a man, whereas he that has confessed it, can.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When that is told which was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another source, that which is instituted for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not done away with, because the seal of confession is not broken.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This does not bestow impunity on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, because they are in danger of having to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that they had the penitent's permission to reveal the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if they should be accused of the contrary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> He that is informed of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with the penitent's consent, shares in an act of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a>, so that the same applies to him as to an interpreter, unless perchance the penitent wish him to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it unconditionally and freely.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether a man may reveal that which he knows through confession and through some other source besides?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man may not reveal what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through confession and through some other source besides. For the seal of confession is not broken unless one reveals a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through confession. If therefore a man divulges a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through confession, no matter how he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it otherwise, he seems to break the seal.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever hears someone's confession, is under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to him not to divulge his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now if one were to promise someone to keep something secret, he would be bound to do so, even if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it through some other source. Therefore a man is bound to keep secret what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through the confession, no matter how he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it otherwise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the stronger of two things draws the other to itself. Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, is stronger and more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it draws the latter to itself: and consequently a man cannot reveal that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because this is demanded by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the secrecy of confession was instituted in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and to prevent men being shy of going to confession. But if a man might say what he had heard in confession, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it otherwise, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> would result all the same. Therefore he can nowise say what he has heard.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No one can put another under a new <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, unless he be his superior, who can bind him by a precept. Now he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by witnessing it was not bound to keep it secret. Therefore he that confesses to him, not being his superior, cannot put him under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of secrecy by confessing to him.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be hindered if a man, in order to escape a sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, incurred on account of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of which he has been convicted, were to confess to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has to sentence him. Now the execution of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> falls under a precept. Therefore a man is not bound to keep a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> secret, which he has heard in confession, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> from some other source.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There are three opinions about this question. For some say that a man can by no means tell another what he has heard in confession, even if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it from some other source either before or after the confession: while others assert that the confession debars him from speaking of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> already, but not from saying what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> afterwards and in another way. Now both these opinions, by exaggerating the seal of confession, are prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For a man might be more inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if he had no fear of being accused by his confessor supposing that he repeated the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in his presence: and furthermore it would be most prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> if a man could not bear witness to a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which he has seen committed again after being confessed to him. Nor does it matter that, as some say, he ought to declare that he cannot keep it secret, for he cannot make such a declaration until the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has already been confessed to him, and then every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could, if he wished, divulge a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by making such a declaration, if this made him free to divulge it. Consequently there is a third and truer opinion, viz. that what a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through another source either before or after confession, he is not bound to keep secret, in so far as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it as a man, for he can say: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so end so since I saw it." But he is bound to keep it secret in so far as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, for he cannot say: "I heard so and so in confession." Nevertheless, on account of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> he should refrain from speaking of it unless there is an urgent reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If a man says that he has seen what he has heard in the confessional, he does not reveal what he heard in confession, save indirectly: even as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something through hearing and seeing it, does not, properly speaking, divulge what he saw, if he says he heard it, but only indirectly, because he says he has heard what he incidentally saw. Wherefore he does not break the seal of confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The confessor is not forbidden to reveal a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> simply, but to reveal it as heard in confession: for in no case is he allowed to say that he has heard it in the confessional.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of things that are in opposition to one another: whereas to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, are not in opposition; so that the argument proves nothing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It would not be right to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> so as to desert <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should not be gainsayed for fear of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Wherefore when <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are in the balance, a man should not be deterred by the fear of giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, from divulging what he has heard in confession, provided he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it from some other source: although he ought to avoid giving <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, as far as he is able.
