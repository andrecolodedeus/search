<h1>Question 120. "Epikeia" or equity</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3120.htm#article1"> Is "epikeia" a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3120.htm#article2"> Is it a part of justice?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether "epikeia" [<em>epieikeia</em>] is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that "epikeia" is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does away with another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet "epikeia" does away with another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it sets aside that which is just according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and seemingly is opposed to severity. Therefore "epikeia" is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "With regard to these earthly laws, although men pass judgment on them when they make them, yet, when once they are made and established, the judge must pronounce judgment not on them but according to them." But seemingly "epikeia" pronounces judgment on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, when it deems that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should not be observed in some particular case. Therefore "epikeia" is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> rather than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, apparently it belongs to "epikeia" to consider the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 10). But it belongs to the sovereign alone to interpret the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, wherefore the Emperor says in the Codex of Laws and Constitutions, under Law i: "It is fitting and lawful that We alone should interpret between equity and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." Therefore the act of "epikeia" is unlawful: and consequently "epikeia" is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 10) states it to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 96, 6), when we were treating of laws, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, with which laws are concerned, are composed of contingent singulars and are innumerable in their diversity, it was not possible to lay down rules of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that would apply to every single case. Legislators in framing laws attend to what commonly happens: although if the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> be applied to certain cases it will frustrate the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and be injurious to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has in view. Thus the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> requires deposits to be restored, because in the majority of cases this is just. Yet it happens sometimes to be injurious--for instance, if a madman were to put his sword in deposit, and demand its delivery while in a state of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, or if a man were to seek the return of his deposit in order to fight against his country. On these and like cases it is bad to follow the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to set aside the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and to follow the dictates of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. This is the object of "epikeia" which we call equity. Therefore it is evident that "epikeia" is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Epikeia" does not set aside that which is just in itself but that which is just as by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> established. Nor is it opposed to severity, which follows the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> when it ought to be followed. To follow the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> when it ought not to be followed is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Hence it is written in the Codex of Laws and Constitutions under Law v: "Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he transgresses the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> who by adhering to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> strives to defeat the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It would be passing judgment on a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to say that it was not well made; but to say that the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not to be observed in some particular case is passing judgment not on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but on some particular contingency.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Interpretation is admissible in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> cases where it is not allowed to set aside the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without the interpretation of the sovereign. But when the case is manifest there is need, not of interpretation, but of execution.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether "epikeia" is a part of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that "epikeia" is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For, as stated above (Question 58, Article 07), <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is twofold, particular and legal. Now "epikeia" is not a part of particular <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since it extends to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, even as legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does. On like manner, neither is it a part of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since its operation is beside that which is established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Therefore it seems that "epikeia" is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a more principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not assigned as the part of a less principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for it is to the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as being principal, that secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are assigned as parts. Now "epikeia" seems to be a more principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as implied by its name: for it is derived from <em>epi</em>, i.e. "above," and <em>dikaion</em>, i.e. "just." Therefore "epikeia" is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems that "epikeia" is the same as modesty. For where the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians 4:5</a>), "Let your modesty be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," the Greek has <em>epieikeia</em> [<em>to epieikes</em>]. Now, according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii), modesty is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore "epikeia" is not a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 10) that "epikeia is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#48">Article 48</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has three kinds of parts, subjective, integral, and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. A subjective part is one of which the whole is predicated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and it is less than the whole. This may happen in two ways. For sometimes one thing is predicated of many in one common ratio, as animal of horse and ox: and sometimes one thing is predicated of many according to priority and posteriority, as "being" of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>.

<p>Accordingly, "epikeia" is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> taken in a general sense, for it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 10). Wherefore it is evident that "epikeia" is a subjective part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is predicated of it with priority to being predicated of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is subject to the direction of "epikeia." Hence "epikeia" is by way of being a higher rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Epikeia corresponds properly to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and in one way is contained under it, and in another way exceeds it. For if legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> denotes that which complies with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, whether as regards the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or as regards the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the lawgiver, which is of more account, then "epikeia" is the more important part of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But if legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> denote merely that which complies with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with regard to the letter, then "epikeia" is a part not of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in its general acceptation, and is condivided with legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as exceeding it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. v, 10), "epikeia is better than a certain," namely, legal, "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," which observes the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: yet since it is itself a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it is not better than all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to "epikeia" to moderate something, namely, the observance of the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But modesty, which is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, moderates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> outward life--for instance, in his deportment, dress or the like. Possibly also the term <em>epieikeia</em> is applied in Greek by a similitude to all kinds of moderation.
