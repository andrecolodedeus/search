<h1>Question 121. Piety</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3121.htm#article1"> Is it a gift of the Holy Ghost?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3121.htm#article2"> Which of the beatitudes and fruits corresponds to it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether piety is a gift?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that piety is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 1). But piety is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 101, Article 3). Therefore piety is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, above all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as above (I-II, 68, 8). Now among the parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> religion is greater than piety. Therefore if any part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to be accounted a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, it seems that religion should be a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> rather than piety.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and their acts remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 6). But the act of piety cannot remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i) that "piety fills the inmost recesses of the heart with <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a>": and so there will be no piety in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> since there will be no unhappiness [Cf. 30, 1]. Therefore piety is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>'] ["Pietas," whence our English word "pity," which is the same as mercy.]

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 68, 1; I-II, 69, 1,3), the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> dispositions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, rendering it amenable to the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moves us to this effect among others, of having a filial affection towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a>, "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba</a> (Father)." And since it belongs properly to piety to pay <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and worship to one's father, it follows that piety, whereby, at the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost's</a> instigation, we pay worship and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as our Father, is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The piety that pays <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and worship to a father in the flesh is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but the piety that is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> pays this to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Father.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To pay worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Creator, as religion does, is more excellent than to pay worship to one's father in the flesh, as the piety that is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does. But to pay worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Father is yet more excellent than to pay worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Creator and Lord. Wherefore religion is greater than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of piety: while the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety is greater than religion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of piety <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pays <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and worship not only to his father in the flesh, but also to all his kindred on account of their being related to his father so by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety he pays worship and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> not only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on account of their relationship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it belongs to piety to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and not to contradict the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> whether one understands them or not, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii). Consequently it also assists those who are in a state of unhappiness. And although this act has no place in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, especially after the Day of Judgment, yet piety will exercise its principal act, which is to revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with filial affection: for it is then above all that this act will be fulfilled, according to <a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse5">Wisdom 5:5</a>, "Behold how they are numbered among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will also mutually <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> one another. Now, however, before the Judgment Day, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have pity on those also who are living in this unhappy state.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," corresponds to the gift of piety?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety. For piety is the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> corresponding to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to which rather belongs the fourth beatitude, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," or the fifth beatitude, "Blessed are the merciful," since as stated above (1, Objection 3), the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">works of mercy</a> belong to piety. Therefore the second beatitude does not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety is directed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is united to it in the enumeration of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm">Isaiah 11</a>). Now direction and execution extend to the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Since, then, the third beatitude, "Blessed are they that mourn," corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it seems that the second beatitude corresponds to piety.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruits correspond to the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (I-II, 70, 2). Now among the fruits, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and benignity seem to agree with piety rather than mildness, which pertains to meekness. Therefore the second beatitude does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i): "Piety is becoming to the meek."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In adapting the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> a twofold congruity may be observed. One is according to the order in which they are given, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> seems to have followed this: wherefore he assigns the first beatitude to the lowest <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, namely, fear, and the second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," to piety, and so on. Another congruity may be observed in keeping with the special <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> and beatitude. On this way one must adapt the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to their objects and acts: and thus the fourth and fifth <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> would correspond to piety, rather than the second. Yet the second beatitude has a certain congruity with piety, inasmuch as meekness removes the obstacles to acts of piety.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Taking the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to their proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the same beatitude must needs correspond to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and piety: but taking them according to their order, different <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> correspond to them, although a certain congruity may be observed, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the fruits <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and benignity may be directly ascribed to piety; and mildness indirectly in so far as it removes obstacles to acts of piety, as stated above.
