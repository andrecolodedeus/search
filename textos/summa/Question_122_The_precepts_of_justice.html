<h1>Question 122. The precepts of justice</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article1"> Are the precepts of the decalogue precepts of justice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article2"> The first precept of the decalogue</a> <li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article3"> The second</a> <li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article4"> The third</a> <li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article5"> The fourth</a> <li><a href="../summa/3122.htm#article6"> The other six</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the precepts of the decalogue are precepts of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are not precepts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of a lawgiver is "to make the citizens <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in respect of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as stated in Ethic. ii, 1. Wherefore, according to Ethic. v, 1, "the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribes about all acts of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are the first. principles of the whole Divine Law. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> do not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it would seem that to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> belong especially the judicial precepts, which are condivided with the moral precepts, as stated above (I-II, 99, 4). But the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are moral precepts, as stated above (I-II, 100, 3). Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are not precepts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contains chiefly precepts about acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regarding the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for instance about public officers and the like. But there is no mention of these in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Therefore it seems that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> do not properly belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are divided into two tables, corresponding to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the love of our neighbor, both of which regard the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Seemingly <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the sole <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby we are directed to another. Now we are directed to another by all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as is evident if one consider each of them. Therefore all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are the first principles of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> assents to them at once, as to principles that are most evident. Now it is altogether evident that the notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a precept, appears in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is of one towards another. Because in those matters that relate to himself it would seem at a glance that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is master of himself, and that he may do as he likes: whereas in matters that refer to another it appears manifestly that a man is under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to render to another that which is his due. Hence the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> must needs pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Wherefore the first three precepts are about acts of religion, which is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; the fourth precept is about acts of piety, which is the second part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and the six remaining are about <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> commonly so called, which is observed among equals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is to make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, but in a certain order, namely, by first of all giving them precepts about those things where the notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is most manifest, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The judicial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts, in so far as these are directed to one's neighbor, just as the ceremonial precepts are determinations of the moral precepts in so far as these are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence neither precepts are contained in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: and yet they are determinations of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, and therefore pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things that concern the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> must needs be administered in different ways according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Hence they were to be given a place not among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, but among the judicial precepts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> pertain to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as their end, according to <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>, "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>": but they belong to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, inasmuch as they refer immediately to acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the first precept of the decalogue is fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the first precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is unfittingly expressed. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to his father in the flesh, according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse9">Hebrews 12:9</a>, "How much more shall we [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'shall we not much more'] obey the Father of spirits and live?" Now the precept of piety, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> honors his father, is expressed affirmatively in these words: "Honor thy father and thy mother." Much more, therefore, should the first precept of religion, whereby all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be expressed affirmatively, especially as affirmation is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> prior to negation.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the first precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> pertains to religion, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now religion, since it is one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, has one act. Yet in the first precept three acts are forbidden: since we read first: "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me"; secondly, "Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven thing"; and thirdly, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them nor serve them." Therefore the first precept is unfittingly expressed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De decem chord. ix) that "the first precept forbids the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>." But there are many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> superstitions besides <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, as stated above (Question 92, Article 2). Therefore it was insufficient to forbid <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> alone.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It pertains to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to make men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherefore it behooved the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be set in order according to the order of generation, the order, to wit, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> becoming <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now two things must be observed in the order of generation. The first is that the first part is the first thing to be established; thus in the generation of an animal the first thing to be formed is the heart, and in building a home the first thing to be set up is the foundation: and in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the first part is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the result of which is that a man makes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of every other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> depends on its object, which is its end. Wherefore since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was to be directed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, the first thing <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> was, as it were, to lay the foundation of religion, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is duly directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will.

<p>The second thing to be observed in the order of generation is that in the first place contraries and obstacles have to be removed. Thus the farmer first purifies the soil, and afterwards sows his seed, according to <a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 4:3</a>, "Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon thorns." Hence it behooved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, first of all to be instructed in religion, so as to remove the obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Now the chief obstacle to religion is for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to adhere to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> god, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew 6:24</a>, "You cannot serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>." Therefore in the first precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> the worship of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods is excluded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In point of fact there is one affirmative precept about religion, namely: "Remember that thou keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath Day</a>." Still the negative precepts had to be given first, so that by their means the obstacles to religion might be removed. For though affirmation <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes negation, yet in the process of generation, negation, whereby obstacles are removed, comes first, as stated in the Article. Especially is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in matters concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where negation is preferable to affirmation, on account of our insufficiency, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> observes (Coel. Hier. ii).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> People worshiped strange gods in two ways. For some served certain creatures as gods without having recourse to images. Hence Varro says that for a long time the ancient Romans worshiped gods without using images: and this worship is first forbidden by the words, "Thou shalt not have strange gods." Among others the worship of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods was observed by using certain images: and so the very making of images was fittingly forbidden by the words, "Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven thing," as also the worship of those same images, by the words, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All other kinds of superstition proceed from some compact, tacit or explicit, with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; hence all are understood to be forbidden by the words, "Thou shalt not have strange gods."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the second precept of the decalogue is fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the second precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> is unfittingly expressed. For this precept, "Thou shalt not take the name of thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain" is thus explained by a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus 20:7</a>: "Thou shalt not deem the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be a creature," so that it forbids an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Again, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words of <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>, "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain, " adds, i.e. "by giving the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to wood or stone," as though they forbade a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which, like <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is an act of unbelief. Now unbelief precedes superstition, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes religion. Therefore this precept should have preceded the first, whereby superstition is forbidden.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is taken for many purposes --for instance, those of praise, of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and generally speaking in conjunction with all we say or do, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse17">Colossians 3:17</a>, "All whatsoever you do in word or in work . . . do ye in the name of the Lord." Therefore the precept forbidding the taking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name in vain seems to be more universal than the precept forbidding superstition, and thus should have preceded it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus 20:7</a> expounds the precept, "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain," namely, by swearing to nothing. Hence this precept would seem to forbid useless swearing, that is to say, swearing without judgment. But <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> swearing, which is without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> swearing, which is without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, are much more grievous. Therefore this precept should rather have forbidden them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or any word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that is an insult to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is much more grievous than perjury. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and other like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should rather have been forbidden by this precept.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> names are many. Therefore it should not have been said indefinitely: "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In one who is being instructed in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to remove obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion before establishing him in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Now a thing is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion in two ways. First, by excess, when, to wit, that which belongs to religion is given to others than to whom it is due, and this pertains to superstition. Secondly, by lack, as it were, of reverence, when, to wit, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is contemned, and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of irreligion, as stated above (97, in the preamble, and in the Article that follows). Now superstition hinders religion by preventing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from acknowledging <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so as to worship Him: and when a man's mind is engrossed in some undue worship, he cannot at the same time give due worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse20">Isaiah 28:20</a>, "The bed is straitened, so that one must fall out," i.e. either the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> god must fall out from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart, "and a short covering cannot cover both." On the other hand, irreligion hinders religion by preventing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from honoring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after he has acknowledged Him. Now one must first of all acknowledge <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with a view to worship, before honoring Him we have acknowledged.

<p>For this reason the precept forbidding superstition is placed before the second precept, which forbids perjury that pertains to irreligion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These expositions are mystical. The literal explanation is that which is given <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy 5:11</a>: "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain," namely, "by swearing on that which is not [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'for he shall not be unpunished that taketh His name upon a vain thing']."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This precept does not forbid all taking of the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but properly the taking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name in confirmation of a man's word by way of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, because men are wont to take <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name more frequently in this way. Nevertheless we may understand that in consequence all inordinate taking of the Divine name is forbidden by this precept: and it is in this sense that we are to take the explanation quoted in the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To swear to nothing means to swear to that which is not. This pertains to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> swearing, which is chiefly called perjury, as stated above (98, 1, ad 3). For when a man swears to that which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, his swearing is vain in itself, since it is not supported by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. on the other hand, when a man swears without judgment, through levity, if he swear to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is no vanity on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> itself, but only on the part of the swearer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Just as when we instruct a man in some science, we begin by putting before him certain general maxims, even so the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which forms <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by instructing him in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, which are the first of all precepts, gave expression, by prohibition or by command, to those things which are of most common occurrence in the course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Hence the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> include the prohibition of perjury, which is of more frequent occurrence than <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not fall so often into the latter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Reverence is due to the Divine names on the part of the thing signified, which is one, and not on the part of the signifying words, which are many. Hence it is expressed in the singular: "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain": since it matters not in which of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> names perjury is committed.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the third precept of the decalogue, concerning the hallowing of the Sabbath, is fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the third precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, concerning the hallowing of the Sabbath, is unfittingly expressed. For this, understood spiritually, is a general precept: since <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse14">Luke 13:14</a>, "The ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that He had healed on the Sabbath," says (Comment. iv): "The Law forbids, not to heal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the Sabbath, but to do servile works," i.e. "to burden oneself with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Taken literally it is a ceremonial precept, for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse13">Exodus 31:13</a>): "See that you keep My Sabbath: because it is a sign between Me and you in your generations." Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and moral. Therefore it is unfittingly placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the ceremonial precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> contain "sacred things, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and observances," as stated above (I-II, 101, 4). Now sacred things comprised not only sacred days, but also sacred places and sacred vessels, and so on. Moreover, there were many sacred days other than the Sabbath. Therefore it was unfitting to omit all other ceremonial observances and to mention only that of the Sabbath.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever breaks a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> some who broke the observances of the Sabbath did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--for instance, those who <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> their sons on the eighth day, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who worked in the temple on the Sabbath. Also Elias (<a href="../bible/1ki019.htm">1 Kings 19</a>), who journeyed for forty days unto the mount of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Horeb, must have traveled on a Sabbath: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also who carried the ark of the Lord for seven days, as related in <a href="../bible/jos007.htm">Joshua 7</a>, must be understood to have carried it on a Sabbath. Again it is written (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse15">Luke 13:15</a>): "Doth not every one of you on the Sabbath day loose his ox or his ass . . . and lead them to water?" Therefore it is unfittingly placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> have to be observed also under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>. Yet in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> this precept is not observed, neither in the point of the Sabbath day, nor as to the Lord's day, on which men cook their food, travel, fish, and do many like things. Therefore the precept of the observance of the Sabbath is unfittingly expressed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion being removed by the first and second precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as stated above (2,3), it remained for the third precept to be given whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is established in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Now it belongs to religion to give worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and just as the Divine scriptures teach the interior worship under the guise of certain corporal similitudes, so is external worship given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the guise of sensible signs. And since for the most part <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is induced to pay interior worship, consisting in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and devotion, by the interior prompting of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, a precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> respecting the exterior worship that consists in sensible signs. Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are, so to speak, first and common principles of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, and consequently the third precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> describes the exterior worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the sign of a universal boon that concerns all. This universal boon was the work of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a> of the world, from which work <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is stated to have rested on the seventh day: and sign of this we are commanded to keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seventh day--that is, to set it aside as a day to be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence after the precept about the hallowing of the Sabbath the reason for it is given: "For in six days the Lord made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth . . . and rested on the seventh day."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The precept about hallowing the Sabbath, understood literally, is partly moral and partly ceremonial. It is a moral precept in the point of commanding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to aside a certain time to be given to Divine things. For there is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to set aside a certain time for each <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing, such as refreshment of the body, sleep, and so forth. Hence according to the dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sets aside a certain time for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> refreshment, by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is refreshed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus to have a certain time set aside for occupying oneself with Divine things is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a moral precept. But, in so far as this precept specializes the time as a sign representing the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a> of the world, it is a ceremonial precept. Again, it is a ceremonial precept in its allegorical signification, as representative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> rest in the tomb on the seventh day: also in its moral signification, as representing cessation from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts, and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> rest in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which sense, too, it is a general precept. Again, it is a ceremonial precept in its analogical signification, as foreshadowing the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Hence the precept about hallowing the Sabbath is placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, as a moral, but not as a ceremonial precept.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The other ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are signs of certain particular Divine works: but the observance of the Sabbath is representative of a general boon, namely, the production of all creatures. Hence it was fitting that it should be placed among the general precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, rather than any other ceremonial precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two things are to be observed in the hallowing of the Sabbath. One of these is the end: and this is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> occupy himself with Divine things, and is signified in the words: "Remember that thou keep <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the Sabbath day." For in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> those things are said to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> which are applied to the Divine worship. The other thing is cessation from work, and is signified in the words (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse11">Exodus 20:11</a>), "On the seventh day . . . thou shalt do no work." The kind of work meant appears from <a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse3">Leviticus 23:3</a>, "You shall do no servile work on that day [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'You shall do no work on that day']." Now servile work is so called from servitude: and servitude is threefold. One, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a>, "Whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," and in this sense all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts are servile. Another servitude is whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> serves another. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> serves another not with his mind but with his body, as stated above (104, 5,6, ad 1). Wherefore in this respect those works are called servile whereby one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> serves another. The third is the servitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in this way the work of worship, which pertains to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be called a servile work. On this sense servile work is not forbidden on the Sabbath day, because that would be contrary to the end of the Sabbath observance: since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abstains from other works on the Sabbath day in order that he may occupy himself with works connected with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. For this reason, according to <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>, "a man [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'If a man,' etc.] receives <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the Sabbath day, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> may not be broken": and for this reason too we read (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse5">Matthew 12:5</a>), that "on the Sabbath days the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the temple break the Sabbath," i.e. do corporal works on the Sabbath, "and are without blame." Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in carrying the ark on the Sabbath did not break the precept of the Sabbath observance. On like manner it is not contrary to the observance of the Sabbath to exercise any <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> act, such as teaching by word or writing. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/num028.htm">Numbers 28</a> says that "smiths and like craftsmen rest on the Sabbath day, but the reader or teacher of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> does not cease from his work. Yet he profanes not the Sabbath, even as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the temple break the Sabbath, and are without blame." On the other hand, those works that are called servile in the first or second way are contrary to the observance of the Sabbath, in so far as they hinder <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from applying himself to Divine things. And since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is hindered from applying himself to Divine things rather by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> than by lawful albeit corporal works, it follows that to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on a feast day is more against this precept than to do some other but lawful bodily work. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De decem chord. iii): "It would be better if the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> did some useful work on his farm than spent his time seditiously in the theatre: and their womenfolk would do better to be making linen on the Sabbath than to be dancing lewdly all day in their feasts of the new moon." It is not, however, against this precept to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venially on the Sabbath, because venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not destroy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.

<p>Again, corporal works, not pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are said to be servile in so far as they belong properly to servants; while they are not said to be servile, in so far as they are common to those who serve and those who are free. Moreover, everyone, be he servant or free, is bound to provide necessaries both for himself and for his neighbor, chiefly in respect of things pertaining to the well-being of the body, according to <a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse11">Proverbs 24:11</a>, "Deliver them that are led to death": secondarily as regards avoiding damage to one's property, according to <a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 22:1</a>, "Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother." Hence a corporal work pertaining to the preservation of one's own bodily well-being does not profane the Sabbath: for it is not against the observance of the Sabbath to eat and do such things as preserve the health of the body. For this reason the Machabees did not profane the Sabbath when they fought in self-defense on the Sabbath day (<a href="../bible/1ma002.htm">1 Maccabees 2</a>), nor Elias when he fled from the face of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> on the Sabbath. For this same reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse3">Matthew 12:3</a>) excused His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for plucking the ears of corn on account of the need which they suffered. On like manner a bodily work that is directed to the bodily well-being of another is not contrary to the observance of the Sabbath: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John 7:23</a>): "Are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at Me because I have healed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the Sabbath day?" And again, a bodily work that is done to avoid an imminent damage to some external thing does not profane the Sabbath, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse11">Matthew 12:11</a>): "What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall there be among you, that hath one sheep, and if the same fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not take hold on it and lift it up?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> the observance of the Lord's day took the place of the observance of the Sabbath, not by virtue of the precept but by the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the custom of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. For this observance is not figurative, as was the observance of the Sabbath in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Hence the prohibition to work on the Lord' day is not so strict as on the Sabbath: and certain works are permitted on the Lord's day which were forbidden on the Sabbath, such as the cooking of food and so forth. And again in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, dispensation is more easily granted than in the Old, in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of certain forbidden works, on account of their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, because the figure pertains to the protestation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which it is unlawful to omit even in small things; while works, considered in themselves, are changeable in point of place and time.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the fourth precept, about honoring one's parents, is fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the fourth precept, about honoring one's parents, is unfittingly expressed. For this is the precept pertaining to piety. Now, just as piety is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so are observance, gratitude, and others of which we have spoken (Q101,102, seq.). Therefore it seems that there should not have been given a special precept of piety, as none is given regarding the others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, piety pays worship not only to one's parents, but also to one's country, and also to other blood kindred, and to the well-wishers of our country, as stated above (101, 1 and 2). Therefore it was unfitting for this precept to mention only the honoring of one's father and mother.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we owe our parents not merely <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> but also support. Therefore the mere honoring of one's parents is unfittingly prescribed.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sometimes those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their parents die young, and on the contrary those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> them not live a long time. Therefore it was unfitting to supplement this precept with the promise, "That thou mayest be long-lived upon earth."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are directed to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Now to our parents, of all our neighbors, we are under the greatest <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Hence, immediately after the precepts directing us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a place is given to the precept directing us to our parents, who are the particular principle of our being, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the universal principle: so that this precept has a certain affinity to the precepts of the First Table.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 101, Article 2), piety directs us to pay the debt due to our parents, a debt which is common to all. Hence, since the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are general precepts, they ought to contain some reference to piety rather than to the other parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which regard some special debt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The debt to one's parents precedes the debt to one's kindred and country since it is because we are born of our parents that our kindred and country belong to us. Hence, since the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, they direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his parents rather than to his country and other kindred. Nevertheless this precept of honoring our parents is understood to command whatever concerns the payment of debt to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as secondary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> included in the principal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Reverential <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to one's parents as such, whereas support and so forth are due to them <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, for instance, because they are in want, in slavery, or the like, as stated above (Question 101, Article 2). And since that which belongs to a thing by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> precedes that which is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, it follows that among the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, which are the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, there is a special precept of honoring our parents: and this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as a kind of principle, is understood to comprise support and whatever else is due to our parents.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A long life is promised to those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their parents not only as to the life to come, but also as to the present life, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>): "Piety [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>'] is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come." And with reason. Because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is grateful for a favor deserves, with a certain congruity, that the favor should be continued to him, and he who is ungrateful for a favor deserves to lose it. Now we owe the favor of bodily life to our parents after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore he that honors his parents deserves the prolongation of his life, because he is grateful for that favor: while he that honors not his parents deserves to be deprived of life because he is ungrateful for the favor. However, present goods or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are not the subject of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit except in so far as they are directed to a future reward, as stated above (I-II, 114, 12). Wherefore sometimes in accordance with the hidden design of the Divine judgments, which regard chiefly the future reward, some, who are dutiful to their parents, are sooner deprived of life, while others, who are undutiful to their parents, live longer.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the other six precepts of the decalogue are fittingly expressed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the other six precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are unfittingly expressed. For it is not sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that one refrain from injuring one's neighbor; but it is required that one pay one's debts, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse7">Romans 13:7</a>, "Render . . . to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> their dues." Now the last six precepts merely forbid one to injure one's neighbor. Therefore these precepts are unfittingly expressed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, these precepts forbid <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, stealing and bearing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness. But many other injuries can be inflicted on one's neighbor, as appears from those which have been specified above (Q72, seq.). Therefore it seems that the aforesaid precepts are unfittingly expressed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> may be taken in two ways. First as denoting an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as in <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse21">Wisdom 6:21</a>, "The desire [concupiscentia] of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom": secondly, as denoting an act of the sensuality, as in <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse1">James 4:1</a>, "From whence are <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and contentions among you? Are they not . . . from your <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in your members?" Now the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the sensuality is not forbidden by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, otherwise first movements would be mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as they would be against a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> forbidden, since it is included in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it is unfitting for the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> to include some that forbid <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. But there is no precept forbidding the desire of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Therefore neither was it fitting to have precepts forbidding the desire of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as by the parts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a man pays that which is due to certain definite <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to whom he is bound for some special reason, so too by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> properly so called he pays that which is due to all in general. Hence, after the three precepts pertaining to religion, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pays what is due <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after the fourth precept pertaining to piety, whereby he pays what is due to his parents--which <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> includes the paying of all that is due for any special reason--it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in due sequence to give certain precepts pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> properly so called, which pays to all indifferently what is due to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is bound towards all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in general to inflict injury on no one: hence the negative precepts, which forbid the doing of those injuries that can be inflicted on one's neighbor, had to be given a place, as general precepts, among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. On the other hand, the duties we owe to our neighbor are paid in different ways to different people: hence it did not behoove to include affirmative precepts about those duties among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All other injuries that are inflicted on our neighbor are reducible to those that are forbidden by these precepts, as taking precedence of others in point of generality and importance. For all injuries that are inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of our neighbor are understood to be forbidden under the head of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> as being the principal of all. Those that are inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> connected with one's neighbor, especially by way of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, are understood to be forbidden together with <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: those that come under the head of damage done to property are understood to be forbidden together with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: and those that are comprised under speech, such as detractions, insults, and so forth, are understood to be forbidden together with the bearing of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, which is more directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The precepts forbidding <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> do not include the prohibition of first movements of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, that do not go farther than the bounds of sensuality. The direct object of their prohibition is the consent of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is directed to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Murder in itself is an object not of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> but of horror, since it has not in itself the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> has the aspect of a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. of something pleasurable, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> has an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. of something useful: and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has the aspect of something <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> had to be forbidden by special precepts, but not the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.
