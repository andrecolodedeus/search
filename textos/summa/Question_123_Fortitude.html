<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fortitude is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>): "Virtue is perfected in infirmity." But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is contrary to infirmity. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is either theological, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, or moral. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not contained among the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, nor among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as may be gathered from what we have said above (I-II, 57, 2; I-II, 62, 3). Neither, apparently, is it contained among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 7,8): "Some seem to be brave through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; or through experience, as soldiers," both of which cases seem to pertain to act rather than to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, "and some are called brave on account of certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>"; for instance, on account of fear of threats, or of dishonor, or again on account of sorrow, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or hope. But moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not act from passion but from choice, as stated above (I-II, 55, 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> resides chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since it is a "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," as stated above (Ethic. iii, 7,8). But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, seemingly, resides in the body, or at least results from the temperament of the body. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Morib. Eccl. xv, xxi, xxii) numbers <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6) "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and renders his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, of which we are speaking now, is that which makes a man <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and tenders his work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be in accordance with reason, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv, 22). Wherefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to make his work accord with reason. This happens in three ways: first, by rectifying reason itself, and this is done by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; secondly, by establishing the rectitude of reason in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, and this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; thirdly, by removing the obstacles to the establishment of this rectitude in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is hindered in two ways from following the rectitude of reason. First, through being drawn by some object of pleasure to something other than what the rectitude of reason requires; and this obstacle is removed by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Secondly, through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being disinclined to follow that which is in accordance with reason, on account of some difficulty that presents itself. On order to remove this obstacle <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is requisite, whereby to resist the aforesaid difficulty even as a man, by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of body, overcomes and removes bodily obstacles.

<p>Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it conforms <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is perfected, not in the infirmity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in the infirmity of the body, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was speaking. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to bear bravely with infirmities of the flesh, and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience or <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as also to acknowledge one's own infirmity, and this belongs to the perfection that is called <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> performs the exterior act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without having the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and from some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 8) mentions five ways in which people are said to be brave by way of resemblance, through performing acts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> without having the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. This may be done in three ways. First, because they tend to that which is difficult as though it were not difficult: and this again happens in three ways, for sometimes this is owing to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, through not perceiving the greatness of the danger; sometimes it is owing to the fact that one is hopeful of overcoming dangers--when, for instance, one has often experienced escape from danger; and sometimes this is owing to a certain science and art, as in the case of soldiers who, through skill and practice in the use of arms, think little of the dangers of battle, as they reckon themselves capable of defending themselves against them; thus Vegetius says (De Re Milit. i), "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to do what he is confident of having learned to do well." Secondly, a man performs an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> without having the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through the impulse of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, whether of sorrow that he wishes to cast off, or again of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Thirdly, through choice, not indeed of a due end, but of some temporal advantage to be obtained, such as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, pleasure, or gain, or of some disadvantage to be avoided, such as blame, pain, or loss.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as explained in the Reply to the First Objection, is so called from its likeness to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the body. Nor is it inconsistent with the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that a man should have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by reason of his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> temperament, as stated above (I-II, 63, 1).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fortitude is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>): "She teacheth <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>," where the text has "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" for "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>." Since then the term "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" is common to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "Fortitude is not lacking in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, for alone she defends the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and guards their behests. She it is that wages an inexorable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, undeterred by toil, brave in face of dangers, steeled against pleasures, unyielding to lusts, avoiding <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as a deformity that weakens <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>"; and he says the same further on in connection with other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Now this cannot apply to any special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> would seem to derive its name from firmness. But it belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to stand firm, as stated in Ethic. ii. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxii) numbers it among the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 61, 3,4), the term "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>" can be taken in two ways. First, as simply denoting a certain firmness of mind, and in this sense it is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or rather a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii), it is requisite for every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to act firmly and immovably. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> may be taken to denote firmness only in bearing and withstanding those things wherein it is most difficult to be firm, namely in certain grave dangers. Therefore Tully says (Rhet. ii), that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is deliberate facing of dangers and bearing of toils." On this sense <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is reckoned a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it has a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Coelo i, 116) the word <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> refers to the extreme limit of a power. Now a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power is, in one sense, the power of resisting corruptions, and in another sense is a principle of action, as stated in Metaph. v, 17. And since this latter meaning is the more common, the term "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as denoting the extreme limit of such a power, is a common term, for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> taken in a general sense is nothing else than a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby one acts well. But as denoting the extreme limit of power in the first sense, which sense is more specific, it is applied to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to which it belongs to stand firm against all kinds of assaults.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> takes <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in a broad sense, as denoting firmness of mind in face of assaults of all kinds. Nevertheless even as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it helps to resist the assaults of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For he that can stand firm in things that are most difficult to bear, is prepared, in consequence, to resist those which are less difficult.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection takes <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in the first sense.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fortitude is about fear and daring?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not about fear and daring. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. vii): "The <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to overcome the flesh, to withstand self-indulgence, to quench the lusts of the present life." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> seems to be about pleasures rather than about fear and daring.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to face dangers and to bear toil. But this seemingly has nothing to do with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of fear and daring, but rather with a man's toilsome <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and external dangers. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not about fear and daring.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, not only daring, but also hope, is opposed to fear, as stated above (I-II, 45, 1, ad 2) in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> should not be about daring any more than about hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 9) that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to remove any obstacle that withdraws the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from following the reason. Now to be withdrawn from something difficult belongs to the notion of fear, which denotes withdrawal from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that entails difficulty, as stated above (I-II, 42, 3,5) in the treatise on <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly about fear of difficult things, which can withdraw the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from following the reason. And it behooves one not only firmly to bear the assault of these difficulties by restraining fear, but also moderately to withstand them, when, to wit, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to dispel them altogether in order to free oneself therefrom for the future, which seems to come under the notion of daring. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring, as curbing fear and moderating daring.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is speaking then of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as to its common relation to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence he first of all mentions matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as in the words quoted, and then adds that which pertains properly to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by saying: "To love the trials of this life for the sake of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Dangers and toils do not withdraw the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> from the course of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, except in so far as they are an object of fear. Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> needs to be immediately about fear and daring, but mediately about dangers and toils, these being the objects of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope is opposed to fear on the part of the object, for hope is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, fear of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: whereas daring is about the same object, and is opposed to fear by way of approach and withdrawal, as stated above (I-II, 45, 1). And since <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> properly regards those temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that withdraw one from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as appears from Tully's definition quoted in the Second Objection, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> properly is about fear and daring and not about hope, except in so far as it is connected with daring, as stated above (I-II, 45, 2).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether fortitude is only about dangers of death?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not only about dangers of death. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is love bearing all things readily for the sake of the object beloved": and (Music. vi) he says that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is "the love which dreads no hardship, not even death." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not only about danger of death, but also about other afflictions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> need to be reduced to a mean by some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now there is no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> reducing <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to a mean. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not only about fear of death, but also about other <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about extremes. But fear of death is about an extreme, since it is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>, as stated in Ethic. iii. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not about fear of death.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Andronicus says that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the irascible faculty that is not easily deterred by the fear of death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to guard the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> against being withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason through fear of bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now it behooves one to hold firmly the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whatsoever, since no bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be that which binds the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> firmly to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason in face of the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: because he that stands firm against great things, will in consequence stand firm against less things, but not conversely. Moreover it belongs to the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that it should regard something extreme: and the most fearful of all bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> is death, since it does away all bodily goods. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xxii) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is shaken by its fellow body, with fear of toil and pain, lest the body be stricken and harassed with fear of death lest it be done away and destroyed." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about the fear of dangers of death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fortitude behaves well in bearing all manner of adversity: yet a man is not reckoned brave simply through bearing any kind of adversity, but only through bearing well even the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; while through bearing others he is said to be brave in a restricted sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since fear is born of love, any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that moderates the love of certain goods must in consequence moderate the fear of contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: thus liberality, which moderates the love of money, as a consequence, moderates the fear of losing it, and the same is the case with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But to love one's own life is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>: and hence the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> modifying the fear of death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> the extreme consists in exceeding right reason: wherefore to undergo the greatest dangers in accordance with reason is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether fortitude is properly about dangers of death in battle?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not properly about dangers of death in battle. For <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> above all are commended for their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are not commended in connection with battle. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not properly about dangers of death in battle.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is applicable both to warlike and to civil matters": and Tully (De Offic. i), under the heading, "That it pertains to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to excel in battle rather than in civil life," says: "Although not a few think that the business of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is of greater importance than the affairs of civil life, this opinion must be qualified: and if we wish to judge the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, there are many things in civil life that are more important and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than those connected with <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>." Now greater <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about greater things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not properly concerned with death in battle.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is directed to the preservation of a country's temporal peace: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xix) that "<a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> are waged in order to insure peace." Now it does not seem that one ought to expose oneself to the danger of death for the temporal peace of one's country, since this same peace is the occasion of much license in morals. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not about the danger of death in battle.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii) that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly about death in battle.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> strengthens a man's mind against the greatest danger, which is that of death. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> ever to tend to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; wherefore it is in order to pursue some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not fly from the danger of death. But the dangers of death arising out of sickness, storms at sea, attacks from robbers, and the like, do not seem to come on a man through his pursuing some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. on the other hand, the dangers of death which occur in battle come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> directly on account of some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because, to wit, he is defending the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by a just fight. Now a just fight is of two kinds. First, there is the general combat, for instance, of those who fight in battle; secondly, there is the private combat, as when a judge or even private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> does not refrain from giving a just judgment through fear of the impending sword, or any other danger though it threaten death. Hence it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> against dangers of death, not only such as arise in a general battle, but also such as occur in singular combat, which may be called by the general name of battle. Accordingly it must be granted that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is properly about dangers of death occurring in battle.

<p>Moreover, a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> behaves well in face of danger of any other kind of death; especially since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be in danger of any kind of death on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus may a man not fail to attend on a sick friend through fear of deadly infection, or not refuse to undertake a journey with some godly object in view through fear of shipwreck or robbers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Martyrs face the fight that is waged against their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and this for the sake of the sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is praised above all. Nor is it outside the genus of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that regards warlike actions, for which reason they are said to have been valiant in battle. [Office of Martyrs, ex. Heb. xi. 34.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Personal and civil business is differentiated from the business of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that regards general wars. However, personal and civil affairs admit of dangers of death arising out of certain conflicts which are private <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and so with regard to these also there may be <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> properly so called.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The peace of the state is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, nor does it become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of it. For there are many others who make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of it; and many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> prevented by it, such as murders and sacrileges, are much greater than those which are occasioned by it, and which belong chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether endurance is the chief act of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that endurance is not the chief act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 3). Now it is more difficult to attack than to endure. Therefore endurance is not the chief act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be able to act on another seems to argue greater power than not to be changed by another. Now to attack is to act on another, and to endure is to persevere unchangeably. Since then <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> denotes perfection of power, it seems that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to attack rather than to endure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one contrary is more distant from the other than its mere negation. Now to endure is merely not to fear, whereas to attack denotes a movement contrary to that of fear, since it implies pursuit. Since then <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> above all withdraws the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from fear, it seems that it regards attack rather than endurance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 9) that "certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are" said to be brave chiefly because they endure affliction.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), and according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 9), "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is more concerned to allay fear, than to moderate daring." For it is more difficult to allay fear than to moderate daring, since the danger which is the object of daring and fear, tends by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to check daring, but to increase fear. Now to attack belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in so far as the latter moderates daring, whereas to endure follows the repression of fear. Therefore the principal act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is endurance, that is to stand immovable in the midst of dangers rather than to attack them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Endurance is more difficult than aggression, for three reasons. First, because endurance seemingly implies that one is being attacked by a stronger <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whereas aggression denotes that one is attacking as though one were the stronger party; and it is more difficult to contend with a stronger than with a weaker. Secondly, because he that endures already feels the presence of danger, whereas the aggressor looks upon danger as something to come; and it is more difficult to be unmoved by the present than by the future. Thirdly, because endurance implies length of time, whereas aggression is consistent with sudden movements; and it is more difficult to remain unmoved for a long time, than to be moved suddenly to something arduous. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "some hurry to meet danger, yet fly when the danger is present; this is not the behavior of a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Endurance denotes indeed a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the body, but an action of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cleaving most resolutely [fortissime] to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the result being that it does not yield to the threatening passion of the body. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> concerns the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that endures <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> not, though he is confronted with the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fear, whereas this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not present to the aggressor.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the brave man acts for the sake of the good of his habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not act for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For in matters of action the end, though first in <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, is last in execution. Now the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in the order of execution, follows the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore it is impossible for the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiii): "We love <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and yet some make bold to counsel us to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>," namely by saying that we should desire <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for its own sake, "without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. If they succeed in their endeavor, we shall surely cease to love <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, since we shall no longer love that for the sake of which alone we love <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is directed not to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is love ready to bear all things for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but something better, since the end must needs be better than what is directed to the end. Therefore the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not act for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7) that "to the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> itself is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": and such is his end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An end is twofold: proximate and ultimate. Now the proximate end of every agent is to introduce a likeness of that agent's form into something else: thus the end of fire in heating is to introduce the likeness of its heat into some passive <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the end of the builder is to introduce into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the likeness of his art. Whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ensues from this, if it be intended, may be called the remote end of the agent. Now just as in things made, external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is fashioned by art, so in things done, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are fashioned by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Accordingly we must conclude that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends as his proximate end to reproduce in action a likeness of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, for he intends to act in accordance with his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: but his remote end is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the First Objection proceeds as though the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> were its end, instead of the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in act, as stated. The other two objections consider the ultimate end.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the brave man delights in his act?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> delights in his act. For "delight is the unhindered action of a connatural <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>" (Ethic. x, 4,6,8). Now the brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which acts after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes pleasure in his act.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, commenting on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22</a>, "But the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace," says that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are called "fruits because they refresh <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and pure delight." Now the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> performs acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore he takes pleasure in his act.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger. Now the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a stronger love for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than for his own body, which he exposes to the danger of death. Therefore the delight in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> banishes the pain of the body; and consequently the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does all things with pleasure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 9) that "the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seems to have no delight in his act."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 31, 3,4,5) where we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, pleasure is twofold; one is bodily, resulting from bodily contact, the other is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, resulting from an apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It is the latter which properly results from <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since in them we consider the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Now the principal act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is to endure, not only certain things that are unpleasant as apprehended by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--for instance, the loss of bodily life, which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves not only as a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and things connected with them--but also to endure things unpleasant in respect of bodily contact, such as wounds and blows. Hence the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on one side, has something that affords him delight, namely as regards <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure, in the act itself of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the end thereof: while, on the other hand, he has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sorrow, in the thought of losing his life, and for bodily pain. Hence we read (<a href="../bible/2ma006.htm#verse30">2 Maccabees 6:30</a>) that Eleazar said: "I suffer grievous pains in body: but in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> am well content to suffer these things because I fear Thee."

<p>Now the sensible pain of the body makes one insensible to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> delight of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, without the copious assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which has more strength to raise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the Divine things in which it delights, than bodily pains have to afflict it. Thus the Blessed Tiburtius, while walking barefoot on the burning coal, said that he felt as though he were walking on roses.

<p>Yet the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> prevents the reason from being entirely overcome by bodily pain. And the delight of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> overcomes <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sorrow, inasmuch as a man prefers the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the life of the body and to whatever appertains thereto. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3; iii, 9) that "it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to delight so as to perceive his delight, but it suffices for him not to be sad."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The vehemence of the action or passion of one power hinders the action of another power: wherefore the pain in his senses hinders the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from feeling delight in its proper operation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">Deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are delightful chiefly on account of their end; yet they can be painful by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is principally the case with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 9) that "to perform <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> with pleasure does not happen in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, except in so far as one attains the end."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> sorrow is overcome by the delight of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet since bodily pain is more sensible, and the sensitive apprehension is more in evidence to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure in the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> fades away, so to speak, in the presence of great bodily pain.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether fortitude deals chiefly with sudden occurrences?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> does not deal chiefly with sudden occurrences. For it would seem that things occur suddenly when they are unforeseen. But Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is the deliberate facing of danger, and bearing of toil." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> does not deal chiefly with sudden happenings.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "The brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not unmindful of what may be likely to happen; he takes measures beforehand, and looks out as from the conning-tower of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so as to encounter the future by his forethought, lest he should say afterwards: This befell me because I did not think it could possibly happen." But it is not possible to be prepared for the future in the case of sudden occurrences. Therefore the operation of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not concerned with sudden happenings.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that the "brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hope." But hope looks forward to the future, which is inconsistent with sudden occurrences. Therefore the operation of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not concerned with sudden happenings.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly about sudden dangers of death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things must be considered in the operation of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. One is in regard to its choice: and thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not about sudden occurrences: because the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chooses to think beforehand of the dangers that may arise, in order to be able to withstand them, or to bear them more easily: since according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxv in Evang.), "the blow that is foreseen strikes with less force, and we are able more easily to bear earthly wrongs, if we are forearmed with the shield of foreknowledge." The other thing to be considered in the operation of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards the display of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>: and in this way <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly about sudden occurrences, because according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 8) the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is displayed chiefly in sudden dangers: since a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> works by way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> without forethought does that which pertains to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> urges on account of some sudden danger, this is a very strong <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is firmly seated in his mind.

<p>Yet is it possible for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> even without the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to prepare his mind against danger by long forethought: in the same way as a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prepares himself when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether the brave man makes use of anger in his action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not use <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in his action. For no one should employ as an instrument of his action that which he cannot use at will. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot use <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at will, so as to take it up and lay it aside when he will. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Memoria ii), when a bodily passion is in movement, it does not rest at once just as one wishes. Therefore a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not employ <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> for his action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a man is competent to do a thing by himself, he should not seek the assistance of something weaker and more imperfect. Now the reason is competent to achieve by itself <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is impotent: wherefore Seneca says (De Ira i): "<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> by itself suffices not only to make us prepared for action but also to accomplish it. On fact is there greater folly than for reason to seek help from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? the steadfast from the unstaid, the trusty from the untrustworthy, the healthy from the sick?" Therefore a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not make use of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as people are more earnest in doing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so are they on account of sorrow or desire; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that wild beasts are incited to face danger through sorrow or pain, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> dare many things for the sake of desire. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> employs neither sorrow nor desire for its action. Therefore in like manner it should not employ <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> helps the brave."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 24, 2), concerning <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> there was a difference of opinion between the Peripatetics and the Stoics. For the Stoics excluded <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and all other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a wise or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: whereas the Peripatetics, of whom <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was the chief, ascribed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men both <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> albeit modified by reason. And possibly they differed not in reality but in their way of speaking. For the Peripatetics, as stated above (I-II, 24, 2), gave the name of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to all the movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, however they may comport themselves. And since the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved by the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, so that it may cooperate by rendering action more prompt, they held that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should employ both <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, modified according to the dictate of reason. On the other hand, the Stoics gave the name of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to certain immoderate emotions of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, wherefore they called them sicknesses or diseases, and for this reason severed them altogether from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Accordingly the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> employs moderate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> for his action, but not immoderate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Anger that is moderated in accordance with reason is subject to the command of reason: so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> uses it at his will, which would not be the case were it immoderate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> employs <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> for its action, not as seeking its assistance, but because it uses the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> as an instrument, just as it uses the members of the body. Nor is it unbecoming for the instrument to be more imperfect than the principal agent, even as the hammer is more imperfect than the smith. Moreover, Seneca was a follower of the Stoics, and the above words were aimed by him directly at <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whereas <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), has two acts, namely endurance and aggression, it employs <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, not for the act of endurance, because the reason by itself performs this act, but for the act of aggression, for which it employs <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, since it belongs to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to strike at the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sorrow, so that it directly cooperates with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in attacking. On the other hand, sorrow by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> gives way to the thing that hurts; though <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it helps in aggression, either as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as stated above (I-II, 47, 3), or as making a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> expose himself to danger in order to escape from sorrow. On like manner desire, by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, tends to a pleasurable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which it is directly contrary to withstand danger: yet <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> sometimes it helps one to attack, in so far as one prefers to risk dangers rather than lack pleasure. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 5): "Of all the cases in which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> arises from a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> is when a man is brave through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, making his choice and acting for a purpose," i.e. for a due end; "this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>."

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether fortitude is a cardinal virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For, as stated above (<a href="../summa/3123.htm#article10">Question 123, Article 10</a>), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is closely allied with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not accounted a principal passion; nor is daring which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> be reckoned a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But the direct object of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for it is endurance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and toil, as Tully says (<em>De Inv. Rhet.</em> ii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about those things upon which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is chiefly occupied, just as a door turns upon a hinge (<em>cardine</em>). But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about dangers of death which are of rare occurrence in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> should not be reckoned a cardinal or principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (<em><a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a>.</em> xxii), <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> in his commentary on <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke 6:20</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (<em>De Moribus Eccl.</em> xv), number <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> among the four cardinal or principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="../summa/2061.htm#article3">Prima Secundae Partis, Question 61, Article 3</a> and <a href="../summa/2061.htm#article4">Article 4</a>), those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are said to be cardinal or principal which have a foremost claim to that which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in common. And among other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general is one that is stated to "act steadfastly", according to <em>Ethic.</em> ii, 4. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> above all lays claim to praise for steadfastness. Because he that stands firm is so much the more praised, as he is more strongly impelled to fall or recede. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is impelled to reced from that which is in accordance with reason, both by the pleasing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the displeasing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But bodily pain impels him more strongly than pleasure. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. 83, qu. 36): "There is none that does not shun pain more than he desires pleasure. For we perceive that even the most untamed beasts are deterred from the greatest pleasures by the fear of pain." And among the pains of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and dangers those are mostly feared which lead to death, and it is against them that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands firm. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Daring and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> do not cooperate with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in its act of endurance, wherein its steadfastness is chiefly commended: for it is by that act that the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> curbs fear, which is a principal passion, as stated above (<a href="../summa/2025.htm#article4">Prima Secundae Pars, Question 25, Article 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtue is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason which it behooves to safeguard against the onslaught of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body, as contraries which it withstands, and to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as the end, which it intends to safeguard.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Though dangers of death are of rare occurrence, yet the occasions of those dangers occur frequently, since on account of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which he pursues, and also on account of other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> encounters mortal adversaries.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether fortitude excels among all other virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> excels among all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i): "Fortitude is higher, so to speak, than the rest."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about that which is difficult and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about most difficult things. Therefore it is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of a man is more excellent than his possessions. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about a man's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, for it is this that a man exposes to the danger of death for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are about other and external things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is the chief of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Offic. i): "Justice is the most resplendent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and gives its name to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 19): "Those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs be greatest which are most profitable to others." Now liberality seems to be more useful than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore it is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi), "In things that are great, but not in bulk, to be great is to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>": wherefore the better a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the greater it is. Now reason's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since it is a perfection of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>: while <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> effects this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to establish the order of reason in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs: whereas the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> safeguard this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as they moderate the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, lest they lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from reason's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. As to the order of the latter, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> holds the first place, because fear of dangers of death has the greatest power to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> recede from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason: and after <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> comes <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, since also pleasures of touch excel all others in hindering the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Now to be a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> ranks before effecting it, and the latter ranks before safeguarding it by removing obstacles thereto. Wherefore among the cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> ranks first, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> second, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> third, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> fourth, and after these the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> places <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> before the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in respect of a certain general utility, inasmuch as it is useful both in warfare, and in matters relating to civil or home life. Hence he begins by saying (De Offic. i): "Now we come to treat of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which being higher so to speak than the others, is applicable both to warlike and to civil matters."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtue <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than the difficult. Hence the greatness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is measured according to its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> rather than its difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not expose his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to dangers of death except in order to safeguard <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: wherefore the praise awarded to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> depends somewhat on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is an occasion of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; since the stronger a man is the more ready is he to oppress the weaker."

<p>The Fourth argument is granted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Liberality is useful in conferring certain particular favors: whereas a certain general utility attaches to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, since it safeguards the whole order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 9) that "just and brave men are most beloved, because they are most useful in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and peace."
