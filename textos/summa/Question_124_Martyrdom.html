<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether martyrdom is an act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For all acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is sometimes not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a> who were slain for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and of whom Hillary says (Super Matth. i) that "they attained the ripe age of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing unlawful is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is unlawful to kill oneself, as stated above (Question 64, Article 5), and yet <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is achieved by so doing: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i) that "during <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in order to escape from those who threatened their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, threw themselves into a river, and so ended their lives, and their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church with most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> veneration." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is praiseworthy to offer oneself to do an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it is not praiseworthy to court <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, rather would it seem to be presumptuous and rash. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The reward of beatitude is not due save to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, since it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew 5:10</a>): "Blessed are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>' sake, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (123, 1 and 3), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to safeguard <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason consists in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as its proper object, and in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as its proper effect, as shown above (109, 1 and 2; 123, 12). And <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in standing firmly to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> against the assaults of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some have said that in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a> the use of their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> accelerated, so that they suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> even <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> contains no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, it is better to say that these babes in being slain obtained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> which others acquire by their own will. For the shedding of one's blood for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake takes the place of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. Wherefore just as in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is conducive to the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through the baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so in those who were slain for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is conducive to the acquisition of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> palm. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on the Epiphany (De Diversis lxvi), as though he were addressing them: "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that children are benefited by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of your being crowned in suffering for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. You were not old enough to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> future sufferings, but you had a body wherein you could endure suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who was to suffer."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i) that "possibly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was induced by certain credible <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of Divine authority thus to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> [Cf. 64, 1, ad 2]."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are about acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it has been stated (I-II, 108, 1, ad 4) that some of the precepts of the Divine Law are to be understood in reference to the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in the sense that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to be prepared to do such and such a thing, whenever expedient. On the same way certain things belong to an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as regards the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that in such and such a case a man should act according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And this observation would seem very much to the point in the case of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which consists in the right endurance of sufferings <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> inflicted. Nor ought a man to give another an occasion of acting <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: yet if anyone act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, one ought to endure it in moderation.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether martyrdom is an act of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For the Greek <em><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a></em> signifies a witness. Now witness is borne to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. according to <a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse8">Acts 1:8</a>, "You shall be <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> unto Me," etc. and Maximus says in a sermon: "The mother of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which those <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> warriors have sealed with their blood." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a praiseworthy act belongs chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which inclines thereto, is manifested thereby, and without which the act avails nothing. Now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is the chief incentive to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: Thus Maximus says in a sermon: "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is victorious in His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>." Again the greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> lies in the act of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>, "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Moreover without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> avails nothing, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>, "If I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>: "It is easy to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by singing his praises, but it is a great thing to imitate his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patience." Now that which calls chiefly for praise in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of which it is the act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of patience rather than of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (Ep. ad Mart. et Conf. ii): "Blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, with what praise shall I extol you? Most valiant warriors, how shall I find words to proclaim the strength of your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>?" Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is praised on account of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whose act he performs. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (123, 1, seqq.), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to strengthen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, especially against dangers, and chiefly against dangers of death, and most of all against those that occur in battle. Now it is evident that in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is firmly strengthened in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since he cleaves to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> notwithstanding the threatening danger of death, the imminence of which is moreover due to a kind of particular contest with his persecutors. Hence <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says in a sermon (Ep. ad Mart. et Conf. ii): "The crowd of onlookers wondered to see an unearthly battle, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> servants fighting erect, undaunted in speech, with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> unmoved, and strength divine." Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; for which reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reads in the office of Martyrs: They "became valiant in battle" [<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse34">Hebrews 11:34</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Two things must be considered in the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. one is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wherein the brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is strengthened, and this is the end of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; the other is the firmness itself, whereby a man does not yield to the contraries that hinder him from achieving that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in this consists the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now just as civic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> strengthens a man's mind in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for the safeguarding of which he braves the danger of death, so gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> strengthens <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is "through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," according to <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is related to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the end in which one is strengthened, but to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as the eliciting <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> inclines one to the act of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as its first and chief motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, being the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commanding it, whereas <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> inclines thereto as being its proper motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, being the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that elicits it. Hence <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as commanding, and of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as eliciting. For this reason also it manifests both <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. It is due to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, like any other act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and for this reason it avails not without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 123, Article 6), the chief act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is endurance: to this and not to its secondary act, which is aggression, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> belongs. And since patience serves <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> on the part of its chief act, viz. endurance, hence it is that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are also praised for their patience.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether martyrdom is an act of the greatest perfection?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of the greatest perfection. For seemingly that which is a matter of counsel and not of precept pertains to perfection, because, to wit, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But it would seem that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans 10:10</a>), "With the heart we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," and it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1 John 3:16</a>), that "we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> does not pertain to perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it seems to point to greater perfection that a man give his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is done by obedience, than that he give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his body, which is done by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience is preferable to all <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not an act of the greatest perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it would seem better to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to others than to maintain oneself in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since the "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the nation is better than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 2). Now he that suffers <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> profits himself alone, whereas he that teaches does <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to many. Therefore the act of teaching and guiding subjects is more perfect than the act of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Sanct. Virgin. xlvi) prefers <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which pertains to perfection. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> seems to belong to perfection in the highest degree.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may speak of an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. First, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that act, as compared to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> proximately eliciting it. On this way <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which consists in the due endurance of death, cannot be the most perfect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts, because endurance of death is not praiseworthy in itself, but only in so far as it is directed to some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consisting in an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that this act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being the end is better.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act may be considered in another way, in comparison with its first motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is the love of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and it is in this respect that an act comes to belong to the perfection of life, since, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>), that "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> . . . is the bond of perfection." Now, of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: since a man's love for a thing is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so much the greater, according as that which he despises for its sake is more dear to him, or that which he chooses to suffer for its sake is more odious. But it is evident that of all the goods of the present life <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves life itself most, and on the other hand he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> death more than anything, especially when it is accompanied by the pains of bodily torment, "from fear of which even dumb animals refrain from the greatest pleasures," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Q83, qu. 36). And from this point of view it is clear that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is the most perfect of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> in respect of its genus, as being the sign of the greatest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a>: "Greater love than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There is no act of perfection, which is a matter of counsel, but what in certain cases is a matter of precept, as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Adult. Conjug. xiii) that a man is under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, through the absence or sickness of his wife. Hence it is not contrary to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> if in certain cases it be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since there are cases when it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; thus we read of many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who through zeal for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or brotherly love gave themselves up to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of their own accord. As to these precepts, they are to be understood as referring to the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Martyrdom embraces the highest possible degree of obedience, namely obedience unto death; thus we read of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a>) that He became "obedient unto death." Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is of itself more perfect than obedience considered absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> according to the proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of its act, whence it derives no excellence over all other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts; thus neither is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> more excellent than all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether death is essential to martyrdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that death is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Assumption</a> (Epist. ad Paul. et Eustoch.): "I should say rightly that the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was both <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, although she ended her days in peace": and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. iii in Evang.): "Although <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has ceased to offer the opportunity, yet the peace we enjoy is not without its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, since even if we no longer yield the life of the body to the sword, yet do we slay fleshly desires in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the sword of the spirit." Therefore there can be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> without suffering death.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we read of certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as commended for despising life for the sake of safeguarding the integrity of the flesh: wherefore seemingly the integrity of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is preferable to the life of the body. Now sometimes the integrity of the flesh has been forfeited or has been threatened in confession of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/01214a.htm">Agnes</a> and <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Lucy</a>. Therefore it seems that the name of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> should be accorded to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who forfeits the integrity of the flesh for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rather than if she were to forfeit even the life of the body: wherefore also <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Lucy</a> said: "If thou <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causest</a> me to be violated against my will, my <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> will gain me a twofold crown."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to brave not only death but also other hardships, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Music. vi). Now there are many other hardships besides death, which one may suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely imprisonment, exile, being stripped of one's goods, as mentioned in <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse34">Hebrews 10:34</a>, for which reason we celebrate the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/09640b.htm">Pope Saint Marcellus</a>, notwithstanding that he died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> that one suffer the pain of death.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act, as stated above (2, ad 1; 3). Now it cannot be a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act after death. Therefore it is before death; and consequently death is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Maximus says in a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that "in dying for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he conquers who would have been vanquished in living without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is so called as being a witness to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which teaches us to despise things visible for the sake of things invisible, as stated in <a href="../bible/heb011.htm">Hebrews 11</a>. Accordingly it belongs to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> that a man bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in showing by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that he despises all things present, in order to obtain invisible goods to come. Now so long as a man retains the life of the body he does not show by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that he despises all things relating to the body. For men are wont to despise both their kindred and all they possess, and even to suffer bodily pain, rather than lose life. Hence Satan testified against <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> (<a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse4">Job 2:4</a>): "Skin for skin, and all that a man hath he will give for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'life'] i.e. for the life of his body. Therefore the perfect notion of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> requires that a man suffer death for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The authorities quoted, and the like that one may meet with, speak of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by way of similitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> forfeits the integrity of the flesh, or is condemned to forfeit it under pretext of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is not evident to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whether she suffers this for love of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or rather through contempt of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Wherefore in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> her testimony is not held to be sufficient, and consequently this is not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> properly speaking. On the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, Who searcheth the heart, this may be deemed worthy of a reward, as <a href="../cathen/09414a.htm">Lucy</a> said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (123, 4,5), <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards danger of death chiefly, and other dangers consequently; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not called a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> merely for suffering imprisonment, or exile, or forfeiture of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, except in so far as these result in death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is not after death, but in the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> endurance of death, namely in the fact that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> willingly suffers being put to death. It happens sometimes, however, that a man lives for some time after being mortally wounded for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, or after suffering for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> any other kind of hardship inflicted by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and continued until death ensues. The act of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> while a man is in this state, and at the very time that he is suffering these hardships.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether faith alone is the cause of martyrdom?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse15">1 Peter 4:15-16</a>): "Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, or a railer, or a coveter of other men's things. But if as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this name." Now a man is said to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> because he holds the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to those who suffer.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is a kind of witness. But witness is borne to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone. Now one is not called a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for bearing witness to any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but only for witnessing to the Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, otherwise a man would be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> if he were to die for confessing a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of geometry or some other speculative science, which seems ridiculous. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> would seem to be of most account which are directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the nation is better than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 2). If, then, some other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, it would seem that before all those would be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who die for the defense of their country. Yet this is not consistent with Church observance, for we do not celebrate the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of those who die in a just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew 5:10</a>): "Blessed are they that suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>' sake," which pertains to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome's</a> commentary on this passage. Now not only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but also the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are so called as being <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, because by suffering in body unto death they bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; not indeed to any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> includes not only inward <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but also outward profession, which is expressed not only by words, whereby one confesses the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whereby a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> shows that he has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse18">James 2:18</a>, "I will show thee, by works, my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Hence it is written of certain people (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus 1:16</a>): "They profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but in their works they deny Him." Thus all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, inasmuch as they are referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are professions of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires these works of us, and rewards us for them: and in this way they can be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Blessed John the Baptist</a>, who suffered death, not for refusing to deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but for reproving <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is one who is Christ's. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be Christ's, not only through having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also because he is actuated to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans 8:9</a>, "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His"; and again because in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> he is dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians 5:24</a>, "They that are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> have crucified their flesh with the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>." Hence to suffer as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is not only to suffer in confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is done by words, but also to suffer for doing any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, or for avoiding any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, because this all comes under the head of witnessing to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> has no connection with the worship of the Godhead: hence it is not called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>, and consequently the confession thereof cannot be said to be the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Yet, since every lie is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (110, 3,4), avoidance of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, to whatever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it may be contrary, may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> inasmuch as a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Divine Law.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of one's country is paramount among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> goods: yet the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is the proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, is of more account than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Nevertheless, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may become Divine, for instance when it is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in so far as it is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.
