<h1>Question 125. Fear</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3125.htm#article1"> Is fear a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3125.htm#article2"> Is it opposed to fortitude?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3125.htm#article3"> Is it a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3125.htm#article4"> Does it excuse from sin, or diminishes it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fear is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fear is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For fear is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, as stated above (I-II, 23, 4; 42). Now we are neither praised nor blamed for <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii. Since then every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is blameworthy, it seems that fear is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing that is commanded in the Divine Law is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: since the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Lord is unspotted" (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse8">Psalm 18:8</a>). Yet fear is commanded in <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians 6:5</a>): "Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling." Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nothing that is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii). Now fear is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7) that "a man would be insane or insensible to pain, if nothing, not even earthquakes nor deluges, inspired him with fear." Therefore fear is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>..

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>): "Fear ye not them that kill the body," and it is written (<a href="../bible/eze002.htm#verse6">Ezekiel 2:6</a>): "Fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of its being inordinate, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> consists in order, as stated above (109, 2; 114, 1). Now this due order requires that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be subject to the ruling of reason. And reason dictates that certain things should be shunned and some sought after. Among things to be shunned, it dictates that some are to be shunned more than others; and among things to be sought after, that some are to be sought after more than others. Moreover, the more a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be sought after, the more is the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be shunned. The result is that reason dictates that certain goods are to be sought after more than certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are to be avoided. Accordingly when the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> shuns what the reason dictates that we should endure rather than forfeit others that we should rather seek for, fear is inordinate and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. On the other hand, when the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> so as to shun what reason requires to be shunned, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is neither inordinate nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear in its generic acceptation denotes avoidance in general. Hence in this way it does not include the notion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and the same applies to every other passion. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> call for neither praise nor blame, because, to wit, we neither praise nor blame those who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> or afraid, but only those who behave thus in an ordinate or inordinate manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fear which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> inculcates is in accordance with reason, namely that servants should fear lest they be lacking in the service they owe their masters.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> dictates that we should shun the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that we cannot withstand, and the endurance of which profits us nothing. Hence there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in fearing them.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the sin of fear is contrary to fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fear is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about dangers of death, as stated above (123, A4,5). But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fear is not always connected with dangers of death, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa127.htm#verse1">Psalm 127:1</a>, "Blessed are all they that fear the Lord," says that "it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fear whereby we dread to suffer carnal dangers, or to lose worldly goods." Again a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse44">Matthew 27:44</a>, "He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the third time, saying the selfsame word," says that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fear is threefold, fear of death, fear of pain, and fear of contempt." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fear is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the chief reason why a man is commended for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is that he exposes himself to the danger of death. Now sometimes a man exposes himself to death through fear of slavery or shame. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> relates (De Civ. Dei i) that Cato, in order not to be Caesar's <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>, gave himself up to death. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fear bears a certain likeness to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> instead of being opposed thereto.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> arises from fear. But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is opposed not to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as stated above (20, 1; I-II, 40, 4). Neither therefore is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fear opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 7) states that timidity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (19, 3; I-II, 43, 1), all fear arises from love; since no one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> save what is contrary to something he loves. Now love is not confined to any particular kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: but ordinate love is included in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proper to his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; while inordinate love is included in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because inordinate love gives use to inordinate desire. Hence in like manner inordinate fear is included in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; thus the covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> the loss of money, the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the loss of pleasure, and so on. But the greatest fear of all is that which has the danger of death for its object, as we find <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Ethic. iii, 6. Wherefore the inordinateness of this fear is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which regards dangers of death. For this reason timidity is said to be antonomastically* opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. [Antonomasia is the figure of speech whereby we substitute the general for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> term; e.g. <em>The Philosopher</em> for <em><a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a></em>: and so timidity, which is inordinate fear of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is employed to denote inordinate fear of the danger of death.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passages quoted refer to inordinate fear in its generic acceptation, which can be opposed to various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> acts are estimated chiefly with reference to the end, as stated above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 6): and it belongs to a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to expose himself to danger of death for the sake of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But a man who exposes himself to danger of death in order to escape from slavery or hardships is overcome by fear, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7), that "to die in order to escape <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or something disagreeable is an act not of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but of cowardice: for to shun hardships is a mark of effeminacy."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 45, 2), fear is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> even as hope is the beginning of daring. Wherefore, just as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which employs daring in moderation presupposes hope, so on the other hand <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> proceeds from some kind of fear. It does not follow, however, that any kind of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> results from any kind of fear, but that only from fear of the same kind. Now the <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> that is opposed to hope is referred to another kind, namely to Divine things; whereas the fear that is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards dangers of death. Hence the argument does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fear is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fear is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, as stated above (I-II, 23, 1), fear is in the irascible faculty which is a part of the sensuality. Now there is none but venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality, as stated above (I-II, 74, 4). Therefore fear is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> turns the heart wholly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But fear does not this, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#verse3">Judges 7:3</a>, "Whosoever is fearful," etc., says that "a man is fearful when he trembles at the very thought of conflict; yet he is not so wholly terrified at heart, but that he can rally and take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>." Therefore fear is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a lapse not only from perfection but also from a precept. But fear does not make one lapse from a precept, but only from perfection; for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>, "What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there that is fearful and fainthearted?" says: "We learn from this that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can take up the profession of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> warfare, if he still <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to be despoiled of earthly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>." Therefore fear is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> For mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone is the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> due: and yet this is due to the fearful, according to <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse8">Apocalypse 21:8</a>, "But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable," etc., "shall have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone which is the second death." Therefore fear is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), fear is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through being inordinate, that is to say, through shunning what ought not to be shunned according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now sometimes this inordinateness of fear is confined to the sensitive appetites, without the accession of the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite's</a> consent: and then it cannot be a mortal, but only a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But sometimes this inordinateness of fear reaches to the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which deliberately shuns something against the dictate of reason: and this inordinateness of fear is sometimes a mortal, sometimes a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if a man through fear of the danger of death or of any other temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is so disposed as to do what is forbidden, or to omit what is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, such fear is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: otherwise it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers fear as confined to the sensuality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> also can be understood as referring to the fear that is confined within the sensuality. Or better still we may reply that a man is terrified with his whole heart when fear banishes his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> beyond remedy. Now even when fear is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it may happen nevertheless that one is not so wilfully terrified that one cannot be persuaded to put fear aside: thus sometimes a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally by consenting to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and is turned aside from accomplishing what he purposed doing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> speaks of the fear that turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> aside from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, not for the fulfilment of a precept, but for the perfection of a counsel. Such like fear is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is sometimes venial: and sometimes it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance when one has a reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for fear.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether fear excuses from sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fear does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For fear is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, rather does it aggravate it. Therefore fear does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if any fear excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, most of all would this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the fear of death, to which, as the saying is, a courageous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject. Yet this fear, seemingly, is no excuse, because, since death comes, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, to all, it does not seem to be an object of fear. Therefore fear does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all fear is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, either temporal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Now fear of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot excuse <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because instead of inducing one to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it withdraws one from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and fear of temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 6), "one should not fear <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, nor sickness, nor anything that is not a result of one's own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>." Therefore it seems that in no sense does fear excuse from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in the Decretals (I, 1, Cap. Constat.): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has been forcibly and unwillingly ordained by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, has an ostensible excuse."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), fear is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in so far as it runs counter to the order of reason. Now reason judges certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to be shunned rather than others. Wherefore it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to shun what is less to be shunned in order to avoid what reason judges to be more avoided: thus death of the body is more to be avoided than the loss of temporal goods. Hence a man would be excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if through fear of death he were to promise or give something to a robber, and yet he would be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were he to give to sinners, rather than to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to whom he should give in preference. On the other hand, if through fear a man were to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which according to reason are less to be avoided, and so incur <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which according to reason are more to be avoided, he could not be wholly excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because such like fear would be inordinate. Now the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are more to be feared than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body. and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body more than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of external things. Wherefore if one were to incur <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in order to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body, such as blows or death, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of external things, such as loss of money; or if one were to endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the body in order to avoid loss of money, one would not be wholly excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be extenuated somewhat, for what is done through fear is less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, because when fear lays hold of a man he is under a certain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of doing a certain thing. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 1) says that these things that are done through fear are not simply <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, but a mixture of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and involuntary.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fear excuses, not in the point of its sinfulness, but in the point of its involuntariness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although death comes, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, to all, yet the shortening of temporal life is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and consequently an object of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to the opinion of Stoics, who held temporal goods not to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> goods, it follows in consequence that temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and that therefore they are nowise to be feared. But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. ii) these temporal things are goods of the least account, and this was also the opinion of the Peripatetics. Hence their contraries are indeed to be feared; but not so much that one ought for their sake to renounce that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.
