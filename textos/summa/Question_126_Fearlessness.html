<h1>Question 126. Fearlessness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3126.htm#article1"> Is it a sin to be fearless?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3126.htm#article2"> Is it opposed to fortitude?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fearlessness is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fearlessness is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that which is reckoned to the praise of a just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is written in praise of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse1">Proverbs 28:1</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, bold as a lion, shall be without dread." Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be without fear.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing is so fearful as death, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 6). Yet one ought not to fear even death, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>, "Fear ye not them that kill the body," etc., nor anything that can be inflicted by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse12">Isaiah 51:12</a>, "Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>?" Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be fearless.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear is born of love, as stated above (Question 125, Article 2). Now it belongs to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to love nothing earthly, since according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv), "the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the abasement of self makes us citizens of the heavenly city." Therefore it is seemingly not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to fear nothing earthly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke 18:2</a>) that "he feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor regarded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since fear is born of love, we must seemingly judge alike of love and fear. Now it is here a question of that fear whereby one dreads temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and which results from the love of temporal goods. And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has it instilled in him by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to love his own life and whatever is directed thereto; and to do so in due measure, that is, to love these things not as placing his end therein, but as things to be used for the sake of his last end. Hence it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, and therefore a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to fall short of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> them in due measure. Nevertheless, one never lapses entirely from this love: since what is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> cannot be wholly lost: for which reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a>): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh." Wherefore even those that slay themselves do so from love of their own flesh, which they desire to free from present stress. Hence it may happen that a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> death and other temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> less than he ought, for the reason that he loves them* less than he ought. [Viz. the contrary goods. One would expect 'se' instead of 'ea.' We should then read: For the reason that he loves himself less than he ought.] But that he fear none of these things cannot result from an entire lack of love, but only from the fact that he thinks it impossible for him to be afflicted by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> contrary to the goods he loves. This is sometimes the result of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> presuming on self and despising others, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/job041.htm#verse24">Job 41:24-25</a>: "He [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'who'] was made to fear no one, he beholdeth every high thing": and sometimes it happens through a defect in the reason; thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7) that the "Celts, through lack of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, fear nothing." ["A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would deserve to be called insane and senseless if there were nothing that he feared, not even an earthquake nor a storm at sea, as is said to be the case with the Celts."] It is therefore evident that fearlessness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, whether it result from lack of love, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or dullness of understanding: yet the latter is excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if it be invincible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is praised for being without fear that withdraws him from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; not that he is altogether fearless, for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse28">Sirach 1:28</a>): "He that is without fear cannot be justified."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Death and whatever else can be inflicted by mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are not to be feared so that they make us forsake <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: but they are to be feared as hindering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, either as regards himself, or as regards the progress he may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in others. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse16">Proverbs 14:16</a>): "A wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> feareth and declineth from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Temporal goods are to be despised as hindering us from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> and serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on the same score they are not to be feared; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse16">Sirach 34:16</a>): "He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing." But temporal goods are not to be despised, in so far as they are helping us instrumentally to attain those things that pertain to Divine fear and love.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fearlessness is opposed to fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that fearlessness is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For we judge of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> by their acts. Now no act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is hindered by a man being fearless: since if fear be removed, one is both brave to endure, and daring to attack. Therefore fearlessness is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fearlessness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, either through lack of due love, or on account of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or by reason of folly. Now lack of due love is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and folly to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> or wisdom. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of fearlessness is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and extremes to the mean. But one mean has only one extreme on the one side. Since then <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> has fear opposed to it on the one side and daring on the other, it seems that fearlessness is not opposed thereto.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii) reckons fearlessness to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 123, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is concerned about fear and daring. Now every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the rational mean in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which it is concerned. Hence it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should moderate his fear according to reason, namely that he should fear what he ought, and when he ought, and so forth. Now this mode of reason may be corrupted either by excess or by deficiency. Wherefore just as timidity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> by excess of fear, in so far as a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> what he ought not, and as he ought not, so too fearlessness is opposed thereto by deficiency of fear, in so far as a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> not what he ought to fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is to endure death without fear, and to be aggressive, not anyhow, but according to reason: this the fearless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fearlessness by its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> corrupts the mean of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, wherefore it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> directly. But in respect of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> nothing hinders it from being opposed to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of daring is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> by excess of daring, and fearlessness by deficiency of fear. Fortitude imposes the mean on each passion. Hence there is nothing unreasonable in its having different extremes in different respects.
