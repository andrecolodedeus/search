<h1>Question 127. Daring</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3127.htm#article1"> Is daring a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3127.htm#article2"> Is it opposed to fortitude?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether daring is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that daring is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/job039.htm#verse21">Job 39:21</a>) concerning the horse, by which according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) the godly preacher is denoted, that "he goeth forth boldly to meet armed men [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'he pranceth boldly, he goeth forth to meet armed men']." But no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> redounds to a man's praise. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be daring.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 9), "one should take counsel in thought, and do quickly what has been counseled." But daring helps this quickness in doing. Therefore daring is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> but praiseworthy.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, daring is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by hope, as stated above (I-II, 45, 2) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But hope is accounted not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Neither therefore should daring be accounted a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir008.htm#verse18">Sirach 8:18</a>): "Go not on the way with a bold <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lest he burden thee with his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fellowship is to be avoided save on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore daring is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Daring, as stated above (I-II, 23, 1; 55), is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> is sometimes moderated according to reason, and sometimes it lacks moderation, either by excess or by deficiency, and on this account the passion is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Again, the names of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are sometimes employed in the sense of excess, thus we speak of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> meaning not any but excessive <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in which case it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and in the same way daring as implying excess is accounted a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The daring spoken of there is that which is moderated by reason, for in that sense it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is praiseworthy to act quickly after taking counsel, which is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. But to wish to act quickly before taking counsel is not praiseworthy but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; for this would be to act rashly, which is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 58, Article 3). Wherefore daring which leads one to act quickly is so far praiseworthy as it is directed by reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are unnamed, and so also are some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 4,5,6). Hence the names of certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have to be applied to certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: and in order to designate <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> we employ especially the names of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> the object of which is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, fear, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and daring. But hope and love have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for this object, and so we use them rather to designate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether daring is opposed to fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that daring is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For excess of daring seems to result from presumption of mind. But presumption pertains to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Therefore daring is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, daring does not seem to call for blame, except in so far as it results in harm either to the daring <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who puts himself in danger inordinately, or to others whom he attacks with daring, or exposes to danger. But this seemingly pertains to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Therefore daring, as designating a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is opposed, not to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is concerned about fear and daring, as stated above (Question 123, Article 3). Now since timidity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in respect of an excess of fear, there is another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to timidity in respect of a lack of fear. If then, daring is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in the point of excessive daring, there will likewise be a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to it in the point of deficient daring. But there is no such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore neither should daring be accounted a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> in both the Second and Third Books of Ethics accounts daring to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 126, Article 2), it belongs to a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to observe the rational mean in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which it is concerned. Wherefore every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that denotes lack of moderation in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as immoderate to moderate. Now daring, in so far as it denotes a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, implies excess of passion, and this excess goes by the name of daring. Wherefore it is evident that it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which is concerned about fear and daring, as stated above (Question 122, Article 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Opposition between <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not depend chiefly on the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> but on the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice's</a> very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Wherefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that daring be opposed to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as presumption which is its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the direct opposition of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> does not depend on its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so neither does it depend on its effect. Now the harm done by daring is its effect. Wherefore neither does the opposition of daring depend on this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movement of daring consists in a man taking the offensive against that which is in opposition to him: and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines him to do this except in so far as such inclination is hindered by the fear of receiving harm from that source. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which exceeds in daring has no contrary deficiency, save only timidity. Yet daring does not always accompany so great a lack of timidity, for as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7), "the daring are precipitate and eager to meet danger, yet fail when the danger is present," namely through fear.
