<h1>Question 128. The parts of fortitude</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3128.htm#article1">[One Article]</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the parts of fortitude are suitably assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are unsuitably assigned. For Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) assigns four parts to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, namely "magnificence," "confidence," "patience," and "perseverance." Now magnificence seems to pertain to liberality; since both are concerned about money, and "a magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> must needs be liberal," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. iv, 2). But liberality is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 117, Article 5). Therefore magnificence should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, confidence is apparently the same as hope. But hope does not seem to pertain to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but is rather a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by itself. Therefore confidence should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> makes a man behave aright in face of danger. But magnificence and confidence do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> imply any relation to danger. Therefore they are not suitably reckoned as parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) patience denotes endurance of hardships, and he ascribes the same to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore patience is the same as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and not a part thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, that which is a requisite to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should not be reckoned a part of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But perseverance is required in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">Matthew 24:13</a>): "He that shall persevere to the end he shall be saved." Therefore perseverance should not be accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, Macrobius (De Somn. Scip. i) reckons seven parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, namely "magnanimity, confidence, security, magnificence, constancy, forbearance, stability." Andronicus also reckons seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and these are, "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, strength of will, magnanimity, manliness, perseverance, magnificence." Therefore it seems that Tully's reckoning of the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is incomplete.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. iii) reckons five parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. The first is "civic" <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which produces brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> through fear of dishonor or punishment; the second is "military" <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which produces brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as a result of warlike art or experience; the third is the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which produces brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> resulting from passion, especially <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; the fourth is the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which makes a man act bravely through being accustomed to overcome; the fifth is the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which makes a man act bravely through being unaccustomed to danger. Now these kinds of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are not comprised under any of the above enumerations. Therefore these enumerations of the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are unfitting.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#48">Article 48</a>), a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can have three kinds of parts, subjective, integral, and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, taken as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cannot have subjective parts, since it is not divided into several specifically distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for it is about a very special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>However, there are quasi-integral and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts assigned to it: integral parts, with regard to those things the concurrence of which is requisite for an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts, because what <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> practices in face of the greatest hardships, namely dangers of death, certain other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> practice in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of certain minor hardships and these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. As stated above (123, 3,6), the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is twofold, aggression and endurance. Now two things are required for the act of aggression. The first regards preparation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and consists in one's having a mind ready for aggression. On this respect Tully mentions "confidence," of which he says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "with this the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is much assured and firmly hopeful in great and honorable undertakings." The second regards the accomplishment of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, and consists in not failing to accomplish what one has confidently begun. On this respect Tully mentions "magnificence," which he describes as being "the discussion and administration," i.e. accomplishment "of great and lofty undertakings, with a certain broad and noble purpose of mind," so as to combine execution with greatness of purpose. Accordingly if these two be confined to the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, namely to dangers of death, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof, because without them there can be no <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>; whereas if they be referred to other matters involving less hardship, they will be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> specifically distinct from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but annexed thereto as secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to principal: thus "magnificence" is referred by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv) to great expenses, and "magnanimity," which seems to be the same as confidence, to great honors. Again, two things are requisite for the other act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, viz. endurance. The first is that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be not broken by sorrow, and fall away from its greatness, by reason of the stress of threatening <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. On this respect he mentions "patience," which he describes as "the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and prolonged endurance of arduous and difficult things for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or profit." The other is that by the prolonged suffering of hardships <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be not wearied so as to lose <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse3">Hebrews 12:3</a>, "That you be not wearied, fainting in your minds." On this respect he mentions "perseverance," which accordingly he describes as "the fixed and continued persistence in a well considered purpose." If these two be confined to the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof; but if they be referred to any kind of hardship they will be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, yet annexed thereto as secondary to principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Magnificence in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of liberality adds a certain greatness: this is connected with the notion of difficulty which is the object of the irascible faculty, that is perfected chiefly by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: and to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in this respect, it belongs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope whereby one confides in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is accounted a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (17, 5; I-II, 62, 3). But by confidence which here is accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hopes in himself, yet under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> withal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To venture on anything great seems to involve danger, since to fail in such things is very disastrous. Wherefore although magnificence and confidence are referred to the accomplishment of or venturing on any other great things, they have a certain connection with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> by reason of the imminent danger.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Patience endures not only dangers of death, with which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is concerned, without excessive sorrow, but also any other hardships or dangers. On this respect it is accounted a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: but as referred to dangers of death, it is an integral part thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Perseverance as denoting persistence in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> unto the end, may be a circumstance of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but it is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in the sense stated in the body of the Article.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Macrobius reckons the four aforesaid mentioned by Tully, namely "confidence, magnificence, forbearance," which he puts in the place of patience, and "firmness," which he substitutes for perseverance. And he adds three, two of which, namely "magnanimity" and "security," are comprised by Tully under the head of confidence. But Macrobius is more specific in his enumeration. Because confidence denotes a man's hope for great things: and hope for anything presupposes an <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> stretching forth to great things by desire, and this belongs to magnanimity. For it has been stated above (I-II, 40, 2) that hope presupposes love and desire of the thing hoped for.

<p>A still better reply is that confidence pertains to the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of hope; while magnanimity refers to the magnitude of the thing hoped for. Now hope has no firmness unless its contrary be removed, for sometimes one, for one's own part, would hope for something, but hope is avoided on account of the obstacle of fear, since fear is somewhat contrary to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as stated above, (I-II, 40, 4, ad 1). Hence Macrobius adds security, which banishes fear. He adds a third, namely constancy, which may be comprised under magnificence. For in performing <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of magnificence one needs to have a constant mind. For this reason Tully says that magnificence consists not only in accomplishing great things, but also in discussing them generously in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Constancy may also pertain to perseverance, so that one may be called persevering through not desisting on account of delays, and constant through not desisting on account of any other obstacles.

<p>Those that are mentioned by Andronicus seem to amount to the same as the above. For with Tully and Macrobius he mentions "perseverance" and "magnificence," and with Macrobius, "magnanimity." "Strength of will" is the same as patience or forbearance, for he says that "strength of <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that makes one ready to attempt what ought to be attempted, and to endure what reason says should be endured"--i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> seems to be the same as assurance, for he defines it as "strength of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the accomplishment of its purpose." Manliness is apparently the same as confidence, for he says that "manliness is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of self-sufficiency in matters of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Besides magnificence he mentions <em>andragathia</em>, i.e. manly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which we may render "strenuousness." For magnificence consists not only in being constant in the accomplishment of great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which belongs to constancy, but also in bringing a certain manly <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and solicitude to that accomplishment, and this belongs to <em>andragathia</em>, strenuousness: wherefore he says that <em>andragathia</em> is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a man, whereby he thinks out profitable works.

<p>Accordingly it is evident that all these parts may be reduced to the four principal parts mentioned by Tully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> The five mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> fall short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for though they concur in the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, they differ as to motive, as stated above (123, 1, ad 2); wherefore they are not reckoned parts but modes of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.
