<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether magnanimity is about honors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnanimity is not about honors. For magnanimity is in the irascible faculty, as its very name shows, since "magnanimity" signifies greatness of mind, and "mind" denotes the irascible part, as appears from De Anima iii, 42, where the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are desire and mind," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and irascible parts. But <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is a <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> since it is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it seems that magnanimity is not about honors.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since magnanimity is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it must needs be about either <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or operations. Now it is not about operations, for then it would be a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: whence it follows that it is about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Therefore magnanimity is not about honors.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of magnanimity seems to regard pursuit rather than avoidance, for a man is said to be magnanimous because he tends to great things. But the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are praised not for desiring honors, but for shunning them. Therefore magnanimity is not about honors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "magnanimity is about <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and dishonor."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Magnanimity by its very name denotes stretching forth of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to great things. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> bears a relationship to two things, first to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which is the field of its activity, secondly to its proper act, which consists in the right use of such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. And since a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is denominated chiefly from its act, a man is said to be magnanimous chiefly because he is minded to do some great act. Now an act may be called great in two ways: in one way proportionately, in another absolutely. An act may be called great proportionately, even if it consist in the use of some small or ordinary thing, if, for instance, one make a very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of it: but an act is simply and absolutely great when it consists in the best use of the greatest thing.

<p>The things which come into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> use are external things, and among these <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the greatest simply, both because it is the most akin to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is an attestation to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (103, 1 and 2); and because it is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the best; and again because, in order to obtain <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> even as to avoid shame, men set aside all other things. Now a man is said to be magnanimous in respect of things that are great absolutely and simply, just as a man is said to be brave in respect of things that are difficult simply. It follows therefore that magnanimity is about honors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> absolutely considered regard the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, but in so far as the aspect of difficult is added, they belong to the irascible. Thus it is that magnanimity regards <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, inasmuch, to wit, as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> has the aspect of something great or difficult.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is neither a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> nor an operation, yet it is the object of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, namely hope, which tends to a difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore magnanimity is immediately about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of hope, and mediately about <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as the object of hope: even so, we have stated (123, 4,5) with regard to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that it is about dangers of death in so far as they are the object of fear and daring.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those are worthy of praise who despise <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> in such a way as to do nothing unbecoming in order to obtain them, nor have too great a desire for them. If, however, one were to despise honors so as not to care to do what is worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, this would be deserving of blame. Accordingly magnanimity is about honors in the sense that a man strives to do what is deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, yet not so as to think much of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> accorded by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether magnanimity is essentially about great honors?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnanimity is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> about great honors. For the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnanimity is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But great and little are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to magnanimity to be about great honors.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as magnanimity is about <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, so is meekness about <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to meekness to be about either great or little <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore neither is it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to magnanimity to be about great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, small <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is less aloof from great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> than is dishonor. But magnanimity is well ordered in relation to dishonor, and consequently in relation to small honors also. Therefore it is not only about great honors.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7) that magnanimity is about great honors.

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Phys. vii, 17, 18), <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a perfection, and by this we are to understand the perfection of a power, and that it regards the extreme limit of that power, as stated in De Coelo i, 116. Now the perfection of a power is not perceived in every operation of that power, but in such operations as are great or difficult: for every power, however imperfect, can extend to ordinary and trifling operations. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 3.

<p>Now the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (which amount to the same) in an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be considered from two points of view. First, from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in so far as it is difficult to find and establish the rational means in some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and this difficulty is found only in the act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and also of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The other difficulty is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which may involve a certain opposition to the moderation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which moderation has to be applied thereto: and this difficulty regards chiefly the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> resist reason as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv, 4).

<p>Now as regards the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> it is to be observed that the greatness of this power of resistance to reason arises chiefly in some cases from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> themselves, and in others from the things that are the objects of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> themselves have no great power of resistance, unless they be <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, because the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is the seat of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence the resisting <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> regard only that which is great in such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about very great fear and daring; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> about the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the greatest pleasures, and likewise meekness about the greatest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. On the other hand, some <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> have great power of resistance to reason arising from the external things themselves that are the objects of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: such are the love or desire of money or of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And for these it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only regarding that which is greatest in those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but also about that which is ordinary or little: because things external, though they be little, are very desirable, as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Hence with regard to the desire of money there are two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, one about ordinary or little sums of money, namely liberality, and another about large sums of money, namely "magnificence."

<p>In like manner there are two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about honors, one about ordinary honors. This <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has no name, but is denominated by its extremes, which are <em>philotimia</em>, i.e. love of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and <em>aphilotimia</em>, i.e. without love of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: for sometimes a man is commended for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and sometimes for not caring about it, in so far, to wit, as both these things may be done in moderation. But with regard to great honors there is "magnanimity." Wherefore we must conclude that the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnanimity is great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and that a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tends to such things as are deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Great and little are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> considered in itself: but they make a great difference in their relation to reason, the mode of which has to be observed in the use of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, for it is much more difficult to observe it in great than in little honors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and other matters only that which is greatest presents any notable difficulty, and about this alone is there any need of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is different with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and honors which are things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He that makes <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of great things is much more able to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of little things. Accordingly the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> looks upon great honors as a thing of which he is worthy, or even little honors as something he deserves, because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot sufficiently <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which deserves to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence he is not uplifted by great honors, because he does not deem them above him; rather does he despise them, and much more such as are ordinary or little. On like manner he is not cast down by dishonor, but despises it, since he recognizes that he does not deserve it.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether magnanimity is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean. But magnanimity observes not the mean but the greater extreme: because the "magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deems himself worthy of the greatest things" (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he that has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has them all, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). But one may have a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without having magnanimity: since the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "whosoever is worthy of little things and deems himself worthy of them, is temperate, but he is not magnanimous." Therefore magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Virtue is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>," as stated above (I-II, 55, 4). But magnanimity implies certain dispositions of the body: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) of "a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that his gait is slow, his voice deep, and his utterance calm." Therefore magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But magnanimity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, since "the magnanimous deems himself worthy of great things, and despises others," according to Ethic. iv, 3. Therefore magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the properties of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are praiseworthy. But magnanimity has certain properties that call for blame. For, in the first place, the magnanimous is unmindful of favors; secondly, he is remiss and slow of action; thirdly, he employs irony [Cf. 113] towards many; fourthly, he is unable to associate with others; fifthly, because he holds to the barren things rather than to those that are fruitful. Therefore magnanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written in praise of certain men (<a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#verse18">2 Maccabees 15:18</a>): "Nicanor hearing of the valor of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas'</a> companions, and the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> [animi magnitudinem] with which they fought for their country, was afraid to try the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by the sword." Now, only <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are worthy of praise. Therefore magnanimity which consists in greatness of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, for this is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now among external <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things honors take precedence of all others, as stated above (1; I-II, 11, 2, Objection 3). Therefore magnanimity, which observes the mode of reason in great honors, is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> again says (Ethic. iv, 3), "the magnanimous in point of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> goes to extremes," in so far as he tends to what is greatest, "but in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of becomingness, he follows the mean," because he tends to the greatest things according to reason, for "he deems himself worthy in accordance with his worth" (Ethic. iv, 3), since his aims do not surpass his deserts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mutual connection of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> does not apply to their acts, as though every one were competent to practice the acts of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Wherefore the act of magnanimity is not becoming to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only to great men. on the other hand, as regards the principles of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected together, since their <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> reside together in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, either in act or by way of a proximate disposition thereto. Thus it is possible for one to whom the act of magnanimity is not competent, to have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of magnanimity, whereby he is disposed to practice that act if it were competent to him according to his state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movements of the body are differentiated according to the different apprehensions and emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And so it happens that to magnanimity there accrue certain fixed <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> by way of bodily movements. For quickness of movement results from a man being intent on many things which he is in a hurry to accomplish, whereas the magnanimous is intent only on great things; these are few and require great attention, wherefore they call for slow movement. Likewise shrill and rapid speaking is chiefly competent to those who are quick to quarrel about anything, and this becomes not the magnanimous who are busy only about great things. And just as these dispositions of bodily movements are competent to the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the mode of his emotions, so too in those who are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> disposed to magnanimity these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are found <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> something great which he possesses through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and something defective which accrues to him through the weakness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Accordingly magnanimity makes a man deem himself worthy of great things in consideration of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> he holds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: thus if his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is endowed with great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, magnanimity makes him tend to perfect works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the same is to be said of the use of any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, such as science or external fortune. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> makes a man think little of himself in consideration of his own deficiency, and magnanimity makes him despise others in so far as they fall away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>: since he does not think so much of others as to do anything wrong for their sake. Yet <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> makes us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> others and esteem them better than ourselves, in so far as we see some of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> in them. Hence it is written of the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse4">Psalm 14:4</a>): "In his sight a vile <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is contemned [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'The malignant is brought to nothing, but he glorifieth,' etc.]," which indicates the contempt of magnanimity, "but he honoreth them that fear the Lord," which points to the reverential bearing of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. It is therefore evident that magnanimity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> are not contrary to one another, although they seem to tend in contrary directions, because they proceed according to different considerations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> These properties in so far as they belong to a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> call not for blame, but for very great praise. For in the first place, when it is said that the magnanimous is not mindful of those from whom he has received favors, this points to the fact that he takes no pleasure in accepting favors from others unless he repay them with yet greater favor; this belongs to the perfection of gratitude, in the act of which he wishes to excel, even as in the acts of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Again, in the second place, it is said that he is remiss and slow of action, not that he is lacking in doing what becomes him, but because he does not busy himself with all kinds of works, but only with great works, such as are becoming to him. He is also said, in the third place, to employ irony, not as opposed to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and so as either to say of himself vile things that are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or deny of himself great things that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but because he does not disclose all his greatness, especially to the large number of those who are beneath him, since, as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3), "it belongs to a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be great towards <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of dignity and affluence, and unassuming towards the middle class." On the fourth place, it is said that he cannot associate with others: this means that he is not at home with others than his friends: because he altogether shuns flattery and hypocrisy, which belong to littleness of mind. But he associates with all, both great and little, according as he ought, as stated above (ad 1). It is also said, fifthly, that he prefers to have barren things, not indeed any, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; for in all things he prefers the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> to the useful, as being greater: since the useful is sought in order to supply a defect which is inconsistent with magnanimity.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether magnanimity is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnanimity is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is operative in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iv, 3) that "whatever is great in each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belongs to the magnanimous." Therefore magnanimity is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the acts of different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not ascribed to any special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the acts of different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are ascribed to the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is stated in Ethic. iv, 3 that "it belongs to the magnanimous not to avoid reproof" (which is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>), "nor to act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>" (which is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>), "that he is ready to do favors" (which is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>), "that he gives his services readily" (which is an act of liberality), that "he is truthful" (which is an act of truthfulness), and that "he is not given to complaining" (which is an act of patience). Therefore magnanimity is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a special ornament of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," and afterwards he adds, "and as a bride adorned with her jewels." But magnanimity is the ornament of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv. Therefore magnanimity is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7) distinguishes it from the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 123, Article 2), it belongs to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to establish the mode of reason in a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now magnanimity establishes the mode of reason in a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely honors, as stated above (1 and 2): and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, considered in itself, is a special <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and accordingly magnanimity considered in itself is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the reward of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (103, 1, ad 2), it follows that by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> it regards all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Magnanimity is not about any kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to a great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is that the magnanimous is intent on doing great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far, to wit, as he tends to what is worthy of great honors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the magnanimous tends to great things, it follows that he tends chiefly to things that involve a certain excellence, and shuns those that imply defect. Now it savors of excellence that a man is beneficent, generous and grateful. Wherefore he shows himself ready to perform actions of this kind, but not as acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. on the other hand, it is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of defect, that a man thinks so much of certain external goods or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that for their sake he abandons and gives up <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whatever. Again, all concealment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> indicates a defect, since it seems to be the outcome of fear. Also that a man be given to complaining denotes a defect, because by so doing the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> seems to give way to external <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Wherefore these and like things the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> avoids under a special aspect, inasmuch as they are contrary to his excellence or greatness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives from its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> a certain luster or adornment which is proper to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but further adornment results from the very greatness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, through magnanimity which makes all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> greater as stated in Ethic. iv, 3.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether magnanimity is a part of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnanimity is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For a thing is not a part of itself. But magnanimity appears to be the same as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For Seneca says (De Quat. Virtut.): "If magnanimity, which is also called <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, be in thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, thou shalt live in great assurance": and Tully says (De Offic. i): "If a man is brave we expect him to be magnanimous, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>-loving, and far removed from deception." Therefore magnanimity is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3) says that a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not <em>philokindynos</em>, that is, a lover of danger. But it belongs to a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to expose himself to danger. Therefore magnanimity has nothing in common with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> so as to be called a part thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, magnanimity regards the great in things to be hoped for, whereas <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards the great in things to be feared or dared. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is of more import than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore magnanimity is a more important <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore it is not a part thereof.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius (De Somn. Scip. i) and Andronicus reckon magnanimity as a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 61, 3), a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one to which it belongs to establish a general mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in a principal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now one of the general modes of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is firmness of mind, because "a firm standing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," according to Ethic. ii. And this is chiefly commended in those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that tend to something difficult, in which it is most difficult to preserve firmness. Wherefore the more difficult it is to stand firm in some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of difficulty, the more principal is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which makes the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> firm in that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Now it is more difficult to stand firm in dangers of death, wherein <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> confirms the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, than in hoping for or obtaining the greatest goods, wherein the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is confirmed by magnanimity, for, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> loves his life above all things, so does he fly from dangers of death more than any others. Accordingly it is clear that magnanimity agrees with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in confirming the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> about some difficult <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but it falls short thereof, in that it confirms the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein it is easier to stand firm. Hence magnanimity is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because it is annexed thereto as secondary to principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 1,3), "to lack <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is looked upon as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," wherefore not to be overcome by a grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, such as the danger of death, is looked upon as though it were the obtaining of a great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the former belonging to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and the latter to magnanimity: in this sense <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and magnanimity may be considered as identical. Since, however, there is a difference as regards the difficulty on the part of either of the aforesaid, it follows that properly speaking magnanimity, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7), is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to love danger when he exposes himself to all kinds of dangers, which seems to be the mark of one who thinks "many" the same as "great." This is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for no one seemingly exposes himself to danger for the sake of a thing that he does not deem great. But for things that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great, a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is most ready to expose himself to danger, since he does something great in the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, even as in the acts of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7) that the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not <em>mikrokindynos</em>, i.e. endangering himself for small things, but <em>megalokindynos</em>, i.e. endangering himself for great things. And Seneca says (De Quat. Virtut.): "Thou wilt be magnanimous if thou neither seekest dangers like a rash <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor fearest them like a coward. For nothing makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a coward save the consciousness of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> as such is to be avoided: and that one has to withstand it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>; in so far, to wit, as one has to suffer an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in order to safeguard a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as such is to be desired, and that one avoids it is only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, in so far, to wit, as it is deemed to surpass the ability of the one who desires it. Now that which is so <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> is always of more account than that which is so <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Wherefore the difficult in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things is always more opposed to firmness of mind than the difficult in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> takes precedence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of magnanimity. For though <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is simply of more import than <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is of more import in this particular respect.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether confidence belongs to magnanimity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that confidence does not belong to magnanimity. For a man may have assurance not only in himself, but also in another, according to <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 3:4-5</a>, "Such confidence we have, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves, as of ourselves." But this seems inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of magnanimity. Therefore confidence does not belong to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, confidence seems to be opposed to fear, according to <a href="../bible/isa012.htm#verse2">Isaiah 12:2</a>, "I will deal confidently and will not fear." But to be without fear seems more akin to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore confidence also belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> rather than to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, reward is not due except to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But a reward is due to confidence, according to <a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse6">Hebrews 3:6</a>, where it is said that we are the house of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "if we hold fast the confidence and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of hope unto the end." Therefore confidence is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from magnanimity: and this is confirmed by the fact that Macrobius enumerates it with magnanimity (In Somn. Scip. i).

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Suv. Rhet. ii) seems to substitute confidence for magnanimity, as stated above in the preceding Question (ad 6) and in the prologue to this.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Confidence takes its name from "fides" [<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>]: and it belongs to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> something and in somebody. But confidence belongs to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job011.htm#verse18">Job 11:18</a>, "Thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee." Wherefore confidence apparently denotes chiefly that a man derives hope through <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the word of one who promises to help him. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> signifies also a strong opinion, and since one may come to have a strong opinion about something, not only on account of another's statement, but also on account of something we observe in another, it follows that confidence may denote the hope of having something, which hope we conceive through observing something either in oneself--for instance, through observing that he is healthy, a man is confident that he will live long. or in another, for instance, through observing that another is friendly to him and powerful, a man is confident that he will receive help from him.

<p>Now it has been stated above (1, ad 2) that magnanimity is chiefly about the hope of something difficult. Wherefore, since confidence denotes a certain strength of hope arising from some observation which gives one a strong opinion that one will obtain a certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that confidence belongs to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3), it belongs to the "magnanimous to need nothing," for need is a mark of the deficient. But this is to be understood according to the mode of a man, hence he adds "or scarcely anything." For it surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to need nothing at all. For every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs, first, the Divine assistance, secondly, even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assistance, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> a social animal, for he is sufficient by himself to provide for his own life. Accordingly, in so far as he needs others, it belongs to a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have confidence in others, for it is also a point of excellence in a man that he should have at hand those who are able to be of service to him. And in so far as his own ability goes, it belongs to a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be confident in himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 23, 2; I-II, 40, 4), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, hope is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, because the latter is about the same object, namely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But as regards contrariety of objects it is opposed to fear, because the latter's object is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now confidence denotes a certain strength of hope, wherefore it is opposed to fear even as hope is. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> properly strengthens a man in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and magnanimity in respect of the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that confidence belongs more properly to magnanimity than to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Yet because hope <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> daring, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, it follows in consequence that confidence pertains to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Confidence, as stated above, denotes a certain mode of hope: for confidence is hope strengthened by a strong opinion. Now the mode applied to an affection may call for commendation of the act, so that it become <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, yet it is not this that draws it to a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence, properly speaking, confidence cannot denote a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though it may denote the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For this reason it is reckoned among the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, not as an annexed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, except as identified with magnanimity by Tully (De Suv. Rhet. ii), but as an integral part, as stated in the preceding Question.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether security belongs to magnanimity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that security does not belong to magnanimity. For security, as stated above (128, ad 6), denotes freedom from the disturbance of fear. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> does this most effectively. Wherefore security is seemingly the same as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> does not belong to magnanimity; rather the reverse is the case. Neither therefore does security belong to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that a man "is said to be secure because he is without care." But this seems to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which has a care for honorable things, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse15">2 Timothy 2:15</a>, "Carefully study to present thyself approved unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore security does not belong to magnanimity, which does great things in all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not its own reward. But security is accounted the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job011.htm#verse14">Job 11:14-18</a>, "If thou wilt put away from thee the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> that is in thy hand . . . being buried thou shalt sleep secure." Therefore security does not belong to magnanimity or to any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as a part thereof.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading: "Magnanimity consists of two things," that "it belongs to magnanimity to give way neither to a troubled mind, nor to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor to fortune." But a man's security consists in this. Therefore security belongs to magnanimity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), "fear makes a man take counsel," because, to wit he takes care to avoid what he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>. Now security takes its name from the removal of this care, of which fear is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: wherefore security denotes perfect freedom of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from fear, just as confidence denotes strength of hope. Now, as hope directly belongs to magnanimity, so fear directly regards <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Wherefore as confidence belongs immediately to magnanimity, so security belongs immediately to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p>It must be observed, however, that as hope is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of daring, so is fear the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, as stated above when we were treating of the passion (I-II, 45, 2). Wherefore as confidence belongs indirectly to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in so far as it makes use of daring, so security belongs indirectly to magnanimity, in so far as it banishes <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fortitude is chiefly commended, not because it banishes fear, which belongs to security, but because it denotes a firmness of mind in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the passion. Wherefore security is not the same as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not all security is worthy of praise but only when one puts care aside, as one ought, and in things when one should not fear: in this way it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and of magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> a certain likeness to, and participation of, future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as stated above (I-II, 05, 3,7). Hence nothing hinders a certain security from being a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although perfect security belongs to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> reward.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether goods of fortune conduce to magnanimity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that goods of fortune do not conduce to magnanimity. For according to Seneca (De Ira i: De vita beata xvi): "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> suffices for itself." Now magnanimity takes every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> great, as stated above (4, ad 3). Therefore goods of fortune do not conduce to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises what is helpful to him. But the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises whatever pertains to goods of fortune: for Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading: "Magnanimity consists of two things," that "a great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is commended for despising external things." Therefore a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not helped by goods of fortune.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully adds (De Offic. i) that "it belongs to a great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so to bear what seems troublesome, as nowise to depart from his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> estate, or from the dignity of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." And <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not grieve at misfortune." Now troubles and misfortunes are opposed to goods of fortune, for every one grieves at the loss of what is helpful to him. Therefore external goods of fortune do not conduce to magnanimity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fortune seems to conduce to magnanimity."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), magnanimity regards two things: <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the accomplishment of something great as its end. Now goods of fortune conduce to both these things. For since <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is conferred on the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, not only by the wise, but also by the multitude who hold these goods of fortune in the highest esteem, the result is that they show greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to those who possess goods of fortune. Likewise goods of fortune are useful organs or instruments of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: since we can easily accomplish things by means of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, power and friends. Hence it is evident that goods of fortune conduce to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue is said to be sufficient for itself, because it can be without even these external goods; yet it needs them in order to act more expeditiously.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises external goods, inasmuch as he does not think them so great as to be bound to do anything unbecoming for their sake. Yet he does not despise them, but that he esteems them useful for the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If a man does not think much of a thing, he is neither very <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> at obtaining it, nor very grieved at losing it. Wherefore, since the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not think much of external goods, that is goods of fortune, he is neither much uplifted by them if he has them, nor much cast down by their loss.
