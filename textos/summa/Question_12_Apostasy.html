<h1>Question 12. Apostasy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3012.htm#article1"> Does apostasy pertain to unbelief?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3012.htm#article2"> On account of apostasy from the faith, are subjects absolved from allegiance to an apostate prince?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether apostasy pertains to unbelief?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that apostasy does not pertain to unbelief. For that which is the origin of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, does not, seemingly, pertain to unbelief, since many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> there are without unbelief. Now apostasy seems to be the origin of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>): "The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is apostasy [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'to fall off'] from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and further on, (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>): "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore apostasy does not pertain to unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, unbelief is an act of the understanding: whereas apostasy seems rather to consist in some outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or utterance, or even in some inward act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse12">Proverbs 6:12-14</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, an unprofitable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> walketh with a perverse mouth. He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger. With a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> heart he deviseth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and at all times he soweth discord." Moreover if anyone were to have himself <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, or to worship at the tomb of Mahomet, he would be deemed an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. Therefore apostasy does not pertain to unbelief.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, since it pertains to unbelief, is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief. If then, apostasy pertained to unbelief, it would follow that it is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of unbelief, which does not seem to agree with what has been said (10, 5). Therefore apostasy does not pertain to unbelief.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John 6:67</a>): "Many of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went back," i.e. apostatized, of whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> had said previously (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse65">John 6:65</a>): "There are some of you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not." Therefore apostasy pertains to unbelief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Apostasy denotes a backsliding from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This may happen in various ways according to the different kinds of union between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, in the first place, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; secondly, by having his will duly submissive in obeying His commandments; thirdly, by certain special things pertaining to supererogation such as the religious life, the clerical state, or Holy Orders. Now if that which follows be removed, that which precedes, remains, but the converse does not hold. Accordingly a man may apostatize from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by withdrawing from the religious life to which he was bound by profession, or from the Holy Order which he had received: and this is called "apostasy from religious life" or "Orders." A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may also apostatize from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by rebelling in his mind against the Divine commandments: and though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may apostatize in both the above ways, he may still remain united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>But if he give up the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then he seems to turn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> altogether: and consequently, apostasy simply and absolutely is that whereby a man withdraws from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is called "apostasy of perfidy." On this way apostasy, simply so called, pertains to unbelief.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection refers to the second kind of apostasy, which denotes an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in rebellion against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments, an act that is to be found in every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only that the heart should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but also that external words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> should bear witness to the inward <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for confession is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On this way too, certain external words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> pertain to unbelief, in so far as they are signs of unbelief, even as a sign of health is said itself to be healthy. Now although the authority quoted may be understood as referring to every kind of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, yet it applies most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the first foundation of things to be hoped for, and since, without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is "impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; when once <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is removed, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> retains nothing that may be useful for the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for which reason it is written (<a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse12">Proverbs 6:12</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, an unprofitable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>": because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans 1:17</a>: "The just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore, just as when the life of the body is taken away, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> every member and part loses its due disposition, so when the life of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is done away, disorder appears in all his members. First, in his mouth, whereby chiefly his mind stands revealed; secondly, in his eyes; thirdly, in the instrument of movement; fourthly, in his will, which tends to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The result is that "he sows discord," endeavoring to sever others from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even as he severed himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> or form are not diversified by the fact of its being the term "wherefrom" or "whereto" of movement: on the contrary, it is the movement that takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the terms. Now apostasy regards unbelief as the term "whereto" of the movement of withdrawal from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; wherefore apostasy does not imply a special kind of unbelief, but an aggravating circumstance thereof, according to <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse21">2 Peter 2:21</a>: "It had been better for them not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>'], than after they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, to turn back."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether a prince forfeits his dominion over his subjects, on account of apostasy from the faith, so that they no longer owe him allegiance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a prince does not so forfeit his dominion over his subjects, on account of apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they no longer owe him allegiance. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Super <a href="../bible/psa124.htm#verse3">Psalm 124:3</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Emperor Julian</a>, though an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, nevertheless had under him <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers, who when he said to them, "Fall into line for the defense of the republic," were bound to obey. Therefore subjects are not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from their allegiance to their prince on account of his apostasy.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is an unbeliever. Now we find that certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men served unbelieving masters; thus <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> served <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> served <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, and Mardochai served Assuerus. Therefore apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not release subjects from allegiance to their sovereign.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as by apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a man turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so does every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently if, on account of apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, princes were to lose their right to command those of their subjects who are believers, they would equally lose it on account of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: which is evidently not the case. Therefore we ought not to refuse allegiance to a sovereign on account of his apostatizing from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> says (Council, Roman V): "Holding to the institutions of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> predecessors, we, by our apostolic authority, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> from their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> those who through loyalty or through the sacred bond of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> owe allegiance to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: and we absolutely forbid them to continue their allegiance to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, until these shall have made amends." Now apostates from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, like <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> [Extra, De Haereticis, cap. Ad abolendam]. Therefore princes should not be obeyed when they have apostatized from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 10, Article 10), unbelief, in itself, is not inconsistent with dominion, since dominion is a device of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of nations which is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: whereas the distinction between believers and unbelievers is of Divine right, which does not annul <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> right. Nevertheless a man who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by unbelief may be sentenced to the loss of his right of dominion, as also, sometimes, on account of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>Now it is not within the competency of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to punish unbelief in those who have never received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>): "What have I to do to judge them that are without?" She can, however, pass sentence of punishment on the unbelief of those who have received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and it is fitting that they should be punished by being deprived of the allegiance of their subjects: for this same allegiance might conduce to great corruption of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since, as was stated above (1, Objection 2), "a man that is an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> . . . with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> heart deviseth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and . . . soweth discord," in order to sever others from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, as soon as sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is passed on a man on account of apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his subjects are "ipso facto" <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from his authority and from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance whereby they were bound to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> At that time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was but recently instituted, and had not, as yet, the power of curbing earthly princes; and so she allowed the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to obey <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, in matters that were not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order to avoid incurring a yet greater danger.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated in the article, it is not a question of those unbelievers who have never received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> severs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> altogether, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), which is not the case in any other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
