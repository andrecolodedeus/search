<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any created intellect can see the essence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can see the essence of God. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xiv. in Joan.) <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a>, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at any time," says: "Not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> only, but neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor archangels have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For how can a creature see what is increatable?" <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> also says (Div. Nom. i), speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Neither is there sense, nor image, nor opinion, nor reason, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everything <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as such, is unknown. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as was shown above (Question 7, Article 1). Therefore in Himself He is unknown.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> things. For what falls first under the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is being. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>; but He is rather super-existence, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not intelligible; but above all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there must be some proportion between the knower and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is the perfection of the knower. But no proportion <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> between the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for there is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> distance between them. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "We shall see Him as He is" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since everything is knowable according as it is actual, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> without any admixture of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, is in Himself supremely knowable. But what is supremely knowable in itself, may not be knowable to a particular <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, on account of the excess of the intelligible object above the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; as, for example, the sun, which is supremely visible, cannot be seen by the bat by reason of its excess of light.

<p>Therefore some who considered this, held that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This opinion, however, is not tenable. For as the ultimate beatitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in the use of his highest function, which is the operation of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; if we suppose that the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> could never see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would either never attain to beatitude, or its beatitude would consist in something else beside <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the ultimate perfection of the rational creature is to be found in that which is the principle of its being; since a thing is perfect so far as it attains to its principle. Further the same opinion is also against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For there resides in every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of any effect which he sees; and thence arises wonder in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the rational creature could not reach so far as to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire would remain void.

<p>Hence it must be absolutely granted that the blessed see the essence of God.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Both of these authorities speak of the vision of comprehension. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> premises immediately before the words cited, "He is universally to all incomprehensible," etc. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> likewise after the words quoted says: "He says this of the most certain vision ofthe Father, which is such a perfect consideration and comprehension as the Father has of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> not made perfect by form, is unknown in itself, because all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes by the form; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the form not limited by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, is in itself supremely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> in this way, and not in the first way: as appears from what was said above (Question 7, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not said to be not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> as if He did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> at all, but because He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> above all that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>; inasmuch as He is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Hence it does not follow that He cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at all, but that He exceeds every kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; which means that He is not comprehended.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Proportion is twofold. In one sense it means a certain relation of one <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> to another, according as double, treble and equal are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of proportion. In another sense every relation of one thing to another is called proportion. And in this sense there can be a proportion of the creature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as it is related to Him as the effect of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to its act; and in this way the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be proportioned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the essence of God is seen by the created intellect through an image?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen through an image by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For it is written: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him, and [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v): "When we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, some likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made in us."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act is the actual intelligible; as sense in act is the actual sensible. But this comes about inasmuch as sense is informed with the likeness of the sensible object, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with the likeness of the thing understood. Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act, it must be that He is seen by some similitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv) that when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "We see through a glass and in an enigma [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'in a dark manner']," "by the terms 'glass' and 'enigma' certain similitudes are signified by him, which are accommodated to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>." But to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not an enigmatic nor a speculative vision, but is, on the contrary, of an opposite kind. Therefore the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not seen through a similitude.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are required both for sensible and for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision--viz. power of sight, and union of the thing seen with the sight. For vision is made actual only when the thing seen is in a certain way in the seer. Now in corporeal things it is clear that the thing seen cannot be by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in the seer, but only by its likeness; as the similitude of a stone is in the eye, whereby the vision is made actual; whereas the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the stone is not there. But if the principle of the visual power and the thing seen were one and the same thing, it would <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follow that the seer would receive both the visual power and the form whereby it sees, from that one same thing.

<p>Now it is manifest both that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> power, and that He can be seen by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power of the creature is not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that it is some kind of participated likeness of Him who is the first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power of the creature is called an intelligible light, as it were, derived from the first light, whether this be understood of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, or of some perfection superadded of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore, in order to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there must be some similitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the part of the visual faculty, whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is made capable of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But on the part of the object seen, which must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be united to the seer, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be seen by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> similitude.

<p>First, because as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i), "by the similitudes of the inferior order of things, the superior can in no way be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>;" as by the likeness of a body the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of an incorporeal thing cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Much less therefore can the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be seen by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> likeness whatever.

<p>Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 4), which cannot be said of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> form; and so no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> form can be the similitude representing the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the seer.

<p>Thirdly, because the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is uncircumscribed, and contains in itself super-eminently whatever can be signified or understood by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now this cannot in any way be represented by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> likeness; for every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> form is determined according to some aspect of wisdom, or of power, or of being itself, or of some like thing. Hence to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by some similitude, is to say that the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not seen at all; which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Therefore it must be said that to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is required some similitude in the visual faculty, namely, the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> strengthening the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is spoken of in the <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>, "In Thy light we shall see light." The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, cannot be seen by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> similitude representing the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself as it really is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That authority speaks of the similitude which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by participation of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> here on earth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself. Hence as other intelligible forms which are not their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are united to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by means of some entity, whereby the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself is informed, and made in act; so the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as the object actually understood, making the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act by and of itself.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the essence of God can be seen with the bodily eye?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen by the corporeal eye. For it is written (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse26">Job 19:26</a>): "In my flesh I shall see . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and (<a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse5">Job 42:5</a>), "With the hearing of the ear I have heard Thee, but now my eye seeth Thee."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xxix, 29): "Those eyes" (namely the glorified) "will therefore have a greater power of sight, not so much to see more keenly, as some report of the sight of serpents or of eagles (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by these creatures, they can see only corporeal things) but to see even incorporeal things." Now whoever can see incorporeal things, can be raised up to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the glorified eye can see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through a vision of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. For it is written: "I saw the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sitting upon a throne," etc. (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>). But an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision originates from sense; for the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is moved by sense to act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen by a vision of sense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vid. Deum, Ep. cxlvii): "No one has ever seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either in this life, as He is, nor in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> life, as visible things are seen by corporeal vision."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be seen by the sense of sight, or by any other sense, or faculty of the sensitive power. For every such kind of power is the act of a corporeal organ, as will be shown later (78). Now act is proportional to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which possesses it. Hence no power of that kind can go beyond corporeal things. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incorporeal, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 1). Hence He cannot be seen by the sense or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, but only by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words, "In my flesh I shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> my Saviour," do not mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be seen with the eye of the flesh, but that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the flesh after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Likewise the words, "Now my eye seeth Thee," are to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> eye, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "May He give unto you the spirit of wisdom . . . in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, that the eyes of your heart" may be "enlightened" (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks as one inquiring, and conditionally. This appears from what he says previously: "Therefore they will have an altogether different power (viz. the glorified eyes), if they shall see that incorporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>;" and afterwards he explains this, saying: "It is very credible, that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the new heaven and the new earth, as to see most clearly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> everywhere present, governing all corporeal things, not as we now see the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as understood by what is made; but as when we see men among whom we live, living and exercising the functions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> they live, but see it." Hence it is evident how the glorified eyes will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as now our eyes see the life of another. But life is not seen with the corporeal eye, as a thing in itself visible, but as the indirect object of the sense; which indeed is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by sense, but at once, together with sense, by some other cognitive power. But that the divine presence is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> immediately on the sight of, and through, corporeal things, happens from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>--viz. from the perspicuity of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and from the refulgence of the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> infused into the body after its renovation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not seen in a vision of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> receives some form representing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to some mode of similitude; as in the divine <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> divine things are metaphorically described by means of sensible things.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether any created intellect by its natural powers can see the Divine essence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is a pure mirror, most clear, receiving, if it is right to say so, the whole beauty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But if a reflection is seen, the original thing is seen. Therefore since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power understands himself, it seems that by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power he understands the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is supremely visible, is made less visible to us by reason of our defective corporeal or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has no such defect. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely intelligible in Himself, it seems that in like manner He is supremely so to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Therefore, if he can understand other intelligible things by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, much more can he understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, corporeal sense cannot be raised up to understand incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, which is above its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore if to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it follows that no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can reach up to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at all. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as appears from what is said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore it seems that it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is life everlasting" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans 6:23</a>). But life everlasting consists in the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according to the words: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>). Therefore to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is possible to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is regulated according as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower. But the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower according to the mode of the knower. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of every knower is ruled according to its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If therefore the mode of anything's being exceeds the mode of the knower, it must result that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the object is above the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the knower. Now the mode of being of things is manifold. For some things have being only in this one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; as all bodies. But others are subsisting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, not residing in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> at all, which, however, are not their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but receive it; and these are the incorporeal beings, called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone does it belong to be His own subsistent being. Therefore what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> only in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, forasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is the form of certain <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possesses two cognitive powers; one is the act of a corporeal organ, which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; hence sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only the singular. But there is another kind of cognitive power in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and this is not the act of any corporeal organ. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> natures which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> only in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; not as they are in such <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but according as they are abstracted therefrom by the considering act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; hence it follows that through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> we can understand these objects as universal; and this is beyond the power of the sense. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> natures that are not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but this is beyond the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the state of its present life, united as it is to the body. It follows therefore that to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> self-subsistent being is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone; and this is beyond the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for no creature is its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, forasmuch as its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is participated. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unites Himself to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as an object made intelligible to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>--namely, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him by His own likeness refulgent in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> himself. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> similitude is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Hence it does not follow that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his own power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not defective, if defect be taken to mean privation, as if it were without anything which it ought to have. But if the defect be taken negatively, in that sense every creature is defective, when compared with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; forasmuch as it does not possess the excellence which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The sense of sight, as being altogether material, cannot be raised up to immateriality. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, inasmuch as it is elevated above <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can be raised up above its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to a higher level by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is, that sight cannot in any way <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> abstractedly what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> concretely; for in no way can it perceive a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> except as this one particular <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is able to consider abstractedly what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> concretely. Now although it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things which have a form residing in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, still it resolves the composite into both of these elements; and it considers the form separately by itself. Likewise, also, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, although it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the concrete in any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, still it is able to separate that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; since it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the thing itself is one thing, and its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is another. Since therefore the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> capable of apprehending the concrete form, and the concrete being <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstractedly</a>, by way of a kind of resolution of parts; it can by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be raised up to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> separate subsisting <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and separate subsisting <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the created intellect needs any created light in order to see the essence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not need any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light in order to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what is of itself lucid in sensible things does not require any other light in order to be seen. Therefore the same applies to intelligible things. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is intelligible light. Therefore He is not seen by means of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen through a medium, He is not seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But if seen by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light, He is seen through a medium. Therefore He is not seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to some creature. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen through any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light, such a light can be made <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to some other creature; and thus, that creature would not need any other light to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is impossible. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that every creature should require a superadded light in order to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "In Thy light we shall see light" (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Everything which is raised up to what exceeds its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, must be prepared by some disposition above its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as, for example, if air is to receive the form of fire, it must be prepared by some disposition for such a form. But when any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> sees the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> itself becomes the intelligible form of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> disposition should be added to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in order that it may be raised up to such a great and sublime height. Now since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not avail to enable it to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was shown in the preceding article, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the power of understanding should be added by divine <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Now this increase of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers is called the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as we also call the intelligible object itself by the name of light of illumination. And this is the light spoken of in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse23">Apocalypse 21:23</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath enlightened it"--viz. the society of the blessed who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By this light the blessed are made "deiform"--i.e. like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the saying: "When He shall appear we shall be like to Him, and [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1 John 2:2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in order to make the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intelligible, which is of itself intelligible, but in order to enable the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand in the same way as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> makes a power abler to act. Even so corporeal light is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as regards external sight, inasmuch as it makes the medium actually transparent, and susceptible of color.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This light is required to see the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, not as a similitude in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, but as a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, strengthening it to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it may be said that this light is to be described not as a medium in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, but as one by which He is seen; and such a medium does not take away the immediate <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The disposition to the form of fire can be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> only to the subject of that form. Hence the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to a creature unless the creature has a divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; which is impossible. But by this light the rational creature is made deiform, as is said in this article.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether of those who see the essence of God, one sees more perfectly than another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that of those who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one does not see more perfectly than another. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1 John 3:2</a>): "We shall see Him as He is." But He is only in one way. Therefore He will be seen by all in one way only; and therefore He will not be seen more perfectly by one and less perfectly by another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xxxii): "One <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot see one and the same thing more perfectly than another." But all who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, understand the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and not by sense, as was shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore of those who see the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, one does not see more clearly than another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, That anything be seen more perfectly than another can happen in two ways: either on the part of the visible object, or on the part of the visual power of the seer. On the part of the object, it may so happen because the object is received more perfectly in the seer, that is, according to the greater perfection of the similitude; but this does not apply to the present question, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is present to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> seeing Him not by way of similitude, but by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. It follows then that if one sees Him more perfectly than another, this happens according to the difference of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power; thus it follows too that the one whose <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power is higher, will see Him the more clearly; and this is incongruous; since equality with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as their beatitude.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> life consists in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a>: "This is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Thee the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," etc. Therefore if all saw the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> equally in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, all would be equal; the contrary to which is declared by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>: "Star differs from star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Of those who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one sees Him more perfectly than another. This, indeed, does not take place as if one had a more perfect similitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than another, since that vision will not spring from any similitude; but it will take place because one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will have a greater power or faculty to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than another. The faculty of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, but is given to it by the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which establishes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in a kind of "deiformity," as appears from what is said above, in the preceding article.

<p>Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which has more of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the more perfectly; and he will have a fuller participation of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> who has more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; because where there is the greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, there is the more desire; and desire in a certain degree makes the one desiring apt and prepared to receive the object desired. Hence he who possesses the more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the more perfectly, and will be the more beatified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the words,"We shall see Him as He is," the conjunction "as" determines the mode of vision on the part of the object seen, so that the meaning is, we shall see Him to be as He is, because we shall see His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But it does not determine the mode of vision on the part of the one seeing; as if the meaning was that the mode of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be as perfect as is the perfect mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Thus appears the answer to the Second Objection. For when it is said that one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not understand one and the same thing better than another, this would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if referred to the mode of the thing understood, for whoever understands it otherwise than it really is, does not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> understand it, but not if referred to the mode of understanding, for the understanding of one is more perfect than the understanding of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The diversity of seeing will not arise on the part of the object seen, for the same object will be presented to all--viz. the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor will it arise from the diverse participation of the object seen by different similitudes; but it will arise on the part of the diverse faculty of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty, but the glorified faculty.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether those who see the essence of God comprehend Him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that those who see the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians 3:12</a>): "But I follow after, if I may by any means comprehend [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'apprehend']." But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not follow in vain; for he said (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>): "I . . . so run, not as at an uncertainty." Therefore he comprehended; and in the same way, others also, whom he invites to do the same, saying: "So run that you may comprehend."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vid. Deum, Ep. cxlvii): "That is comprehended which is so seen as a whole, that nothing of it is hidden from the seer." But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, He is seen whole, and nothing of Him is hidden from the seer, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is simple. Therefore whoever sees His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, comprehends Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if we say that He is seen as a "whole," but not "wholly," it may be contrarily urged that "wholly" refers either to the mode of the seer, or to the mode of the thing seen. But he who sees the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sees Him wholly, if the mode of the thing seen is considered; forasmuch as he sees Him as He is; also, likewise, he sees Him wholly if the mode of the seer is meant, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> will with its full power see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore all who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> see Him wholly; therefore they comprehend Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "O most mighty, great, and powerful, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is Thy Name. Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought" (<a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse18">Jeremiah 32:18-19</a>). Therefore He cannot be comprehended.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is impossible for any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet "for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in some degree is great beatitude," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dim., Serm. xxxvii).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this we must consider that what is comprehended is perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and that is perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> so far as it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Thus, if anything which is capable of scientific demonstration is held only by an opinion resting on a probably <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, it is not comprehended; as, for instance, if anyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by scientific demonstration that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles, he comprehends that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; whereas if anyone accepts it as a probable opinion because wise men or most men teach it, he cannot be said to comprehend the thing itself, because he does not attain to that perfect mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which it is intrinsically capable. But no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can attain to that perfect mode of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereof it is intrinsically capable. Which thus appears--Everything is knowable according to its <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose being is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as was shown above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>) is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> knowable. Now no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> more or less perfectly in proportion as it receives a greater or lesser light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Since therefore the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> received into any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it is clearly impossible for any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degree. Hence it is impossible that it should comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Comprehension" is twofold: in one sense it is taken strictly and properly, according as something is included in the one comprehending; and thus in no way is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> comprehended either by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or in any other way; forasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and cannot be included in any finite being; so that no finite being can contain Him <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, in the degree of His own <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. In this sense we now take comprehension. But in another sense "comprehension" is taken more largely as opposed to "non-attainment"; for he who attains to anyone is said to comprehend him when he attains to him. And in this sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is comprehended by the blessed, according to the words, "I held him, and I will not let him go" (<a href="../bible/son003.htm#verse4">Canticles 3:4</a>); in this sense also are to be understood the words quoted from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> concerning comprehension. And in this way "comprehension" is one of the three prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, responding to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as vision responds to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and fruition responds to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For even among ourselves not everything seen is held or possessed, forasmuch as things either appear sometimes afar off, or they are not in our power of attainment. Neither, again, do we always enjoy what we possess; either because we find no pleasure in them, or because such things are not the ultimate end of our desire, so as to satisfy and quell it. But the blessed possess these three things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because they see Him, and in seeing Him, possess Him as present, having the power to see Him always; and possessing Him, they enjoy Him as the ultimate fulfilment of desire.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called incomprehensible not because anything of Him is not seen; but because He is not seen as perfectly as He is capable of being seen; thus when any demonstrable proposition is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by probable reason only, it does not follow that any part of it is unknown, either the subject, or the predicate, or the composition; but that it is not as perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as it is capable of being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in his definition of comprehension, says the whole is comprehended when it is seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer, or when its boundaries can be completely viewed or traced; for the boundaries of a thing are said to be completely surveyed when the end of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it is attained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The word "wholly" denotes a mode of the object; not that the whole object does not come under <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but that the mode of the object is not the mode of the one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Therefore he who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, sees in Him that He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> knowable; nevertheless, this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> mode does not extend to enable the knower to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>; thus, for instance, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can have a probable opinion that a proposition is demonstrable, although he himself does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it as demonstrated.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether those who see the essence of God see all in God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that those who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> see all things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dialog. iv): "What do they not see, who see Him Who sees all things?" But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things. Therefore those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> see all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever sees a mirror, sees what is reflected in the mirror. But all actual or possible things shine forth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in a mirror; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things in Himself. Therefore whoever sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sees all actual things in Him, and also all possible things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whoever understands the greater, can understand the least, as is said in De Anima iii. But all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, or can do, are less than His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore whoever understands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can understand all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, or can do.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the rational creature <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. Therefore if in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire will not rest satisfied; thus, in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it will not be fully <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; which is incongruous. Therefore he who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and yet do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. For as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii), "the inferior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are cleansed from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> by the superior <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Also they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of future contingent things, and of secret thoughts; for this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore whosoever sees the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in seeing the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, does not see in it all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does or can do. For it is manifest that things are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as they are in Him. But all other things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as effects are in the power of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore all things are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as an effect is seen in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now it is clear that the more perfectly a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is seen, the more of its effects can be seen in it. For whoever has a lofty understanding, as soon as one demonstrative principle is put before him can gather the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many conclusions; but this is beyond one of a weaker <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, for he needs things to be explained to him separately. And so an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the effects of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the reasons for those effects in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> itself, if it comprehends the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> wholly. Now no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wholly, as shown above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Therefore no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does or can do, for this would be to comprehend His power; but of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does or can do any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the more, the more perfectly it sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> speaks as regards the object being sufficient, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who in Himself sufficiently contains and shows forth all things; but it does not follow that whoever sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, for he does not perfectly comprehend Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that whoever sees a mirror should see all that is in the mirror, unless his glance comprehends the mirror itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although it is more to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than to see all things else, still it is a greater thing to see Him so that all things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Him, than to see Him in such a way that not all things, but the fewer or the more, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Him. For it has been shown in this article that the more things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according as He is seen more or less perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire of the rational creature is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything that belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and the genera of things and their types, and these everyone who sees the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> will see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> other singulars, their thoughts and their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> does not belong to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> nor does its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire go out to these things; neither, again, does it desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> not as yet, but which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can call into being. Yet if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone were seen, Who is the fount and principle of all being and of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He would so fill the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that nothing else would be desired, and the seer would be completely beatified. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. v): "Unhappy the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> all these" (i.e. all creatures) "and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not Thee! but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> whoso <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Thee although he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not these.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether what is seen in God by those who see the Divine essence, is seen through any similitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that what is seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by those who see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is seen by means of some similitude. For every kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes about by the knower being assimilated to the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For thus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act becomes the actual intelligible, and the sense in act becomes the actual sensible, inasmuch as it is informed by a similitude of the object, as the eye by the similitude of color. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of one who sees the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> understands any creatures in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must be informed by their similitudes.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what we have seen, we keep in <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, seeing the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whilst in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, when he had ceased to see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 28,34), remembered many of the things he had seen in the rapture; hence he said: "I have heard secret words which it is not granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to utter" (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>). Therefore it must be said that certain similitudes of what he remembered, remained in his mind; and in the same way, when he actually saw the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he had certain similitudes or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of what he actually saw in it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A mirror and what is in it are seen by means of one likeness. But all things are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in an intelligible mirror. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is not seen by any similitude but by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, neither are the things seen in Him seen by any similitudes or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Those who see the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> see what they see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not by any likeness, but by the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself united to their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For each thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in so far as its likeness is in the one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Now this takes place in two ways. For as things which are like one and the same thing are like to each other, the cognitive faculty can be assimilated to any knowable object in two ways. In one way it is assimilated by the object itself, when it is directly informed by a similitude, and then the object is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself. In another way when informed by a similitude which resembles the object; and in this way, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not of the thing in itself, but of the thing in its likeness. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a man in himself differs from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him in his image. Hence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things thus by their likeness in the one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them in themselves or in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; whereas to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by their similitudes pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is to see them in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now there is a difference between these two kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence, according to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by those who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself not by any other similitudes but by the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> alone present to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; by which also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is seen.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of one who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is assimilated to what is seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as it is united to the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in which the similitudes of all things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some of the cognitive faculties form other images from those first conceived; thus the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> from the preconceived images of a mountain and of gold can form the likeness of a golden mountain; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from the preconceived <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of genus and difference, forms the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; in like manner from the similitude of an image we can form in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> the similitude of the original of the image. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the very vision of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, can form in himself the similitudes of what is seen in the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which remained in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> even when he had ceased to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Still this kind of vision whereby things are seen by this likeness thus conceived, is not the same as that whereby things are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether those who see the essence of God see all they see in it at the same time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that those who see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not see all they see in Him at one and the same time. For according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. ii): "It may happen that many things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but only one is understood." But what is seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is understood; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not see all in Him at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 22,23), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature according to time"--i.e. by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and affection. But the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> creature is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore those who see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understand and are affected successively; for time means succession.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xvi): "Our thoughts will not be unstable, going to and fro from one thing to another; but we shall see all we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at one glance."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What is seen in the Word is seen not successively, but at the same time. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof, we ourselves cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many things all at once, forasmuch as understand many things by means of many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be actually informed by many diverse <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> at the same time, so as to understand by them; as one body cannot bear different shapes simultaneously. Hence, when many things can be understood by one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, they are understood at the same time; as the parts of a whole are understood successively, and not all at the same time, if each one is understood by its own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; whereas if all are understood under the one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the whole, they are understood simultaneously. Now it was shown above that things seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not seen singly by their own similitude; but all are seen by the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence they are seen simultaneously, and not successively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We understand one thing only when we understand by one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; but many things understood by one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> are understood simultaneously, as in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a man we understand "animal" and "rational"; and in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a house we understand the wall and the roof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As regards their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things by diverse <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> given them, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things simultaneously, and thus they are moved in the act of understanding according to time; but as regards what they see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they see all at the same time.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether anyone in this life can see the essence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that one can in this life see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: "I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face" (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis 32:30</a>). But to see Him face to face is to see His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as appears from the words: "We see now in a glass and in a dark manner, but then face to face" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: "I speak to him mouth to mouth, and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse8">Numbers 12:8</a>); but this is to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore it is possible to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that wherein we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all other things, and whereby we judge of other things, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself to us. But even now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii): "If we both see that what you say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and we both see that what I say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; where, I ask, do we see this? neither I in thee, nor thou in me; but both of us in the very incommutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself above our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>." He also says (De Vera Relig. xxx) that, "We judge of all things according to the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and (De Trin. xii) that, "it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of reason to judge of these corporeal things according to the incorporeal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; which unless they were above the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> could not be incommutable." Therefore even in this life we see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24, 25), those things that are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are seen by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision. But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is of intelligible things, not by similitudes, but by their very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>, as he also says (Gen. ad lit. xiii, 24,25). Therefore since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it follows that He is seen by us in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, "Man shall not see Me, and live" (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse20">Exodus 32:20</a>), and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> upon this says, "In this mortal life <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen by certain images, but not by the likeness itself of His own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be seen in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> by a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a>, except he be separated from this mortal life. The reason is because, as was said above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> follows the mode of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the knower. But our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as long as we live in this life, has its being in corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only what has a form in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, or what can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by such a form. Now it is evident that the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of material things. For it was shown above (Question 2, Article 9) that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by means of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> similitude is not the vision of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence it is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this life to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This can be seen in the fact that the more our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is abstracted from corporeal things, the more it is capable of receiving abstract intelligible things. Hence in dreams and alienations of the bodily senses divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> and foresight of future events are perceived the more clearly. It is not possible, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in this mortal life should be raised up to the supreme of intelligible objects, i.e. to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iv) a man is said in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sense that certain figures are formed in the senses or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, according to some similitude representing in part the divinity. So when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> says, "I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face," this does not mean the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but some figure representing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is to be referred to some high mode of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seems to speak, though in an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision; as will later be explained (II-II, 174) in treating of the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. We may also say that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> spoke thus to designate some exalted <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, above the ordinary state.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in corporeal things, so also He does <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> wonders above the common order, raising the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of some living in the flesh beyond the use of sense, even up to the vision of His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 26,27,28) of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. This will be treated more fully in the question of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> (II-II, 175).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All things are said to be seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all things are judged in Him, because by the participation of His light, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and judge all things; for the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> itself is a participation of the divine light; as likewise we are said to see and judge of sensible things in the sun, i.e., by the sun's light. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 8), "The lessons of instruction can only be seen as it were by their own sun," namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As therefore in order to see a sensible object, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to see the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the sun, so in like manner to see any intelligible object, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> vision is of the things which are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as intelligible things are in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed; not thus is He in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but by presence, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and power.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life. For <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Consol. v) that "reason does not grasp simple form." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a supremely simple form, as was shown above (Question 3, Article 7). Therefore <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot attain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands nothing by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without the use of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But we cannot have an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is incorporeal. Therefore we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> belongs to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, inasmuch as they have a common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belongs only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i): "The weak eye of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is not fixed on that excellent light unless purified by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19</a>), "That which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," namely, what can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, "is manifest in them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begins from sense. Hence our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can go as far as it can be led by sensible things. But our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> cannot be led by sense so far as to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because the sensible effects of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not equal the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things the whole power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; nor therefore can His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be seen. But because they are His effects and depend on their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, we can be led from them so far as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "whether He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>," and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of Him what must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> belong to Him, as the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, exceeding all things <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by Him.

<p>Hence we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that His relationship with creatures so far as to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of them all; also that creatures differ from Him, inasmuch as He is not in any way part of what is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by Him; and that creatures are not removed from Him by reason of any defect on His part, but because He superexceeds them all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> cannot reach up to simple form, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "what it is"; but it can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "whether it is."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the images of His effects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it belongs only to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can belong to both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad; and hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i), retracting what he had said before: "I do not approve what I said in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who willest that only the pure should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.' For it can be answered that many who are not pure can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>," i.e. by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether by grace a higher knowledge of God can be obtained than by natural reason?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a higher <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not obtained than by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (De Mystica Theol. i) that whoever is the more united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, is united to Him as to one entirely unknown. He says the same of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who nevertheless obtained a certain excellence by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> while ignoring of Him "what He is," comes about also by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, we can acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> only through the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>; and the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it is impossible for the divine ray to shine upon us except as screened round about by the many colored sacred veils." Therefore we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more fully by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xxvi in Ev.) that "things not seen are the objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore there is not given to us a more excellent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath revealed to us His spirit," what "none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>), namely, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We have a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which we have by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> contains two things: images derived from the sensible objects; and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> intelligible light, enabling us to abstract from them intelligible conceptions.

<p>Now in both of these, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is assisted by the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light is strengthened by the infusion of gratuitous light; and sometimes also the images in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> are divinely formed, so as to express divine things better than those do which we receive from sensible objects, as appears in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> visions; while sometimes sensible things, or even voices, are divinely formed to express some divine meaning; as in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was seen in the shape of a dove, and the voice of the Father was heard, "This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew 3:17</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although by the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in this life we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "what He is," and thus are united to Him as to one unknown; still we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him more fully according as many and more excellent of His effects are demonstrated to us, and according as we attribute to Him some things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot reach, as, for instance, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Three and One</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the images either received from sense in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, or divinely formed in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, we have so much the more excellent <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the stronger the intelligible light is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and thus through the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> given by the images a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is received by the infusion of the divine light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is determined by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to some knowable object. But this determination to one object does not proceed from the vision of the believer, but from the vision of Him who is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Thus as far as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> falls short of vision, it falls short of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which belongs to science, for science determines the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to one object by the vision and understanding of first principles.
