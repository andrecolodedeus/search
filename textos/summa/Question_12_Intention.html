<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether intention is an act of the intellect or of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and not of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse22">Matthew 6:22</a>): "If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome": where, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 13) the eye signifies <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. But since the eye is the organ of sight, it signifies the apprehensive power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not an act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> but of the apprehensive power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 13) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> spoke of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as a light, when He said (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew 6:23</a>): "If the light that is in thee be darkness," etc. But light pertains to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> does too.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> implies a kind of ordaining to an end. But to ordain is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but to the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is either of the end or of the means. But the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in respect of the end is called volition, or enjoyment; with regard to the means, it is choice, from which <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is distinct. Therefore it is not an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xi, 4,8,9) that "the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> unites the sight to the object seen; and the images retained in the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, to the penetrating gaze of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> inner thought." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Intention, as the very word denotes, signifies, "to tend to something." Now both the action of the mover and the movement of thing moved, tend to something. But that the movement of the thing moved tends to anything, is due to the action of the mover. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> belongs first and principally to that which moves to the end: hence we say that an architect or anyone who is in authority, by his command moves others to that which he intends. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves all the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the end, as shown above (Question 9, Article 1). Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, properly speaking, is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The eye designates <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> figuratively, not because <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> has reference to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but because it presupposes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which proposes to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> the end to which the latter moves; thus we foresee with the eye whither we should tend with our bodies.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Intention is called a light because it is manifest to him who intends. Wherefore works are called darkness because a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he intends, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what the result may be, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounds (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 13).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The will does not ordain, but tends to something according to the order of reason. Consequently this word "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" indicates an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, presupposing the act whereby the reason orders something to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Intention is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in regard to the end. Now the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> stands in a threefold relation to the end. First, absolutely; and thus we have "volition," whereby we will absolutely to have health, and so forth. Secondly, it considers the end, as its place of rest; and thus "enjoyment" regards the end. Thirdly, it considers the end as the term towards which something is ordained; and thus "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>" regards the end. For when we speak of intending to have health, we mean not only that we have it, but that we will have it by means of something else.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether intention is only of the last end?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is only of the last end. For it is said in the book of Prosper's Sentences (Sent. 100): "The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the heart is a cry to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the last end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is always regards the last end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> regards the end as the terminus, as stated above (01, ad 4). But a terminus is something last. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> always regards the last end.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> regards the end, so does enjoyment. But enjoyment is always of the last end. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is too.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There is but one last end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wills, viz. Happiness, as stated above (Question 1, Article 7). If, therefore, intentions were only of the last end, men would not have different intentions: which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (01, ad 4), <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> regards the end as a terminus of the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now a terminus of movement may be taken in two ways. First, the very last terminus, when the movement comes to a stop; this is the terminus of the whole movement. Secondly, some point midway, which is the beginning of one part of the movement, and the end or terminus of the other. Thus in the movement from A to C through B, C is the last terminus, while B is a terminus, but not the last. And <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> can be both. Consequently though <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is always of the end, it need not be always of the last end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the heart is called a cry to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is always the object of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, but because He sees our intention. Or because, when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, we direct our <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> has the force of a cry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A terminus is something last, not always in respect of the whole, but sometimes in respect of a part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Enjoyment implies rest in the end; and this belongs to the last end alone. But <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> implies movement towards an end, not rest. Wherefore the comparison proves nothing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one can intend two things at the same time?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one cannot intend several things at the same time. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 14,16,17) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> cannot be directed at the same time to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to bodily benefits. Therefore, for the same reason, neither to any other two things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> designates a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards a terminus. Now there cannot be several termini in the same direction of one movement. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot intend several things at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> presupposes an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But "it is not possible to understand several things at the same time," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. ii, 10). Therefore neither is it possible to intend several things at the same time.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Art imitates <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends two purposes by means of one instrument: thus "the tongue is for the purpose of taste and speech" (De Anima ii, 8). Therefore, for the same reason, art or reason can at the same time direct one thing to two ends: so that one can intend several ends at the same time.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The expression "two things" may be taken in two ways: they may be ordained to one another or not so ordained. And if they be ordained to one another, it is evident, from what has been said, that a man can intend several things at the same time. For <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is not only of the last end, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), but also of an intermediary end. Now a man intends at the same time, both the proximate and the last end; as the mixing of a medicine and the giving of health.

<p>But if we take two things that are not ordained to one another, thus also a man can intend several things at the same time. This is evident from the fact that a man prefers one thing to another because it is the better of the two. Now one of the reasons for which one thing is better than another is that it is available for more purposes: wherefore one thing can be chosen in preference to another, because of the greater number of purposes for which it is available: so that evidently a man can intend several things at the same time.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means to say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot at the same time direct his attention to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to bodily benefits, as to two last ends: since, as stated above (Question 1, Article 5), one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot have several last ends.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There can be several termini ordained to one another, of the same movement and in the same direction; but not unless they be ordained to one another. At the same time it must be observed that what is not one in reality may be taken as one by the reason. Now <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to something already ordained by the reason, as stated above (01, ad 3). Wherefore where we have many things in reality, we may take them as one term of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, in so far as the reason takes them as one: either because two things concur in the integrity of one whole, as a proper measure of heat and cold conduce to health; or because two things are included in one which may be intended. For instance, the acquiring of wine and clothing is included in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as in something common to both; wherefore nothing hinders the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who intends to acquire <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, from intending both the others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in the I, 12, 10; I, 58, 2; I, 85, 4 it is possible to understand several things at the same time, in so far as, in some way, they are one.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether intention of the end is the same act as the volition of the means?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end and the volition of the means are not one and the same movement. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xi, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to see the window, has for its end the seeing of the window; and is another act from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to see, through the window, the passersby." But that I should will to see the passersby, through the window, belongs to <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; whereas that I will to see the window, belongs to the volition of the means. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end and the willing of the means are distinct movements of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, acts are distinct according to their objects. But the end and the means are distinct objects. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end and the willing of the means are distinct movements of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the willing of the means is called choice. But choice and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> are not the same. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end and the willing of the means are not the same movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The means in relation to the end, are as the mid-space to the terminus. Now it is all the same movement that passes through the mid-space to the terminus, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Therefore in things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end is the same movement as the willing of the means.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the end and to the means can be considered in two ways. First, according as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to each of the aforesaid absolutely and in itself. And thus there are really two movements of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to them. Secondly, it may be considered accordingly as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to the means for the sake of the end: and thus the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the end and its movement to the means are one and the same thing. For when I say: "I wish to take medicine for the sake of health," I signify no more than one movement of my will. And this is because the end is the reason for willing the means. Now the object, and that by reason of which it is an object, come under the same act; thus it is the same act of sight that perceives color and light, as stated above (8, 3, ad 2). And the same applies to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for if it consider principle and conclusion absolutely, it considers each by a distinct act; but when it assents to the conclusion on account of the principles, there is but one act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of seeing the window and of seeing, through the window, the passersby, according as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is moved to either absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The end, considered as a thing, and the means to that end, are distinct objects of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But in so far as the end is the formal object in willing the means, they are one and the same object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A movement which is one as to the subject, may differ, according to our way of looking at it, as to its beginning and end, as in the case of ascent and descent (Phys. iii, 3). Accordingly, in so far as the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is to the means, as ordained to the end, it is called "choice": but the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to the end as acquired by the means, it is called "<a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>." A sign of this is that we can have <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the end without having determined the means which are the object of choice.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether intention is within the competency of irrational animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that irrational animals intend the end. For in things void of reason <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stands further apart from the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, than does the sensitive <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in irrational animals. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> intends the end even in things void of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. ii, 8. Much more, therefore, do irrational animals intend the end.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is of the end, so is enjoyment. But enjoyment is in irrational animals, as stated above (Question 11, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is too.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to intend an end belongs to one who acts for an end; since to intend is nothing else than to tend to something. But irrational animals act for an end; for an animal is moved either to seek food, or to do something of the kind. Therefore irrational animals intend an end.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Intention of an end implies ordaining something to an end: which belongs to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Since therefore irrational animals are void of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it seems that they do not intend an end.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), to intend is to tend to something; and this belongs to the mover and to the moved. According, therefore, as that which is moved to an end by another is said to intend the end, thus <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is said to intend an end, as being moved to its end by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the arrow is moved by the archer. And in this way, irrational animals intend an end, inasmuch as they are moved to something by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. The other way of intending an end belongs to the mover; according as he ordains the movement of something, either his own or another's, to an end. This belongs to reason alone. Wherefore irrational animals do not intend an end in this way, which is to intend properly and principally, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in the sense of being moved to an end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Enjoyment does not imply the ordaining of one thing to another, as <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> does, but absolute repose in the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Irrational animals are moved to an end, not as though they thought that they can gain the end by this movement; this belongs to one that intends; but through desiring the end by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, they are moved to an end, moved, as it were, by another, like other things that are moved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.
