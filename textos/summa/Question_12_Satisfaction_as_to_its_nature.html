<h1>Question 12. Satisfaction, as to its nature</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5012.htm#article1"> Is satisfaction a virtue or an act of virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5012.htm#article2"> Is it an act of justice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5012.htm#article3"> Is the definition of satisfaction contained in the text suitable?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether satisfaction is a virtue or an act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that satisfaction is neither a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> nor an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>; whereas, seemingly, satisfaction is not, since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is gratuitous, while satisfaction answers to a debt. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. But sometimes a man has to make satisfaction for something against his will, as when anyone is punished by the judge for an offense against another. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 13): "Choice holds the chief place in moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." But satisfaction is not an act of choice but regards chiefly external works. Therefore it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Satisfaction belongs to penance. Now penance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore satisfaction is also an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Further, none but an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has the effect of blotting out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for one contrary is destroyed by the other. Now satisfaction destroys <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> altogether. Therefore it is an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An act is said to be the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. First, materially; and thus any act which implies no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, or defect of a due circumstance, may be called an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can make use of any such act for its end, e.g. to walk, to speak, and so forth. Secondly, an act is said to belong to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> formally, because its very name implies the form and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; thus to suffer <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> is an act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. Now the formal element in every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the observance of a mean. wherefore every act that implies the observance of a mean is formally an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And since equality is the mean implied in the name of satisfaction (for a thing is said to be satisfied by reason of an equal proportion to something), it is evident that satisfaction also is formally an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although to make satisfaction is due in itself, yet, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is done <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> by the one who offers satisfaction, it becomes something gratuitous on the part of the agent, so that he makes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For debt diminishes <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> through being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and consequently against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so that if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> consent to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, the element of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is not forfeited.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> An act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> demands voluntariness not in the patient but in the agent, for it is his act. Consequently since he on whom the judge wreaks vengeance is the patient and not the agent as regards satisfaction, it follows that satisfaction should be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> not in him but in the judge as agent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The chief element of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be understood in two ways. First, as being the chief element of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus the chief element of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> denotes whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or is most akin thereto; thus choice and other internal acts hold the chief place in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, the chief element of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be taken as denoting that which holds the first place in such and such a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and then the first place belongs to that which gives its determination. Now the interior act, in certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, is determined by some external act, since choice, which is common to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, becomes proper to such and such a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through being directed to such and such an act. Thus it is that external acts hold the chief place in certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and this is the case with satisfaction.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether satisfaction is an act of justice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that satisfaction is not an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Because the purpose of satisfaction is that one may be reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> offended. But reconciliation, being an act of love, belongs to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore satisfaction is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in us are the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which incline us to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 2,3), is not about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but about operations. Since therefore satisfaction aims at removing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15), it seems that it is not an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to be careful about the future is not an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of which caution is a part. But it belongs to satisfaction, "to give no opening to the suggestions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" [Cf. Supplement 12, 3, Objection 1. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considers the notion of that which is due. But satisfaction gives due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> states (Cur Deus Homo i). Therefore satisfaction is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> save <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> establishes equality between external things. But this is done by satisfaction which establishes equality between amendment and the previous offense. Therefore satisfaction is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 3,4), the mean of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is considered with regard to an equation between thing and thing according to a certain proportion. Wherefore, since the very name of satisfaction implies an equation of the kind, because the adverb "satis" [enough] denotes an equality of proportion, it is evident that satisfaction is formally an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 2,4), is either an act done by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another, as when a man pays another what he owes him, or an act done by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> between two others, as when a judge does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between two men. When it is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another, the equality is set up in the agent, while when it is something done between two others, the equality is set up in the subject that has suffered an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. And since satisfaction expresses equality in the agent, it denotes, properly speaking, an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another. Now a man may do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to another either in actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> or in external things; even as one may do an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to another, either by taking something away, or by a hurtful action. And since to give is to use an external thing, the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in so far as it establishes equality between external things, signifies, properly speaking, a giving back: but to make satisfaction clearly points to equality between actions, although sometimes one is put for the other. Now equalization concerns only such things as are unequal, wherefore satisfaction presupposes inequality among actions, which inequality constitutes an offense; so that satisfaction regards a previous offense. But no part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards a previous offense, except vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which establishes equality indifferently, whether the patient be the same subject as the agent, as when anyone punishes himself, or whether they be distinct, as when a judge punishes another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> deals with both cases. The same applies to penance, which implies equality in the agent only, since it is the penitent who holds to the penance [poenam tenet], so that penance is in a way a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. This proves that satisfaction, which implies equality in the agent with respect to a previous offense, is a work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as to that part which is called penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Satisfaction, as appears from what has been said, is compensation for injury inflicted. Wherefore as the injury inflicted entailed of itself an inequality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and consequently an inequality opposed to friendship, so satisfaction brings back directly equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and consequently equality of friendship. And since an act is elicited by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to whose end it is immediately directed, but is commanded by that <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to whose end it is directed ultimately, hence satisfaction is elicited by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but is commanded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is chiefly about operations, yet it is consequently about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in so far as they are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of operations. Wherefore as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> curbs <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, lest it inflict an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> injury on another, and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> from invading another's marriage right, so satisfaction removes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Each moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> shares in the act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> completes in it the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since each moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> takes its mean according to the ruling of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as is evident from the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> given in Ethic. ii, 6.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the definition of satisfaction given in the text is suitable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the definition of satisfaction given in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15) and quoted from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [<a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius Massiliensis</a>, De Eccl. Dogm. liv] is unsuitable--viz. that "satisfaction is to uproot the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to give no opening to the suggestions thereof." For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the fomes. ["Fomes" signifies literally "fuel," and metaphorically, "incentive." As used by the theologian, it denotes the quasi-material element and effect of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and sometimes goes under the name of "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>." [Cf. I-II, 82, 3]. But we cannot remove the "fomes" in this life. Therefore satisfaction does not consist in removing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is stronger than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by himself cannot remove <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Much less therefore can he remove the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so the same conclusion follows.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, since satisfaction is a part of Penance, it regards the past and not the future. Now "to give no opening to the suggestions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" regards the future. Therefore it should not be put in the definition of satisfaction.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, satisfaction regards a past offense. Yet no mention is made of this. Therefore the definition of satisfaction is unsuitable.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> gives another definition (Cur Deus homo i): "Satisfaction consists in giving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>," wherein no reference is made to the things mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Gennadius, Objection 1 in this definition. Therefore one or the other is unsuitable.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, an innocent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can give due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas satisfaction is not compatible with innocence. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm's</a> definition is faulty.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Justice aims not only at removing inequality already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>, by punishing the past fault, but also at safeguarding equality for the future, because according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 3) "punishments are medicinal." Wherefore satisfaction which is the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> inflicting punishment, is a medicine healing past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and preserving from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: so that when one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes satisfaction to another, he offers compensation for the past, and takes heed for the future. Accordingly satisfaction may be defined in two ways, first with regard to past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which it heals by making compensation, and thus it is defined as "compensation for an inflicted injury according to the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." The definition of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> amounts to the same, for he says that "satisfaction consists in giving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>"; where <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is considered in respect of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. Secondly, satisfaction may be defined, considered as preserving us from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Cf. Objection 1) defines it. Now preservation from bodily sickness is assured by removing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> from which the sickness may ensue, for if they be taken away the sickness cannot follow. But it is not thus in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> diseases, for the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> cannot be forced, so that even in the presence of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, they can, though with difficulty, be avoided, while they can be incurred even when their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are removed. Hence he puts two things in the definition of satisfaction, viz. removal of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as to the first, and the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will's</a> refusal to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By "<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>" we must understand the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which are twofold: viz. the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or act of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that has been given up, and those things which are called the remnants of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and external occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, such as place, bad company and so forth. Such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are removed by satisfaction in this life, albeit the "fomes," which is the remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not entirely removed by satisfaction in this life though it is weakened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or of privation (according as it has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>) is nothing else than a defective <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and since it is easier to destroy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than to set it up, it follows that it is easier to uproot the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of privation and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than to remove the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> itself, which can only be removed by setting up <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as may be seen in the case of blindness and its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Yet the aforesaid are not sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, ensue therefrom, but they are occasions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor again can satisfaction be made without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, since it is not possible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as we shall state further on (14, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although Penance was primarily instituted and intended with a view to the past, yet, as a consequence, it regards the future, in so far as it is a safeguarding remedy; and the same applies to satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [<a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius Massiliensis</a>, De Eccl. Dogm. liv] defined satisfaction, as made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom, in reality, nothing can be taken, though the sinner, for his own part, takes something away. Consequently in such like satisfaction, amendment for future time is of greater weight than compensation for the past. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> defines satisfaction from this point of view. And yet it is possible to gauge the compensation for the past from the heed taken for the future, for the latter regards the same object as the former, but in the opposite way: since when looking at the past we detest the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> themselves, which are the starting-point of the movement of detestation: whereas when taking heed of the future, we begin from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, that by their removal we may avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the more easily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> There is no reason why the same thing should not be described in different ways according to the various things found in it: and such is the case here, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> By debt is meant the debt we owe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we have committed, because Penance regards a debt, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).
