<h1>Question 12. The acquired or empiric knowledge of Christ's soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4012.htm#article1"> Did Christ know all things by this knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4012.htm#article2"> Did He advance in this knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4012.htm#article3"> Did He learn anything from man?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4012.htm#article4"> Did He receive anything from angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ knew all things by this acquired or empiric knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> everything by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is acquired by experience. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not experience everything. Therefore He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> everything by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the senses. But not all sensible things were subjected to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily senses. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> everything by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the extent of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> depends on the things knowable. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all things by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, His acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> would have been equal to His infused and <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a>; which is not fitting. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing imperfect was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of His would have been imperfect if He had not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> all things by it, since the imperfect is that to which addition may be made. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all things by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is held to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we have said (9, 4), by reason of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, lest its action, which is to make things actually intelligible, should be wanting; even as imprinted or infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> is held to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the perfection of the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now as the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that by which "all things are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>," so the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that by which "all are in act," as is said De Anima iii, 18. And hence, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> by infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> all things to which the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in any way in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, so by acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> whatever can be <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> by the action of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things may be acquired not merely by experiencing the things themselves, but by experiencing other things; since by virtue of the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can go on to understand effects from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> from effects, like from like, contrary from contrary. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though He did not experience all things, came to the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things from what He did experience.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although all sensible things were not subjected to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> bodily senses, yet other sensible things were subjected to His senses; and from this He could come to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> other things by the most excellent force of His reason, in the manner described in the previous reply; just as in seeing heavenly bodies He could comprehend their powers and the effects they have upon things here below, which were not subjected to His senses; and for the same reason, from any other things whatsoever, He could come to the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of yet other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things simply, but all such as are knowable by the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, nor past, present, or future singulars, which, nevertheless, He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> by infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as was said above (<a href="#11">Article 11</a>).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ advanced in acquired or empiric knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not advance in this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. For even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all things by His beatific and His infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, so also did He by this acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as is plain from what has been said (1). But He did not advance in these <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledges</a>. Therefore neither in this.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to advance belongs to the imperfect, since the perfect cannot be added to. Now we cannot suppose an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not advance in this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 22): "Whoever say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> advanced in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as if receiving additional sensations, do not venerate the union which is in hypostasis." But it is impious not to venerate this union. Therefore it is impious to say that His <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> received increase.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke 2:52</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> advanced in wisdom and age and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men"; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Incar. Dom. vii) that "He advanced in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom is that which is acquired in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> manner, i.e. by the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> advanced in this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold advancement in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is increased; the other in effect--e.g. if someone were with one and the same <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> to someone else some minor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> at first, and afterwards greater and more subtle conclusions. Now in this second way it is plain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> advanced in <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as in age, since as His age increased He wrought greater <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and showed greater <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p>But as regards the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is plain that His <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> did not increase, since from the beginning He had perfect infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things; and still less could His <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific knowledge</a> increase; while in I, 14, 15, we have already said that His Divine <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> could not increase. Therefore, if in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, beyond the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as appears to some [Blessed Albert the Great, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, St. Bonaventure, and sometime appeared to me (Sent. iii, D, xiv), no <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> increased in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but merely by experience, i.e. by comparing the infused intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> with phantasms. And in this way they maintain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> grew in experience, e.g. by comparing the infused intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> with what He received through the senses for the first time. But because it seems unfitting that any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> intelligible action should be wanting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and because to extract intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from phantasms is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it seems becoming to place even this action in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And it follows from this that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> which could increase by this abstraction of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; inasmuch as the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, after abstracting the first intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from phantasms, could abstract others, and others again.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Both the infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and the beatific <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were the effects of an agent of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, which could produce the whole at once; and thus in neither <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> advance; since from the beginning He had them perfectly. But the acquired <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which does not produce the whole at once, but successively; and hence by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> everything from the beginning, but step by step, and after a time, i.e. in His perfect age; and this is plain from what the Evangelist says, viz. that He increased in "<a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and age" together.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was always perfect for the time being, although it was not always perfect, simply and in comparison to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; hence it could increase.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> regards those who say absolutely that addition was made to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. as regards any <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of His, and especially as regards the infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> which is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by union with the Word; but it does not regard the increase of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ learned anything from man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> learned something from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse46">Luke 2:46-47</a>) that, "They found Him in the temple in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, hearing them, and asking them questions." But to ask questions and to reply pertains to a learner. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> learned something from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from a man's teaching seems more noble than to acquire it from sensible things, since in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who teaches the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are in act; but in sensible things the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> from sensible things, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Much more, therefore, could He receive <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> by learning from men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> everything from the beginning, but advanced in it, as was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But anyone hearing words which mean something, may learn something he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could learn from men something He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> by this <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa045.htm#verse4">Psalm 45:4</a>): "Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>." Now a master is not taught, but teaches. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not receive any <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> by the teaching of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every genus that which is the first mover is not moved according to the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of movement; just as the first alterative is not itself altered. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>--yea, of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as was said above (Question 8, Article 3), so that not only all might receive <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through Him, but that all might receive the doctrine of Truth from Him. Hence He Himself says (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse37">John 18:37</a>): "For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." And thus it did not befit His dignity that He should be taught by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. xix in Luc.): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> asked questions not in order to learn anything, but in order to teach by questioning. For from the same well of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> came the question and the wise reply." Hence the Gospel goes on to say that "all that heard Him were astonished at His wisdom and His answers."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whoever learns from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> immediately from the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> which are in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but through sensible words, which are signs of intelligible concepts. Now as words formed by a man are signs of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; so are creatures, formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, signs of His wisdom. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse10">Sirach 1:10</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "poured" wisdom "out upon all His works." Hence, just as it is better to be taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so it is better to receive our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from sensible creatures and not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> teaching.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> advanced in empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as in age, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now as a fitting age is required for a man to acquire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by discovery, so also that he may acquire it by being taught. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> did nothing unbecoming to His age; and hence He did not give ear to hearing the lessons of doctrine until such time as He was able to have reached that grade of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> by way of experience. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Sup. Ezech. Lib. i, Hom. ii): "In the twelfth year of His age He deigned to question men on earth, since in the course of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the word of doctrine is not vouchsafed before the age of perfection."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ received knowledge from the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke 22:43</a>) that "there appeared to Him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, strengthening Him." But we are strengthened by the comforting words of a teacher, according to <a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse3">Job 4:3-4</a>: "Behold thou hast taught many and hast strengthened the weary hand. Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was taught by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv): "For I see that even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>--the super-<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of supercelestial <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>--when without change He took our <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> upon Himself, was subject in obedience to the instructions of the Father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Hence it seems that even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wished to be subject to the ordinations of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, whereby men are taught by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is subject to the celestial bodies, so likewise is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> minds. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was subject to the impressions of the heavenly bodies, for He felt the heat in summer and the cold in winter, and other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind was subject to the illuminations of supercelestial spirits.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii) that "the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> question <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and learn the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of His Divine work, and of the flesh assumed for us; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> teaches them directly." Now to teach and to be taught do not belong to the same. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is midway between <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> and corporeal things, it is perfected <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in two ways. First by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> received from sensible things; secondly, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> imprinted or infused by the illumination of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. Now in both these ways the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was perfected; first by empirical <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things, for which there is no need of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> light, since the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> suffices; secondly, by the higher impression of infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, which He received directly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was united to the Word above the common mode, in unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so above the common manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> was it filled with <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself; and not by the medium of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who in their beginning received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things by the influence of the Word, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This strengthening by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was for the purpose not of instructing Him, but of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says (on <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke 22:43</a>): "In testimony of both natures are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said to have ministered to Him and to have strengthened Him. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> did not need help from His creature; but having become <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even as it was for our sake that He was sad, so was it for our sake that He was strengthened," i.e. in order that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> might be strengthened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was subject to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> instructions, not by reason of Himself, but by reason of what happened at His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and as regards the care of Him whilst He was a child. Hence in the same place he adds that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> withdrawal to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> decreed by the Father is announced to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and again His return to Judaea from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed a passible body (as will be said hereafter (14, 1) and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perfect in <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (14, 1, ad 1; 4). Hence His body was rightly subject to the impression of heavenly bodies; but His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not subject to the impression of heavenly spirits.
