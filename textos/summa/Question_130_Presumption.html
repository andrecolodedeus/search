<h1>Question 130. Presumption</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3130.htm#article1"> Is presumption a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3130.htm#article2"> Is it opposed to magnanimity by excess?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether presumption is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Forgetting the things that are behind, I stretch forth [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'and stretching forth'] myself to those that are before." But it seems to savor of presumption that one should tend to what is above oneself. Therefore presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 7) "we should not listen to those who would persuade us to relish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things because we are men, or mortal things because we are mortal, but we should relish those that make us <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>": and (Metaph. i) "that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should pursue divine things as far as possible." Now divine and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> things are seemingly far above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Since then presumption consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in tending to what is above oneself, it seems that presumption is something praiseworthy, rather than a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>): "Not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves, as of ourselves." If then presumption, by which one strives at that for which one is not sufficient, be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot lawfully even think of anything <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: which is absurd. Therefore presumption is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir037.htm#verse3">Sirach 37:3</a>): "O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> presumption, whence camest thou?" and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> answers: "From a creature's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will." Now all that comes of the root of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore presumption is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since whatever is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is ordered by the Divine <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> ought to imitate, whatever is done in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in opposition to the order established in general throughout <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now it is established throughout all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, that every action is commensurate with the power of the agent, nor does any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> agent strive to do what exceeds its ability. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as being contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order, that any one should assume to do what is above his power: and this is what is meant by presumption, as its very name shows. Wherefore it is evident that presumption is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing hinders that which is above the active power of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> thing, and yet not above the passive power of that same thing: thus the air is possessed of a passive power by reason of which it can be so changed as to obtain the action and movement of fire, which surpass the active power of air. Thus too it would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and presumptuous for a man while in a state of imperfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to attempt the immediate accomplishment of what belongs to perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it is not presumptuous or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> for a man to endeavor to advance towards perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> stretched himself forth to the things that were before him, namely continually advancing forward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Divine and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> things surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is possessed of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whereby he can be united to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and Divine things. On this respect the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to pursue <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and divine things," not that he should do what it becomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do, but that he should be united to Him in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 3), "what we can do by the help of others we can do by ourselves in a sense." Hence since we can think and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this is not altogether above our ability. Hence it is not presumptuous for a man to attempt the accomplishment of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: but it would be presumptuous if one were to make the attempt without confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that presumption is not opposed to magnanimity by excess. For presumption is accounted a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (14, 2; 21, 1). But the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not opposed to magnanimity, but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Neither therefore is presumption opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it belongs to magnanimity that one should deem oneself worthy of great things. But a man is said to be presumptuous even if he deem himself worthy of small things, if they surpass his ability. Therefore presumption is not directly opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> looks upon external goods as little things. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3), "on account of external fortune the presumptuous disdain and wrong others, because they deem external goods as something great." Therefore presumption is opposed to magnanimity, not by excess, but only by deficiency.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 3) that the "vain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," i.e. a vaporer or a wind-bag, which with us denotes a presumptuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "is opposed to the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by excess."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (129, 3, ad 1), magnanimity observes the means, not as regards the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of that to which it tends, but in proportion to our own ability: for it does not tend to anything greater than is becoming to us.

<p>Now the presumptuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as regards that to which he tends, does not exceed the magnanimous, but sometimes falls far short of him: but he does exceed in proportion to his own ability, whereas the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not exceed his. It is in this way that presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not every presumption that is accounted a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but that by which one contemns the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> through inordinate confidence in the Divine mercy. The latter kind of presumption, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, inasmuch, to wit, as it implies contempt of something Divine, is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or rather to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear, whereby we revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless, in so far as this contempt exceeds the proportion to one's own ability, it can be opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Presumption, like magnanimity, seems to tend to something great. For we are not, as a rule, wont to call a man presumptuous for going beyond his powers in something small. If, however, such a man be called presumptuous, this kind of presumption is not opposed to magnanimity, but to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is about ordinary <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as stated above (Question 129, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> No one attempts what is above his ability, except in so far as he deems his ability greater than it is. On this one may <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in two ways. First only as regards <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as when a man thinks he has greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or the like, than he has. Secondly, as regards the kind of thing, as when he thinks himself great, and worthy of great things, by reason of something that does not make him so, for instance by reason of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> or goods of fortune. For, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3), "those who have these things without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> deem themselves worthy of great things, nor are rightly called magnanimous."

<p>Again, the thing to which a man sometimes tends in excess of his ability, is sometimes in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> something great, simply as in the case of Peter, whose intent was to suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which has exceeded his power; while sometimes it is something great, not simply, but only in the opinion of fools, such as wearing costly clothes, despising and wronging others. This savors of an excess of magnanimity, not in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but in people's opinion. Hence Seneca says (De Quat. Virtut.) that "when magnanimity exceeds its measure, it makes a man high-handed, proud, haughty restless, and bent on excelling in all things, whether in words or in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, without any considerations of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Thus it is evident that the presumptuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes falls short of the magnanimous in reality, although in appearance he surpasses him.
