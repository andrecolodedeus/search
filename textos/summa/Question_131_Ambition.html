<h1>Question 131. Ambition</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3131.htm#article1"> Is it a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3131.htm#article2"> Is it opposed to magnanimity by excess?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether ambition is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that ambition is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For ambition denotes the desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is in itself a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing, and the greatest of external goods: wherefore those who care not for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are reproved. Therefore ambition is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; rather is it something deserving of praise, in so far as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is laudably desired.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, anyone may, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, desire what is due to him as a reward. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. i, 12; iv, 3; viii, 14). Therefore ambition of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which heartens a man to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and disheartens him from doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> heartens men to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "with the bravest men, cowards are held in dishonor, and the brave in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>": and Tully says (De Tusc. Quaest. i) that "<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> fosters the arts." Therefore ambition is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is not ambitious, seeketh not her own." Now nothing is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, except <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore ambition is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (103, 1 and 2), <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> denotes reverence shown to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in witness of his excellence. Now two things have to be considered with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. The first is that a man has not from himself the thing in which he excels, for this is, as it were, something Divine in him, wherefore on this count <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due principally, not to him but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The second point that calls for observation is that the thing in which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> excels is given to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may profit others thereby: wherefore a man ought so far to be pleased that others bear witness to his excellence, as this enables him to profit others.

<p>Now the desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> may be inordinate in three ways. First, when a man desires recognition of an excellence which he has not: this is to desire more than his share of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Secondly, when a man desires <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> for himself without referring it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thirdly, when a man's <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rests in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> itself, without referring it to the profit of others. Since then ambition denotes inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, it is evident that it is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should be regulated according to reason, and if it exceed this rule it will be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. On this way it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to desire <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in disaccord with the order of reason. Now those are reproved who care not for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in accordance with reason's dictate that they should avoid what is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Honor is not the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in this sense that he should seek for it as his reward: since the reward he seeks is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But it is said to be the reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as regards others, who have nothing greater than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> whereby to reward the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>; which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> derives greatness from the very fact that it bears witness to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is evident that it is not an adequate reward, as stated in Ethic. iv, 3.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as some are heartened to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and disheartened from doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by the desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, if this be desired in due measure; so, if it be desired inordinately, it may become to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an occasion of doing many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, as when a man cares not by what means he obtains <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Wherefore Sallust says (Catilin.) that "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> covet honors for themselves, but the one," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, "go about it in the right way," whereas "the other," i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, "through lack of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> arts, make use of deceit and falsehood." Yet they who, merely for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, either do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 8), where he says that they who do brave things for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> brave.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether ambition is opposed to magnanimity by excess?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that ambition is not opposed to magnanimity by excess. For one mean has only one extreme opposed to it on the one side. Now presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess as stated above (Question 130, Article 2). Therefore ambition is not opposed to it by excess.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, magnanimity is about honors; whereas ambition seems to regard positions of dignity: for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ma004.htm#verse7">2 Maccabees 4:7</a>) that "Jason ambitiously sought the high <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>." Therefore ambition is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, ambition seems to regard outward show: for it is written (<a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse27">Acts 25:27</a>) that "Agrippa and Berenice . . . with great pomp [ambitione]. . . had entered into the hall of audience" ['Praetorium.' The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> has 'auditorium,' but the meaning is the same], and (<a href="../bible/2ch016.htm#verse14">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>) that when Asa died they "burned spices and . . . ointments over his body" with very great pomp [ambitione]. But magnanimity is not about outward show. Therefore ambition is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Offic. i) that "the more a man exceeds in magnanimity, the more he desires himself alone to dominate others." But this pertains to ambition. Therefore ambition denotes an excess of magnanimity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), ambition signifies inordinate love of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now magnanimity is about honors and makes use of them in a becoming manner. Wherefore it is evident that ambition is opposed to magnanimity as the inordinate to that which is well ordered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Magnanimity regards two things. It regards one as its end, in so far as it is some great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> that the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attempts in proportion to his ability. On this way presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess: because the presumptuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> attempts great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> beyond his ability. The other thing that magnanimity regards is its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, of which it makes right use: and in this way ambition is opposed to magnanimity by excess. Nor is it impossible for one mean to be exceeded in various respects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Honor is due to those who are in a position of dignity, on account of a certain excellence of their estate: and accordingly inordinate desire for positions of dignity pertains to ambition. For if a man were to have an inordinate desire for a position of dignity, not for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but for the sake of a right use of a dignity exceeding his ability, he would not be ambitious but presumptuous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The very <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of outward worship is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, wherefore in such cases <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is wont to be shown. This is signified by the words of <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse2">James 2:2-3</a>: "If there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, in fine apparel . . . and you . . . shall say to him: Sit thou here well," etc. Wherefore ambition does not regard outward worship, except in so far as this is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.
