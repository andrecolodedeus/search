<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the desire of glory is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in being likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: in fact we are commanded (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse1">Ephesians 5:1</a>): "Be ye . . . followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as most dear children." Now by seeking <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seems to imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse6">Isaiah 43:6-7</a>): "Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth. And every one that calleth on My name, I have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him for My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore the desire for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which incites a mar to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is apparently not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> incites men to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For Tully says (De Tusc. Quaest. i) that "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> inflames every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to strive his utmost": and in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is promised for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, according to <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse7">Romans 2:7</a>: "To them, indeed, who according to patience in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work . . . <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Who will render to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works, to them indeed who . . . seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and incorruption, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.']. Therefore the desire for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is "consistent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> report about a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, together with praise": and this comes to the same as what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Maximin. iii), viz. that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is, "as it were, clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with praise." Now it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to desire praiseworthy renown: indeed, it seems itself to call for praise, according to <a href="../bible/sir041.htm#verse15">Sirach 41:15</a>, "Take care of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>," and <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans 12:17</a>, "Providing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things not only in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Therefore the desire of vainglory is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v): "He is better advised who acknowledges that even the love of praise is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Glory signifies a certain clarity, wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. lxxxii, c, cxiv in Joan.) that to be "glorified is the same as to be clarified." Now clarity and comeliness imply a certain display: wherefore the word <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> properly denotes the display of something as regards its seeming comely in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whether it be a bodily or a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Since, however, that which is clear simply can be seen by many, and by those who are far away, it follows that the word <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> properly denotes that somebody's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and approved by many, according to the saying of Sallust (Catilin.) [The quotation is from Livy: Hist., Lib. XXII C, 39: "I must not boast while I am addressing one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>].

<p>But if we take the word <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in a broader sense, it not only consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many, but also in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of few, or of one, or of oneself alone, as when one considers one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as being worthy of praise. Now it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and approve one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>): "Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Likewise it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be willing to approve one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew 5:16</a>): "Let your light shine before men." Hence the desire for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> does not, of itself, denote a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but the desire for empty or vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> denotes a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to desire anything vain, according to <a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse3">Psalm 4:3</a>, "Why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?"

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may be called vain in three ways. First, on the part of the thing for which one seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: as when a man seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for that which is unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for instance when he seeks it for something frail and perishable: secondly, on the part of him from whom he seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for instance a man whose judgment is uncertain: thirdly, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself who seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for that he does not refer the desire of his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to a due end, such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says on <a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse13">John 13:13</a>, "You call Me Master and Lord; and you say well" (Tract. lviii in Joan.): "Self-complacency is fraught with danger of one who has to beware of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. But He Who is above all, however much He may praise Himself, does not uplift Himself. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our need, not His: nor does any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him unless he be taught of Him Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>." It is therefore evident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not for His own sake, but for ours. On like manner a man may rightly seek his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew 5:16</a>, "That they may see your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and glorify your Father Who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That which we receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not vain but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: it is this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that is promised as a reward for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, and of which it is written (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 10:17-18</a>): "He that glorieth let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, for not he who commendeth himself is approved, but he whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth." It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some are heartened to do works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, through desire for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as also through the desire for other earthly goods. Yet he is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> who does <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> proves (De Civ. Dei v).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is requisite for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection that he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself; but not that he should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by others, wherefore it is not to be desired in itself. It may, however, be desired as being useful for something, either in order that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be glorified by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or that men may become better by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by the testimony of others' praise the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is in him, may himself strive to persevere therein and to become better. On this sense it is praiseworthy that a man should "take care of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>," and that he should "provide <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men": but not that he should take an empty pleasure in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether vainglory is opposed to magnanimity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vainglory is not opposed to magnanimity. For, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), vainglory consists in glorying in things that are not, which pertains to falsehood; or in earthly and perishable things, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; or in the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose judgment is uncertain, which pertains to imprudence. Now these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are not contrary to magnanimity. Therefore vainglory is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, vainglory is not, like pusillanimity, opposed to magnanimity by way of deficiency, for this seems inconsistent with vainglory. Nor is it opposed to it by way of excess, for in this way presumption and ambition are opposed to magnanimity, as stated above (130, 2; 131, 2): and these differ from vainglory. Therefore vainglory is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>, "Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vainglory," says: "Some among them were given to dissension and restlessness, contending with one another for the sake of vainglory." But contention [Cf. 38] is not opposed to magnanimity. Neither therefore is vainglory.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading, "Magnanimity consists in two things: We should beware of the desire for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since it enslaves the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which a magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should ever strive to keep untrammeled." Therefore it is opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (103, 1, ad 3), <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is an effect of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and praise: because from the fact that a man is praised, or shown any kind of reverence, he acquires <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others. And since magnanimity is about <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as stated above (129, 1 and 2), it follows that it also is about <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: seeing that as a man uses <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> moderately, so too does he use <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in moderation. Wherefore inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is directly opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To think so much of little things as to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in them is itself opposed to magnanimity. Wherefore it is said of the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (Ethic. iv) that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is of little account to him. On like manner he thinks little of other things that are sought for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor's</a> sake, such as power and wealth. Likewise it is inconsistent with magnanimity to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in things that are not; wherefore it is said of the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (Ethic. iv) that he cares more for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than for opinion. Again it is incompatible with magnanimity for a man to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, as though he deemed this something great; wherefore it is said of the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (Ethic. iv), that he cares not to be praised. And so, when a man looks upon little things as though they were great, nothing hinders this from being contrary to magnanimity, as well as to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> He that is desirous of vainglory does in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> fall short of being magnanimous, because he glories in what the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thinks little of, as stated in the preceding Reply. But if we consider his estimate, he is opposed to the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by way of excess, because the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which he seeks is something great in his estimation, and he tends thereto in excess of his deserts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (127, 2, ad 2), the opposition of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> does not depend on their effects. Nevertheless contention, if done intentionally, is opposed to magnanimity: since no one contends save for what he deems great. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not contentious, because nothing is great in his estimation.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether vainglory is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vainglory is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For nothing precludes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward except a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now vainglory precludes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward: for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse1">Matthew 6:1</a>): "Take heed, that you do not give <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father Who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore vainglory is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever appropriates to himself that which is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally. Now by desiring vainglory, a man appropriates to himself that which is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse8">Isaiah 42:8</a>): "I will not give My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to another," and (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 1:17</a>): "To . . . the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Therefore vainglory is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, apparently a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal if it be most dangerous and harmful. Now vainglory is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of this kind, because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> on <a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who proveth our hearts," says: "Unless a man <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the love of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he does not perceive its baneful power, for though it be easy for anyone not to desire praise as long as one does not get it, it is difficult not to take pleasure in it, when it is given." <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> also says (Hom. xix in Matth.) that "vainglory enters secretly, and robs us insensibly of all our inward possessions." Therefore vainglory is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xiii in the Opus Imperfectum <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] that "while other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> find their abode in the servants of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, vainglory finds a place even in the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Yet in the latter there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore vainglory is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (24, 12; 110, 4; 112, 2), a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mortal through being contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of vainglory, considered in itself, does not seem to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> as regards the love of one's neighbor: yet as regards the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it may be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> in two ways. On one way, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which one glories: for instance when one glories in something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that is opposed to the reverence we owe <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 28:2</a>, "Thy heart is lifted up, and Thou hast said: I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>, "What hast thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as if thou hadst not received it?" Or again when a man prefers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in which he glories: for this is forbidden (<a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse23">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>): "Let not the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his wisdom, and let not the strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his strength, and let not the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. But let him that glorieth <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this, that he understandeth and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Me." Or again when a man prefers the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>; thus it is written in reproval of certain people (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse43">John 12:43</a>): "For they loved the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> more than the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>In another way vainglory may be contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, on the part of the one who glories, in that he refers his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as his last end: so that he directs even <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> thereto, and, in order to obtain it, forbears not from doing even that which is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On this way it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 14) that "this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>," namely the love of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, "is so hostile to a godly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if the heart desires <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> more than it <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> or loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse44">John 5:44</a>): How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> one from another, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, you do not seek?"

<p>If, however, the love of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, though it be vain, be not inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, neither as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> gloried in, nor as to the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of him that seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it is not a mortal but a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>: wherefore a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> loses its power to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, if it be done for the sake of vainglory, even though that vainglory be not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the other hand when a man loses the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward simply through vainglory, and not merely in respect of one act, vainglory is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is desirous of vainglory, desires the excellence which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone differs from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> due to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Vainglory is stated to be a dangerous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not only on account of its gravity, but also because it is a disposition to grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in so far as it renders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> presumptuous and too self-confident: and so it gradually disposes a man to lose his inward goods.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether vainglory is a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that vainglory is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that always arises from another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is seemingly not capital. But vainglory always arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore vainglory is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> would seem to take precedence of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for this is its effect. Now ambition which is inordinate desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Neither therefore is the desire of vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> has a certain prominence. But vainglory seems to have no prominence, neither as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor considered as an appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is apparently a frail thing, and is something outside <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. Therefore vainglory is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi) numbers vainglory among the seven capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are enumerated in two ways. For some reckon <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as one of their number: and these do not place vainglory among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, however (Moral. xxxi), reckons <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to be the queen of all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and vainglory, which is the immediate offspring of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he reckons to be a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: and not without reason. For <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as we shall state farther on (152, 1 and 2), denotes inordinate desire of excellence. But whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> one may desire, one desires a certain perfection and excellence therefrom: wherefore the end of every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is directed to the end of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so that this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> seems to exercise a kind of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> over the other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and ought not to be reckoned among the special sources of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Now among the goods that are the means whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> seems to be the most conducive to that effect, inasmuch as it denotes the manifestation of a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> loved and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by all. Wherefore, just as by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in Divine things, so too by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> he acquires excellence in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. Hence on account of its close connection with excellence, which men desire above all, it follows that it is most desirable. And since many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise from the inordinate desire thereof, it follows that vainglory is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not impossible for a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to arise from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, since as stated above (in the body of the Article and I-II, 84, 2) <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the queen and mother of all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Praise and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), stand in relation to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> from which it proceeds, so that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is compared to them as their end. For the reason why a man loves to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and praised is that he thinks thereby to acquire a certain renown in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Vainglory stands prominent under the aspect of desirability, for the reason given above, and this suffices for it to be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Nor is it always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can arise from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thereto.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the daughters of vainglory are suitably reckoned to be disobedience, boastfulness, hypocrisy, contention, obstinacy, discord, and love of novelties?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the daughters of vainglory are unsuitably reckoned to be "disobedience, boastfulness, hypocrisy, contention, obstinacy, discord, and eccentricity [Praesumptio novitatum, literally 'presumption of novelties']." For according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxiii) boastfulness is numbered among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> does not arise from vainglory, rather is it the other way about, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi). Therefore boastfulness should not be reckoned among the daughters of vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, contention and discord seem to be the outcome chiefly of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> condivided with vainglory. Therefore it seems that they are not the daughters of vainglory.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xix in Matth.) that vainglory is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but especially in philanthropy, i.e. mercy. And yet this is nothing new, for it is an established custom among men. Therefore eccentricity should not be specially reckoned as a daughter of vainglory.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi), who there assigns the above daughters to vainglory.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (34, 5; 35, 4; I-II, 84, A3,4), the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are such as to be directed to the end of a certain capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, are called its daughters. Now the end of vainglory is the manifestation of one's own excellence, as stated above (A1,4): and to this end a man may tend in two ways. On one way directly, either by words, and this is boasting, or by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and then if they be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and call for astonishment, it is love of novelties which men are wont to wonder at most; but if they be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it is hypocrisy. On another way a man strives to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his excellence by showing that he is not inferior to another, and this in four ways. First, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and thus we have "obstinacy," by which a man is too much attached to his own opinion, being unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one that is better. Secondly, as regards the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and then we have "discord," whereby a man is unwilling to give up his own will, and agree with others. Thirdly, as regards "speech," and then we have "contention," whereby a man quarrels noisily with another. Fourthly as regards <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and this is "disobedience," whereby a man refuses to carry out the command of his superiors.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (112, 1, ad 2), boasting is reckoned a kind of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as regards its interior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is arrogance: but outward boasting, according to Ethic. iv, is directed sometimes to gain, but more often to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and thus it is the result of vainglory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Anger is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of discord and contention, except in conjunction with vainglory, in that a man thinks it a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> thing for him not to yield to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and words of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Vainglory is reproved in connection with almsdeeds on account of the lack of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> apparent in one who prefers vainglory to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his neighbor, seeing that he does the latter for the sake of the former. But a man is not reproved for presuming to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> as though this were something novel.
