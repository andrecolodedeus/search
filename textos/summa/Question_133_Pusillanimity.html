<h1>Question 133. Pusillanimity</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3133.htm#article1"> Is pusillanimity a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3133.htm#article2"> To what virtue is it opposed?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether pusillanimity is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that pusillanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes a man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, just as every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes a man <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But a fainthearted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore pusillanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "a fainthearted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is especially one who is worthy of great goods, yet does not deem himself worthy of them." Now no one is worthy of great goods except the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, since as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> again says (Ethic. iv, 3), "none but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Therefore the fainthearted are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>: and consequently pusillanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>). But pusillanimity does not proceed from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sets himself above what he is, while the fainthearted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> withdraws from the things he is worthy of. Therefore pusillanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "he who deems himself less worthy than he is, is said to be fainthearted." Now sometimes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men deem themselves less worthy than they are; for instance, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, who were worthy of the office <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chose them for, which they both humbly declined (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse11">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 1:6</a>). Therefore pusillanimity is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct is to be avoided save <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now pusillanimity is to be avoided: for it is written (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse21">Colossians 3:21</a>): "Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged." Therefore pusillanimity is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now everything has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination to accomplish an action that is commensurate with its power: as is evident in all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, whether animate or inanimate. Now just as presumption makes a man exceed what is proportionate to his power, by striving to do more than he can, so pusillanimity makes a man fall short of what is proportionate to his power, by refusing to tend to that which is commensurate thereto. Wherefore as presumption is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so is pusillanimity. Hence it is that the servant who buried in the earth the money he had received from his master, and did not trade with it through fainthearted fear, was punished by his master (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a>; <a href="../bible/luk019.htm">Luke 19</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> calls those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> who injure their neighbor: and accordingly the fainthearted is said not to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because he injures no one, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, by omitting to do what might be profitable to others. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastoral. i) that if "they who demur to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to their neighbor in preaching be judged strictly, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> their guilt is proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they might have done had they been less retiring."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> venially and without losing the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or mortally and with loss of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence it is possible for a man, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which he has, to be worthy of doing certain great things that are worthy of great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and yet through not trying to make use of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> sometimes venially, sometimes mortally.

<p>Again it may be replied that the fainthearted is worthy of great things in proportion to his ability for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, ability which he derives either from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, or from science, or from external fortune, and if he fails to use those things for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he becomes guilty of pusillanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even pusillanimity may in some way be the result of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: when, to wit, a man clings too much to his own opinion, whereby he thinks himself incompetent for those things for which he is competent. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse16">Proverbs 26:16</a>): "The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that speak sentences." For nothing hinders him from depreciating himself in some things, and having a high opinion of himself in others. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastoral. i) of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that "perchance he would have been proud, had he undertaken the leadership of a numerous people without misgiving: and again he would have been proud, had he refused to obey the command of his Creator."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> were worthy of the office to which they were appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but their worthiness was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>: yet they, considering the insufficiency of their own weakness, demurred; though not obstinately lest they should fall into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic., 3) that "the fainthearted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not himself: for he would desire the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, of which he is worthy, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself." Now <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of self seems opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Therefore pusillanimity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> calls the servant <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and slothful who through pusillanimity refused to make use of the money. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that the fainthearted seem to be slothful. Now sloth is opposed to solicitude, which is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (Question 47, Article 09). Therefore pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, pusillanimity seems to proceed from inordinate fear: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse4">Isaiah 35:4</a>): "Say to the fainthearted: Take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and fear not." It also seems to proceed from inordinate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse21">Colossians 3:21</a>, "Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged." Now inordinate fear is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and inordinate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to meekness. Therefore pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that is in opposition to a particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the more grievous according as it is more unlike that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now pusillanimity is more unlike magnanimity than presumption is. Therefore if pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity, it follows that it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than presumption: yet this is contrary to the saying of <a href="../bible/sir037.htm#verse3">Sirach 37:3</a>, "O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> presumption, whence camest thou?" Therefore pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pusillanimity and magnanimity differ as greatness and littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as their very names denote. Now great and little are opposites. Therefore pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pusillanimity may be considered in three ways. First, in itself; and thus it is evident that by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is opposed to magnanimity, from which it differs as great and little differ in connection with the same subject. For just as the magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tends to great things out of greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so the pusillanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shrinks from great things out of littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Secondly, it may be considered in reference to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of one's own qualification, and on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is the fear of failure in what one <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> deems to exceed one's ability. Thirdly, it may be considered in reference to its effect, which is to shrink from the great things of which one is worthy. But, as stated above (132, 2, ad 3), opposition between <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends rather on their respective <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> than on their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or effect. Hence pusillanimity is directly opposed to magnanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers pusillanimity as proceeding from a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Yet it cannot be said properly that it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, even in respect of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this kind does not proceed from indiscretion but from laziness in considering one's own ability, according to Ethic. iv, 3, or in accomplishing what is within one's power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers pusillanimity from the point of view of its effect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the point of view of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Nor is the fear that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> pusillanimity always a fear of the dangers of death: wherefore it does not follow from this standpoint that pusillanimity is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. As regards <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, if we consider it under the aspect of its proper movement, whereby a man is roused to take vengeance, it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pusillanimity, which disheartens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; on the contrary, it takes it away. If, however, we consider the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which are injuries inflicted whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who suffers them is disheartened, it conduces to pusillanimity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> pusillanimity is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than presumption, since thereby a man withdraws from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which is a very great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to Ethic. iv. Presumption, however, is stated to be "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>" on account of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> whence it proceeds.
