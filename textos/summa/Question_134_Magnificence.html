<h1>Question 134. Magnificence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3134.htm#article1"> Is magnificence a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3134.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3134.htm#article3"> What is its matter?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3134.htm#article4"> Is it a part of fortitude?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether magnificence is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnificence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For whoever has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). But one may have the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without having magnificence: because the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "not every liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is magnificent." Therefore magnificence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mean, according to Ethic. ii, 6. But magnificence does not seemingly observe the mean, for it exceeds liberality in greatness. Now "great" and "little" are opposed to one another as extremes, the mean of which is "equal," as stated in Metaph. x. Hence magnificence observes not the mean, but the extreme. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination, but on the contrary perfects it, as stated above (108, 2;117, 1, Objection 1). Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 2) the "magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not lavish towards himself": and this is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclination one has to look after oneself. Therefore magnificence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 4) "act is right reason about things to be made." Now magnificence is about things to be made, as its very name denotes [Magnificence= magna facere--i.e. to make great things]. Therefore it is an act rather than a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a participation of Divine power. But magnificence [virtutis] belongs to Divine power, according to <a href="../bible/psa047.htm#verse35">Psalm 47:35</a>: "His magnificence and His power is in the clouds." Therefore magnificence is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to De Coelo i, 16, "we speak of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in relation to the extreme limit of a thing's power," not as regards the limit of deficiency, but as regards the limit of excess, the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which denotes something great. Wherefore to do something great, whence magnificence takes its name, belongs properly to the very notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence magnificence denotes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is magnificent as regards his actions, because he lacks the wherewithal to perform magnificent <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Nevertheless every liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of magnificence, either actually or in respect of a proximate disposition thereto, as explained above (129, 3, ad 2), as also (I-II, 65, 1) when we were treating of the connection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that magnificence observes the extreme, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of the thing done: yet it observes the mean, if we consider the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which it neither falls short of nor exceeds, as we have also said of magnanimity (129, 3, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to magnificence to do something great. But that which regards a man's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is little in comparison with that which regards Divine things, or even the affairs of the community at large. Wherefore the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not intend principally to be lavish towards himself, not that he does not seek his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but because to do so is not something great. Yet if anything regarding himself admits of greatness, the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> accomplishes it magnificently: for instance, things that are done once, such as a wedding, or the like; or things that are of a lasting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus it belongs to a magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to provide himself with a suitable dwelling, as stated in Ethic. iv.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vi, 5) "there must needs be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of act," i.e. a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is inclined to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of the rule of act: and this is what magnificence does. Hence it is not an act but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether magnificence is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnificence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For magnificence would seem to consist in doing something great. But it may belong to any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to do something great, if the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be great: as in the case of one who has a great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, for he does a great work of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore, magnificence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but denotes a perfect degree of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly that which tends to a thing is the same as that which does it. But it belongs to magnanimity to tend to something great, as stated above (129, 1 and 2). Therefore it belongs to magnanimity likewise to do something great. Therefore magnificence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, magnificence seems to belong to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse11">Exodus 15:11</a>): "Magnificent [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>'] in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>," and (<a href="../bible/psa095.htm#verse6">Psalm 95:6</a>): "Holiness and magnificence [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'Majesty'] in His sanctuary." Now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is the same as religion, as stated above (Question 81, Article 8). Therefore magnificence is apparently the same as religion. Therefore it is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, distinct from the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> reckons it with other special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Ethic. ii, 7; iv 2).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It belongs to magnificence to do [facere] something great, as its name implies [magnificence= magna facere--i.e. to make great things]. Now "facere" may be taken in two ways, in a strict sense, and in a broad sense. Strictly "facere" means to work something in external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for instance to make a house, or something of the kind; in a broad sense "facere" is employed to denote any action, whether it passes into external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as to burn or cut, or remain in the agent, as to understand or will.

<p>Accordingly if magnificence be taken to denote the doing of something great, the doing [factio] being understood in the strict sense, it is then a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the work done is produced by act: in the use of which it is possible to consider a special aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, namely that the work produced [factum] by the act is something great, namely in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, value, or dignity, and this is what magnificence does. On this way magnificence is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>If, on the other hand, magnificence take its name from doing something great, the doing [facere] being understood in a broad sense, it is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to every perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to do something great in the genus of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if "doing" [facere] be taken in the broad sense, but not if it be taken strictly, for this is proper to magnificence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to magnanimity not only to tend to something great, but also to do great works in all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, either by making [faciendo], or by any kind of action, as stated in Ethic. iv, 3: yet so that magnanimity, in this respect, regards the sole aspect of great, while the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which, if they be perfect, do something great, direct their principal <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, not to something great, but to that which is proper to each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and the greatness of the thing done is sometimes consequent upon the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>On the other hand, it belongs to magnificence not only to do something great, "doing" [facere] being taken in the strict sense, but also to tend with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to the doing of great things. Hence Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "magnificence is the discussing and administering of great and lofty undertakings, with a certain broad and noble purpose of mind, discussion" referring to the inward <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, and "administration" to the outward accomplishment. Wherefore just as magnanimity intends something great in every <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it follows that magnificence does the same in every work that can be produced in external <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> [factibili].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of magnificence is the production of a great work. Now works done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are directed to an end: and no end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> works is so great as the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore magnificence does a great work especially in reference to the Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "the most commendable expenditure is that which is directed to Divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>": and this is the chief object of magnificence. For this reason magnificence is connected with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, since its chief effect is directed to religion or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the matter of magnificence is great expenditure?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnificence is not great expenditure. For there are not two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But liberality is about expenditure, as stated above (Question 117, Article 2). Therefore magnificence is not about expenditure.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "every magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is liberal" (Ethic. iv, 2). But liberality is about <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> rather than about expenditure. Therefore magnificence also is not chiefly about expenditure, but about <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to magnificence to produce an external work. But not even great expenditure is always the means of producing an external work, for instance when one spends much in sending presents. Therefore expenditure is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnificence.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, only the rich are capable of great expenditure. But the poor are able to possess all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> require external fortune, but are sufficient for themselves," as Seneca says (De Ira i: De vita beata xvi). Therefore magnificence is not about great expenditure.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "magnificence does not extend, like liberality, to all transactions in money, but only to expensive ones, wherein it exceeds liberality in scale." Therefore it is only about great expenditure.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), it belongs to magnificence to intend doing some great work. Now for the doing of a great work, proportionate expenditure is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for great works cannot be produced without great expenditure. Hence it belongs to magnificence to spend much in order that some great work may be accomplished in becoming manner. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "a magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will produce a more magnificent work with equal," i.e. proportionate, "expenditure." Now expenditure is the outlay of a sum of money; and a man may be hindered from making that outlay if he love money too much. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnificence may be said to be both this expenditure itself, which the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> uses to produce a great work, and also the very money which he employs in going to great expense, and as well as the love of money, which love the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> moderates, lest he be hindered from spending much.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 129, Article 2), those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about external things experience a certain difficulty arising from the genus itself of the thing about which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned, and another difficulty besides arising from the greatness of that same thing. Hence the need for two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, concerned about money and its use; namely, liberality, which regards the use of money in general, and magnificence, which regards that which is great in the use of money.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The use of money regards the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in one way and the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in another. For it regards the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as it proceeds from an ordinate affection in respect of money; wherefore all due use of money (such as <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> and expenditure), the obstacles to which are removed by a moderate love of money, belongs to liberality. But the use of money regards the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in relation to some great work which has to be produced, and this use is impossible without expenditure or outlay.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also makes <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of presents, as stated in Ethic. iv, 2, but not under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but rather under the aspect of expenditure directed to the production of some work, for instance in order to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> someone, or in order to do something which will reflect <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> on the whole state: as when he brings to effect what the whole state is striving for.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The chief act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the inward choice, and a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may have this without outward fortune: so that even a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be magnificent. But goods of fortune are requisite as instruments to the external acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in this way a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot accomplish the outward act of magnificence in things that are great simply. Perhaps, however, he may be able to do so in things that are great by comparison to some particular work; which, though little in itself, can nevertheless be done magnificently in proportion to its genus: for little and great are relative terms, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Praedic. Cap. Ad aliquid.).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether magnificence is a part of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that magnificence is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For magnificence agrees in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> with liberality, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). But liberality is a part, not of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore magnificence is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and darings. But magnificence seems to have nothing to do with fear, but only with expenditure, which is a kind of action. Therefore magnificence seems to pertain to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is about actions, rather than to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is like the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of science." Now science has more in common with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> than with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore magnificence should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) and Macrobius (De Somn. Scip. i) and Andronicus reckon magnificence to be a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Magnificence, in so far as it is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cannot be reckoned a subjective part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, since it does not agree with this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the point of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: but it is reckoned a part thereof, as being annexed to it as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>In order for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be annexed to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, two things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as stated above (<a href="#80">Article 80</a>). The one is that the secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> agree with the principal, and the other is that in some respect it be exceeded thereby. Now magnificence agrees with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in the point that as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> tends to something arduous and difficult, so also does magnificence: wherefore seemingly it is seated, like <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in the irascible. Yet magnificence falls short of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in that the arduous thing to which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> tends derives its difficulty from a danger that threatens the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whereas the arduous thing to which magnificence tends, derives its difficulty from the dispossession of one's property, which is of much less account than danger to one's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Wherefore magnificence is accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Justice regards operations in themselves, as viewed under the aspect of something due: but liberality and magnificence regard sumptuary operations as related to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, albeit in different ways. For liberality regards expenditure in reference to the love and desire of money, which are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty, and do not hinder the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from giving and spending: so that this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. On the other hand, magnificence regards expenditure in reference to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, by attaining to the difficulty, not simply, as magnanimity does, but in a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely expenditure: wherefore magnificence, like magnanimity, is apparently in the irascible part.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although magnificence does not agree with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it agrees with it as the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: since it tends to something difficult in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of expenditure, even as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> tends to something difficult in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of fear.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Magnificence directs the use of art to something great, as stated above and in the preceding Article. Now art is in the reason. Wherefore it belongs to the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> by observing proportion of expenditure to the work he has in hand. This is especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> on account of the greatness of both those things, since if he did not take careful thought, he would incur the risk of a great loss.
