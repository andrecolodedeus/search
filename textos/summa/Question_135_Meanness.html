<h1>Question 135. Meanness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3135.htm#article1"> Is meanness a vice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3135.htm#article2"> The vice opposed to it</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether meanness is a vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that meanness is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For just as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> moderates great things, so does it moderate little things: wherefore both the liberal and the magnificent do little things. But magnificence is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore likewise meanness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "careful reckoning is mean." But careful reckoning is apparently praiseworthy, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be in accordance with reason, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv, 4). Therefore meanness is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "a mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is loth to spend money." But this belongs to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> or illiberality. Therefore meanness is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> from the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii) accounts meanness a special <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to magnificence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 01, 3; I-II, 18, 6), moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end, wherefore in many cases they are denominated from that end. Accordingly a man is said to be mean [parvificus] because he intends to do something little [parvum]. Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Praedic. Cap. Ad aliquid.) great and little are relative terms: and when we say that a mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends to do something little, this must be understood in relation to the kind of work he does. This may be little or great in two ways: in one way as regards the work itself to be done, in another as regards the expense. Accordingly the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends principally the greatness of his work, and secondarily he intends the greatness of the expense, which he does not shirk, so that he may produce a great work. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 4) that "the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with equal expenditure will produce a more magnificent result." On the other hand, the mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends principally to spend little, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "he seeks how he may spend least." As a result of this he intends to produce a little work, that is, he does not shrink from producing a little work, so long as he spends little. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that "the mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after going to great expense forfeits the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" of the magnificent work, "for the trifle" that he is unwilling to spend. Therefore it is evident that the mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fails to observe the proportion that reason demands between expenditure and work. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is that it consists in failing to do what is in accordance with reason. Hence it is manifest that meanness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtue moderates little things, according to the rule of reason: from which rule the mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> declines, as stated in the Article. For he is called mean, not for moderating little things, but for declining from the rule of reason in moderating great or little things: hence meanness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5), "fear makes us take counsel": wherefore a mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is careful in his reckonings, because he has an inordinate fear of spending his goods, even in things of the least account. Hence this is not praiseworthy, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and reprehensible, because then a man does not regulate his affections according to reason, but, on the contrary, makes use of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in pursuance of his inordinate affections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has this in common with the liberal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he spends his money readily and with pleasure, so too the mean <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in common with the illiberal or covetous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is loth and slow to spend. Yet they differ in this, that illiberality regards ordinary expenditure, while meanness regards great expenditure, which is a more difficult accomplishment: wherefore meanness is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> than illiberality. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 2) that "although meanness and its contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, they do not bring shame on a man, since neither do they harm one's neighbor, nor are they very disgraceful."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is a vice opposed to meanness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to meanness. For great is opposed to little. Now, magnificence is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to meanness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since meanness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by deficiency, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it seems that if any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to meanness, it would merely consist in excessive spending. But those who spend much, where they ought to spend little, spend little where they ought to spend much, according to Ethic. iv, 2, and thus they have something of meanness. Therefore there is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to meanness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, moral acts take their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from their end, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now those who spend excessively, do so in order to make a show of their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv, 2. But this belongs to vainglory, which is opposed to magnanimity, as stated above (Question 131, Article 2). Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to meanness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> who (Ethic. ii, 8; iv, 2) places magnificence as a mean between two opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Great is opposed to little. Also little and great are relative terms, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now just as expenditure may be little in comparison with the work, so may it be great in comparison with the work in that it exceeds the proportion which reason requires to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> between expenditure and work. Hence it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of meanness, whereby a man intends to spend less than his work is worth, and thus fails to observe due proportion between his expenditure and his work, has a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to it, whereby a man exceeds this same proportion, by spending more than is proportionate to his work. This <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is called in Greek <em>banausia</em>, so called from the Greek <em>baunos</em>, because, like the fire in the furnace, it consumes everything. It is also called <em>apyrokalia</em>, i.e. lacking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fire, since like fire it consumes all, but not for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> purpose. Hence in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> it may be called "consumptio" [waste].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Magnificence is so called from the great work done, but not from the expenditure being in excess of the work: for this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which is opposed to meanness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To the one same <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> there is opposed the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which observes the mean, and a contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Accordingly, then, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of waste is opposed to meanness in that it exceeds in expenditure the value of the work, by spending much where it behooved to spend little. But it is opposed to magnificence on the part of the great work, which the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends principally, in so far as when it behooves to spend much, it spends little or nothing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Wastefulness is opposed to meanness by the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of its act, since it exceeds the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereas meanness falls short of it. Yet nothing hinders this from being directed to the end of another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, such as vainglory or any other.
