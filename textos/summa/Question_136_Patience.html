<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether patience is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that patience is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are most perfect in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv). Yet patience is not there, since no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have to be borne there, according to <a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse10">Isaiah 49:10</a> and <a href="../bible/rev007.htm#verse16">Apocalypse 7:16</a>, "They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun strike them." Therefore patience is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be found in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it is "that makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Yet patience is sometimes found in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men; for instance, in the covetous, who bear many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> patiently that they may amass money, according to <a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse16">Ecclesiastes 5:16</a>, "All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery and in sorrow." Therefore patience is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruits differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 70, 1, ad 3). But patience is reckoned among the fruits (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians 5:22</a>). Therefore patience is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia i): "The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is called patience, is so great a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we even preach the patience of Him who bestows it upon us."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 123, Article 1), the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, inasmuch as they safeguard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against the impulse of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now among the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> sorrow is strong to hinder the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>, "The sorrow of the world worketh death," and <a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse25">Sirach 30:25</a>, "Sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it." Hence the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against sorrow, lest reason give way to sorrow: and this patience does. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia ii): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> patience it is whereby he bears <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with an equal mind," i.e. without being disturbed by sorrow, "lest he abandon with an unequal mind the goods whereby he may advance to better things." It is therefore evident that patience is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> do not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as regards the same act that they have on the way, in relation, namely, to the goods of the present life, which will not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: but they will remain in their relation to the end, which will be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will not be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in relation to buying and selling and other matters pertaining to the present life, but it will remain in the point of being subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On like manner the act of patience, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, will not consist in bearing things, but in enjoying the goods to which we had aspired by suffering. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv) that "patience itself will not be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, since there is no need for it except where <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have to be borne: yet that which we shall obtain by patience will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia ii; v) "properly speaking those are patient who would rather bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> without inflicting them, than inflict them without bearing them. As for those who bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that they may inflict <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, their patience is neither marvelous nor praiseworthy, for it is no patience at all: we may marvel at their hardness of heart, but we must refuse to call them patient."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 11, 1), the very notion of fruit denotes pleasure. And works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> afford pleasure in themselves, as stated in Ethic. i, 8. Now the names of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are wont to be applied to their acts. Wherefore patience as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. but as to the pleasure which its act affords, it is reckoned a fruit, especially in this, that patience safeguards the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from being overcome by sorrow.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether patience is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that patience is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For in every genus that which is perfect is the greatest. Now "patience hath a perfect work" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse4">James 1:4</a>). Therefore patience is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now this seems to belong chiefly to patience; for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse19">Luke 21:19</a>): "In your patience you shall possess your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." Therefore patience is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seemingly that which is the safeguard and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of other things is greater than they are. But according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xxxv in Evang.) "patience is the root and safeguard of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore patience is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is not reckoned among the four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxii) and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Morib. Eccl. xv) call principal.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtues by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that "makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and renders the latter's work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" (Ethic. ii, 6). Hence it follows that a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> superiority and preponderance over other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is the greater according as it inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more effectively and directly. Now those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are effective of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, incline a man more directly to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than those which are a check on the things which lead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and just as among those that are effective of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the greater is that which establishes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (thus <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are greater than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>); so too among those that are a check on things that withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the one which is a check on a greater obstacle to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But dangers of death, about which is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and pleasures of touch, with which <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is concerned, withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more than any kind of hardship, which is the object of patience. Therefore patience is not the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but falls short, not only of the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which directly establish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but also of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which withdraw him from greater obstacles to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Patience is said to have a perfect work in bearing hardships: for these give rise first to sorrow, which is moderated by patience; secondly, to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is moderated by meekness; thirdly, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> removes; fourthly, to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> injury, which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> forbids. Now that which removes the principle is the most perfect.

<p>Yet it does not follow, if patience be more perfect in this respect, that it is more perfect simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Possession denotes undisturbed ownership; wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to possess his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by patience, in so far as it removes by the root the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that are evoked by hardships and disturb the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Patience is said to be the root and safeguard of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, not as though it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> and preserved them directly, but merely because it removes their obstacles.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether it is possible to have patience without grace?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that it is possible to have patience without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the more his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> inclines to a thing, the more is it possible for the rational creature to accomplish it. Now it is more reasonable to suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Yet some suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil's</a> sake, by their own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia iii) that "men endure many toils and sorrows for the sake of the things they love sinfully." Much more, therefore, is it possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this is to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> patient.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some who are not in a state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace</a> have more abhorrence for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> than for bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: hence some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are related to have endured many hardships rather than betray their country or commit some other misdeed. Now this is to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> patient. Therefore it seems that it is possible to have patience without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is quite evident that some go through much trouble and pain in order to regain health of the body. Now the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not less desirable than bodily health. Therefore in like manner one may, without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, endure many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for the health of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and this is to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> patient.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse6">Psalm 61:6</a>): "From Him," i.e. from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "is my patience."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia iv), "the strength of desire helps a man to bear toil and pain: and no one willingly undertakes to bear what is painful, save for the sake of that which gives pleasure." The reason of this is because sorrow and pain are of themselves displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherefore it would never choose to suffer them for their own sake, but only for the sake of an end. Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the sake of which one is willing to endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, is more desired and loved than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> the privation of which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the sorrow that we bear patiently. Now the fact that a man prefers the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> goods, the loss of which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow, is to be referred to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things. Hence it is evident that patience, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>, "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is patient."

<p>But it is manifest that it is impossible to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> save through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is given to us." Therefore it is clearly impossible to have patience without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The inclination of reason would prevail in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the state of integrity. But in corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the inclination of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> prevails, because it is dominant in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more prone to bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for the sake of goods in which the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> delights here and now, than to endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for the sake of goods to come, which are desired in accordance with reason: and yet it is this that pertains to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a social <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> [Cf. I-II, 61, 5] is commensurate with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and consequently the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will can tend thereto without the help of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, yet not without the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [Cf. I-II, 109, 2]. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot tend thereto by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even the endurance of those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which a man bears for the sake of his body's health, proceeds from the love a man <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> has for his own flesh. Hence there is no comparison between this endurance and patience which proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> love.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether patience is a part of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that patience is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For a thing is not part of itself. Now patience is apparently the same as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: because, as stated above (Question 123, Article 6), the proper act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is to endure; and this belongs also to patience. For it is stated in the Liber Sententiarum Prosperi [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Hom. xxxv in Evang.] that "patience consists in enduring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> inflicted by others." Therefore patience is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring, as stated above (Question 123, Article 3), and thus it is in the irascible. But patience seems to be about sorrow, and consequently would seem to be in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Therefore patience is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the whole cannot be without its part. Therefore if patience is a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, there can be no <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> without patience. Yet sometimes a brave <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> patiently, but even attacks the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who inflicts the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore patience is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons it a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Patience is a quasi-<a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because it is annexed thereto as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it belongs to patience "to suffer with an equal mind the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> inflicted by others," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (xxxv in Evang.). Now of those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that are inflicted by others, foremost and most difficult to endure are those that are connected with the danger of death, and about these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is concerned. Hence it is clear that in this matter <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> has the principal place, and that it lays claim to that which is principal in this matter. Wherefore patience is annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for which reason Prosper calls patience brave (Sent. 811).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to endure, not anything indeed, but that which is most difficult to endure, namely dangers of death: whereas it may pertain to patience to endure any kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> consists not only in holding fast to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> against the fear of future dangers, but also in not failing through sorrow or pain occasioned by things present; and it is in the latter respect that patience is akin to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly about fear, which of itself evokes flight which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> avoids; while patience is chiefly about sorrow, for a man is said to be patient, not because he does not fly, but because he behaves in a praiseworthy manner by suffering [patiendo] things which hurt him here and now, in such a way as not to be inordinately saddened by them. Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is properly in the irascible, while patience is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculty.

<p>Nor does this hinder patience from being a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because the annexing of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not regard the subject, but the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Nevertheless patience is not to be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, although both are in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is only about those sorrows that are opposed to pleasures of touch, such as arise through abstinence from pleasures of food and sex: whereas patience is chiefly about sorrows inflicted by other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Moreover it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to control these sorrows besides their contrary pleasures: whereas it belongs to patience that a man forsake not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on account of such like sorrows, however great they be.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It may be granted that patience in a certain respect is an integral part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if we consider the fact that a man may patiently endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> pertaining to dangers of death; and it is from this point of view that the objection argues. Nor is it inconsistent with patience that a man should, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, rise up against the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who inflicts <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> on him; for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [<a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">Homily</a> v. in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says on <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew 4:10</a>, "Begone Satan," that "it is praiseworthy to be patient under our own wrongs, but to endure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wrongs patiently is most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a letter to Marcellinus (Ep. cxxxviii) that "the precepts of patience are not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the commonwealth, since in order to ensure that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we fight against our enemies." But in so far as patience regards all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, it is annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether patience is the same as longanimity? [Longsuffering. It is necessary to preserve the Latin word, on account of the comparison with magnanimity.]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that patience is the same as longanimity. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Patientia i) that "we speak of patience in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as though any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> made Him suffer, but because He awaits the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that they may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse4">Sirach 5:4</a>): "The Most High is a patient rewarder." Therefore it seems that patience is the same as longanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same thing is not contrary to two things. But impatience is contrary to longanimity, whereby one awaits a delay: for one is said to be impatient of delay, as of other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Therefore it seems that patience is the same as longanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as time is a circumstance of wrongs endured, so is place. But no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is distinct from patience on the score of place. Therefore in like manner longanimity which takes count of time, in so far as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> waits for a long time, is not distinct from patience.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Comment. in Ep. ad Rom. ii] on <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans 2:4</a>, "Or despisest thou the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and patience, and longsuffering?" says: "It seems that longanimity differs from patience, because those who offend from weakness rather than of set purpose are said to be borne with longanimity: while those who take a deliberate delight in their crimes are said to be borne patiently."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as by magnanimity a man has a mind to tend to great things, so by longanimity a man has a mind to tend to something a long way off. Wherefore as magnanimity regards hope, which tends to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, rather than daring, fear, or sorrow, which have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as their object, so also does longanimity. Hence longanimity has more in common with magnanimity than with patience.

<p>Nevertheless it may have something in common with patience, for two reasons. First, because patience, like <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, endures certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and if this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is awaited shortly, endurance is easier: whereas if it be delayed a long time, it is more difficult. Secondly, because the very delay of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we hope for, is of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow, according to <a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse12">Proverbs 13:12</a>, "Hope that is deferred afflicteth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Hence there may be patience in bearing this trial, as in enduring any other sorrows. Accordingly longanimity and constancy are both comprised under patience, in so far as both the delay of the hoped for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> (which regards longanimity) and the toil which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endures in persistently accomplishing a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work (which regards constancy) may be considered under the one aspect of grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>For this reason Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) in defining patience, says that "patience is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and prolonged endurance of arduous and difficult things for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or profit." By saying "arduous" he refers to constancy in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; when he says "difficult" he refers to the grievousness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the proper object of patience; and by adding "continued" or "long lasting," he refers to longanimity, in so far as it has something in common with patience.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the First and Second Objections.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is a long way off as to place, though distant from us, is not simply distant from things in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as that which is a long way off in point of time: hence the comparison fails. Moreover, what is remote as to place offers no difficulty save in the point of time, since what is placed a long way from us is a long time coming to us.

<p>We grant the fourth argument. We must observe, however, that the reason for the difference assigned by this <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is that it is hard to bear with those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through weakness, merely because they persist a long time in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, wherefore it is said that they are borne with longanimity: whereas the very fact of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seems to be unendurable; for which reason those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> are stated to be borne with patience.
