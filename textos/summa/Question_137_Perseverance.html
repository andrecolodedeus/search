<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether perseverance is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that perseverance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 7), <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is greater than perseverance. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. iv, 9. Therefore perseverance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lives aright," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). Now according to the same authority (De Persever. i), no one can be said to have perseverance while living, unless he persevere until death. Therefore perseverance is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is requisite of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that one should persist unchangeably in the work of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Ethic. ii, 4. But this is what we understand by perseverance: for Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "perseverance is the fixed and continued persistence in a well-considered purpose." Therefore perseverance is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Andronicus [Chrysippus: in De Affect.] says that "perseverance is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> regarding things to which we ought to stand, and those to which we ought not to stand, as well as those that are indifferent." Now a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that directs us to do something well, or to omit something, is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore perseverance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 3), "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>"; and so where there is a special kind of difficulty or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, there is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> may involve <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or difficulty on two counts. First, from the act's very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is considered in respect of the proper object of that act: secondly, from the length of time, since to persist long in something difficult involves a special difficulty. Hence to persist long in something <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> until it is accomplished belongs to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Accordingly just as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for the reason that the one moderates pleasures of touch (which is of itself a difficult thing), while the other moderates fear and daring in connection with dangers of death (which also is something difficult in itself), so perseverance is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it consists in enduring delays in the above or other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> requires.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is taking perseverance there, as it is found in one who bears those things which are most difficult to endure long. Now it is difficult to endure, not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that involve danger of death, for the most part are not endured for a long time, because often they soon pass away: wherefore it is not on this account that perseverance has its chief title to praise. Among other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> foremost are those which are opposed to pleasures of touch, because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this kind affect the necessaries of life: such are the lack of food and the like, which at times call for long endurance. Now it is not difficult to endure these things for a long time for one who grieves not much at them, nor delights much in the contrary goods; as in the case of the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in whom these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>. But they are most difficult to bear for one who is strongly affected by such things, through lacking the perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that moderates these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Wherefore if perseverance be taken in this sense it is not a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but something imperfect in the genus of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the other hand, if we take perseverance as denoting long persistence in any kind of difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is consistent in one who has even perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for even if it is less difficult for him to persist, yet he persists in the more perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore such like perseverance may be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives perfection from the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather than from the aspect of difficulty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sometimes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and its act go by the same name: thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. in Joan. lxxix): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without seeing." Yet it is possible to have a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without performing the act: thus a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of magnificence without exercising the act. Sometimes, however, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, begins to perform the act, yet does not accomplish it, for instance a builder begins to build a house, but does not complete it. Accordingly we must reply that the term "perseverance" is sometimes used to denote the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby one chooses to persevere, sometimes for the act of persevering: and sometimes one who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of perseverance chooses to persevere and begins to carry out his choice by persisting for a time, yet completes not the act, through not persisting to the end. Now the end is twofold: one is the end of the work, the other is the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Properly speaking it belongs to perseverance to persevere to the end of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> work, for instance that a soldier persevere to the end of the fight, and the magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> until his work be accomplished. There are, however, some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whose acts must endure throughout the whole of life, such as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since they regard the last end of the entire life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore as regards these which are the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the act of perseverance is not accomplished until the end of life. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks of perseverance as denoting the consummate act of perseverance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Unchangeable persistence may belong to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. First, on account of the intended end that is proper to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and thus to persist in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a long time until the end, belongs to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> called perseverance, which intends this as its special end. Secondly, by reason of the relation of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> to its subject: and thus unchangeable persistence is consequent upon every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a "<a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> difficult to change."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether perseverance is a part of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that perseverance is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. viii, 7), "perseverance is about pains of touch." But these belong to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore perseverance is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every part of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> moderates. Now perseverance does not imply moderation of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: since the more <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the more praiseworthy is it to persevere in accordance with reason. Therefore it seems that perseverance is a part not of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but rather of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which perfects the reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Persev. i) that no one can lose perseverance; whereas one can lose the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore perseverance is greater than all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is greater than its part. Therefore perseverance is not a part of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but is itself a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons perseverance as a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (123, 2; I-II, 61, 3,4), a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one to which is principally ascribed something that lays claim to the praise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, inasmuch as it practices it in connection with its own <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, wherein it is most difficult of accomplishment. On accordance with this it has been stated (123, 2) that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it observes firmness in matters wherein it is most difficult to stand firm, namely in dangers of death. Wherefore it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which has a title to praise for the firm endurance of something difficult must be annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the endurance of difficulty arising from delay in accomplishing a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work gives perseverance its claim to praise: nor is this so difficult as to endure dangers of death. Therefore perseverance is annexed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The annexing of secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depends not only on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> [Cf. 136, 4, ad 2], but also on the mode, because in everything form is of more account than <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore although, as to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, perseverance seems to have more in common with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> than with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, yet, in mode, it has more in common with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, in the point of standing firm against the difficulty arising from length of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The perseverance of which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks (Ethic. vii, 4,7) does not moderate any <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but consists merely in a certain firmness of reason and will. But perseverance, considered as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, moderates certain <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, namely fear of weariness or failure on account of the delay. Hence this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, like <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, is in the irascible.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks there of perseverance, as denoting, not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act sustained to the end, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">Matthew 24:13</a>, "He that shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved." Hence it is incompatible with such like perseverance for it to be lost, since it would no longer endure to the end.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether constancy pertains to perseverance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that constancy does not pertain to perseverance. For constancy pertains to patience, as stated above (Question 137, Article 5): and patience differs from perseverance. Therefore constancy does not pertain to perseverance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now it does not seem difficult to be constant in little works, but only in great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which pertain to magnificence. Therefore constancy pertains to magnificence rather than to perseverance.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if constancy pertained to perseverance, it would seem nowise to differ from it, since both denote a kind of unchangeableness. Yet they differ: for Macrobius (In Somn. Scip. i) condivides constancy with firmness by which he indicates perseverance, as stated above (128, 6). Therefore constancy does not pertain to perseverance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> One is said to be constant because one stands to a thing. Now it belongs to perseverance to stand to certain things, as appears from the definition given by Andronicus. Therefore constancy belongs to perseverance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Perseverance and constancy agree as to end, since it belongs to both to persist firmly in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but they differ as to those things which make it difficult to persist in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of perseverance properly makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> persist firmly in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, against the difficulty that arises from the very continuance of the act: whereas constancy makes him persist firmly in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> against difficulties arising from any other external hindrances. Hence perseverance takes precedence of constancy as a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because the difficulty arising from continuance of action is more intrinsic to the act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than that which arises from external obstacles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> External obstacles to persistence in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are especially those which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> sorrow. Now patience is about sorrow, as stated above (Question 136, Article 1). Hence constancy agrees with perseverance as to end: while it agrees with patience as to those things which occasion difficulty. Now the end is of most account: wherefore constancy pertains to perseverance rather than to patience.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is more difficult to persist in great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: yet in little or ordinary <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it is difficult to persist for any length of time, if not on account of the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> which magnificence considers, yet from its very continuance which perseverance regards. Hence constancy may pertain to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Constancy pertains to perseverance in so far as it has something in common with it: but it is not the same thing in the point of their difference, as stated in the Article.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether perseverance needs the help of grace? [Cf. I-II, 109, 10]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that perseverance does not need the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For perseverance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Now according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> acts after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore the sole inclination of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> suffices for perseverance. Therefore this does not need the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is greater than the harm brought upon us by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans 5:15, seqq</a>. Now "before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was so framed that he could persevere by means of what he had received," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Correp. et Grat. xi). Much more therefore can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, after being repaired by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, persevere without the help of a further <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are sometimes more difficult than <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: hence it is said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse7">Wisdom 5:7</a>): "We . . . have walked through hard ways." Now some persevere in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> without the help of another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can also persevere in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Persev. i): "We hold that perseverance is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby we persevere unto the end, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, ad 2; 2, ad 3), perseverance has a twofold signification. First, it denotes the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of perseverance, considered as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this way it needs the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as the other infused <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Secondly, it may be taken to denote the act of perseverance enduring until death: and in this sense it needs not only <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also the gratuitous help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sustaining <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> until the end of life, as stated above (I-II, 109, 10), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Because, since the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is changeable by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which changeableness is not taken away from it by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed in the present life, it is not in the power of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, albeit repaired by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to abide unchangeably in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, though it is in its power to choose this: for it is often in our power to choose yet not to accomplish.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of perseverance, so far as it is concerned, inclines one to persevere: yet since it is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is a thing one uses at will, it does not follow that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> uses it unchangeably until death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Correp. et Grat. xi), "it was given to the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not to persevere, but to be able to persevere of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: because then no corruption was in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to make perseverance difficult. Now, however, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the predestined receive not only the possibility of persevering, but perseverance itself. Wherefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> threatened, of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> rebelling against a threatening <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forfeited so great a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and so great a facility of avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas these, although the world rage against their constancy, have persevered in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is able by himself to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but he cannot by himself arise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence by falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so far as he is concerned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes himself to be persevering in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless he be delivered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. On the other hand, by doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he does not make himself to be persevering in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because he is able, by himself, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore he needs the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for that end.
