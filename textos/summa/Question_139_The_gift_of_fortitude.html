<h1>Question 139. The gift of fortitude</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3139.htm#article1"> Is fortitude a gift?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3139.htm#article2"> Which among the beatitudes and fruits correspond to it?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fortitude is a gift?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>: and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore it should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the acts of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as stated above (I-II, 68, 6). But the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> does not remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i) that "<a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> encourages the fainthearted against hardships, which will be altogether absent from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that "it is a sign of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to cut oneself adrift from all the deadly pleasures of the passing show." Now noisome pleasures and delights are the concern of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Fortitude is reckoned among the other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah 11:2</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fortitude denotes a certain firmness of mind, as stated above (123, 2; I-II, 61, 3): and this firmness of mind is required both in doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and in enduring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, especially with regard to goods or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that are difficult. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to his proper and connatural mode, is able to have this firmness in both these respects, so as not to forsake the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on account of difficulties, whether in accomplishing an arduous work, or in enduring grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> denotes a special or general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (Question 123, Article 2).

<p>Yet furthermore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in order that he may attain the end of each work begun, and avoid whatever perils may threaten. This surpasses <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for sometimes it is not in a man's power to attain the end of his work, or to avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> or dangers, since these may happen to overwhelm him in death. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> works this in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by bringing him to everlasting life, which is the end of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and the release from all perils. A certain confidence of this is infused into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who expels any fear of the contrary. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For it has been stated above (I-II, 68, 1 and 2) that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> regard the motion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fortitude, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, perfects the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in the endurance of all perils whatever; but it does not go so far as to give confidence of overcoming all dangers: this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> have not the same acts in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as on the way: for they exercise acts in connection with the enjoyment of the end. Hence the act of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> there is to enjoy full security from toil and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> not only because it consists in enduring dangers, but also inasmuch as it consists in accomplishing any difficult work. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is directed by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel, which seems to be concerned chiefly with the greater goods.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the fourth beatitude: "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice," corresponds to the gift of fortitude?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the fourth beatitude, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>," does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety and not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now hungering and thirsting after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pertain to the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore this beatitude corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of piety rather than to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, hunger and thirst after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> imply a desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now this belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, and not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, corresponds, as stated above (<a href="#45">Article 45</a>). Therefore this beatitude corresponds, not to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the fruits are consequent upon the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, since delight is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to beatitude, according to Ethic. i, 8. Now the fruits, apparently, include none pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore neither does any beatitude correspond to it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i): "Fortitude becomes the hungry and thirsty: since those who desire to enjoy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goods, and wish to avoid <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> earthly and material things, must toil."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 121, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> correspond to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> according to the order in which they are set forth, observing at the same time a certain fittingness between them. Wherefore he ascribes the fourth beatitude, concerning the hunger and thirst for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to the fourth <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p>Yet there is a certain congruity between them, because, as stated (1), <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about difficult things. Now it is very difficult, not merely to do <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which receive the common designation of works of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but furthermore to do them with an unsatiable desire, which may be signified by hunger and thirst for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xv in Matth.), we may understand here not only particular, but also universal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is related to all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> according to Ethic. v, 1, wherein whatever is hard is the object of that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is the root of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, as stated above (23, 8, ad 3; I-II, 68, 4, ad 3). Hence whatever pertains to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> may also be referred to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two of the fruits which correspond sufficiently to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: namely, patience, which regards the enduring of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: and longanimity, which may regard the long delay and accomplishment of goods.
