<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a name can be given to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no name can be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i) that, "Of Him there is neither name, nor can one be found of Him;" and it is written: "What is His name, and what is the name of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, if thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a>?" (<a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse4">Proverbs 30:4</a>).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every name is either abstract or concrete. But concrete names do not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is simple, nor do abstract names belong to Him, forasmuch as they do not signify any perfect subsisting thing. Therefore no name can be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, nouns are taken to signify <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; verbs and participles signify <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with time; pronouns the same with demonstration or relation. But none of these can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He has no <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, nor time; moreover, He cannot be felt, so as to be pointed out; nor can He be described by relation, inasmuch as relations serve to recall a thing mentioned before by nouns, participles, or demonstrative pronouns. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot in any way be named by us.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse3">Exodus 15:3</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is a man of war, Almighty is His name."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Peri Herm. i), words are signs of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> the similitude of things, it is evident that words relate to the meaning of things signified through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception. It follows therefore that we can give a name to anything in as far as we can understand it. Now it was shown above (12, 11, 12) that in this life we cannot see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures as their principle, and also by way of excellence and remotion. In this way therefore He can be named by us from creatures, yet not so that the name which signifies Him expresses the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in itself. Thus the name "man" expresses the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in himself, since it signifies the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by manifesting his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> expressed by the name is the definition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no name, or is said to be above being named, is because His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is above all that we understand about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and signify in word.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures, the names we attribute to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signify what belongs to material creatures, of which the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us. And because in creatures of this kind what is perfect and subsistent is compound; whereas their form is not a complete subsisting thing, but rather is that whereby a thing is; hence it follows that all names used by us to signify a complete subsisting thing must have a concrete meaning as applicable to compound things; whereas names given to signify simple forms, signify a thing not as subsisting, but as that whereby a thing is; as, for instance, whiteness signifies that whereby a thing is white. And as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is simple, and subsisting, we attribute to Him abstract names to signify His simplicity, and concrete names to signify His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and perfection, although both these kinds of names fail to express His mode of being, forasmuch as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in this life as He is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To signify <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> is to signify the "suppositum" with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or determined form in which it subsists. Hence, as some things are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a concrete sense, to signify His subsistence and perfection, so likewise nouns are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifying <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>. Further, verbs and participles which signify time, are applied to Him because His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> includes all time. For as we can apprehend and signify simple subsistences only by way of compound things, so we can understand and express simple <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> only by way of temporal things, because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> affinity to compound and temporal things. But demonstrative pronouns are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as describing what is understood, not what is sensed. For we can only describe Him as far as we understand Him. Thus, according as nouns, participles and demonstrative pronouns are applicable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far can He be signified by relative pronouns.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether any name can be applied to God substantially?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no name can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> substantially. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i, 9): "Everything said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies not His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but rather shows forth what He is not; or expresses some relation, or something following from His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or operation."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i): "You will find a chorus of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> addressed to the end of distinguishing clearly and praiseworthily the divine processions in the denomination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Thus the names applied by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> in praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are distinguished according to the divine processions themselves. But what expresses the procession of anything, does not signify its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore the names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not said of Him substantially.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing is named by us according as we understand it. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not understood by us in this life in His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Therefore neither is any name we can use applied substantially to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vi): "The being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the being strong, or the being wise, or whatever else we may say of that simplicity whereby His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is signified." Therefore all names of this kind signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Negative names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or signifying His relation to creatures manifestly do not at all signify His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but rather express the distance of the creature from Him, or His relation to something else, or rather, the relation of creatures to Himself.

<p>But as regards absolute and affirmative names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," "wise," and the like, various and many opinions have been given. For some have said that all such names, although they are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> affirmatively, nevertheless have been brought into use more to express some remotion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rather than to express anything that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> positively in Him. Hence they assert that when we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lives, we mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not like an inanimate thing; and the same in like manner applies to other names; and this was taught by <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Rabbi Moses</a>. Others say that these names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signify His relationship towards creatures: thus in the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," we mean, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in things; and the same rule applies to other names.

<p>Both of these opinions, however, seem to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> for three reasons.

<p>First because in neither of them can a reason be assigned why some names more than others are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He is assuredly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bodies in the same way as He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; therefore if the words "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," signified no more than, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things," it might in like manner be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a body, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of bodies. So also to say that He is a body implies that He is not a mere <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, as is primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>Secondly, because it would follow that all names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be said of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense, as healthy is secondarily said of medicine, forasmuch as it signifies only the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the health in the animal which primarily is called healthy.

<p>Thirdly, because this is against the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of those who speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lives, they assuredly mean more than to say the He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our life, or that He differs from inanimate bodies.

<p>Therefore we must hold a different doctrine--viz. that these names signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and are predicated substantially of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they fall short of a full representation of Him. Which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. For these names express <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Now since our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him as far as creatures represent Him. Now it is shown above (Question 4, Article 2) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prepossesses in Himself all the perfections of creatures, being Himself simply and universally perfect. Hence every creature represents Him, and is like Him so far as it possesses some perfection; yet it represents Him not as something of the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or genus, but as the excelling principle of whose form the effects fall short, although they derive some kind of likeness thereto, even as the forms of inferior bodies represent the power of the sun. This was explained above (Question 4, Article 3), in treating of the divine perfection. Therefore the aforesaid names signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but in an imperfect manner, even as creatures represent it imperfectly. So when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," the meaning is not, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>," or "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>"; but the meaning is, "Whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we attribute to creatures, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and in a more excellent and higher way. Hence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; but rather, on the contrary, He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in things because He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; according to what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), "Because He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, we are."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says that these names do not signify what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, forasmuch as by none of these names is perfectly expressed what He is; but each one signifies Him in an imperfect manner, even as creatures represent Him imperfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the significance of names, that from which the name is derived is different sometimes from what it is intended to signify, as for instance, this name "stone" [lapis] is imposed from the fact that it hurts the foot [loedit pedem], but it is not imposed to signify that which hurts the foot, but rather to signify a certain kind of body; otherwise everything that hurts the foot would be a stone [This refers to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> etymology of the word "lapis" which has no place in <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English</a>]. So we must say that these kinds of divine names are imposed from the divine processions; for as according to the diverse processions of their perfections, creatures are the representations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although in an imperfect manner; so likewise our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and names <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to each kind of procession; but nevertheless these names are not imposed to signify the procession themselves, as if when we say "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lives," the sense were, "life proceeds from Him"; but to signify the principle itself of things, in so far as life pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in Him, although it pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in Him in a more eminent way than can be understood or signified.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> We cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, as He really is in Himself; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him accordingly as He is represented in the perfections of creatures; and thus the names imposed by us signify Him in that manner only.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether any name can be applied to God in its literal sense?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that no name is applied literally to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For all names which we apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are taken from creatures; as was explained above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But the names of creatures are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically, as when we say, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a stone, or a lion, or the like. Therefore names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a metaphorical sense.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no name can be applied literally to anything if it should be withheld from it rather than given to it. But all such names as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," "wise," and the like are more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> withheld from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than given to Him; as appears from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ii). Therefore none of these names belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their literal sense.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, corporeal names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a metaphorical sense only; since He is incorporeal. But all such names imply some kind of corporeal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; for their meaning is bound up with time and composition and like corporeal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Therefore all these names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a metaphorical sense.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide ii), "Some names there are which express evidently the property of the divinity, and some which express the clear <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine majesty, but others there are which are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically by way of similitude." Therefore not all names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a metaphorical sense, but there are some which are said of Him in their literal sense.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the preceding article, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is derived from the perfections which flow from Him to creatures, which perfections are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a more eminent way than in creatures. Now our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends them as they are in creatures, and as it apprehends them it signifies them by names. Therefore as to the names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--viz. the perfections which they signify, such as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, life and the like, and their mode of signification. As regards what is signified by these names, they belong properly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and more properly than they belong to creatures, and are applied primarily to Him. But as regards their mode of signification, they do not properly and strictly apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for their mode of signification applies to creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There are some names which signify these perfections flowing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures in such a way that the imperfect way in which creatures receive the divine perfection is part of the very signification of the name itself as "stone" signifies a material being, and names of this kind can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in a metaphorical sense. Other names, however, express these perfections absolutely, without any such mode of participation being part of their signification as the words "being," "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," "living," and the like, and such names can be literally applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Such names as these, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> shows, are denied of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the reason that what the name signifies does not belong to Him in the ordinary sense of its signification, but in a more eminent way. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says also that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above all <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and all life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These names which are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> literally imply corporeal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> not in the thing signified, but as regards their mode of signification; whereas those which are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> metaphorically imply and mean a corporeal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in the thing signified.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether names applied to God are synonymous?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that these names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are synonymous names. For synonymous names are those which mean exactly the same. But these names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> mean entirely the same thing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and likewise it is His wisdom. Therefore these names are entirely synonymous.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if it be said these names signify one and the same thing in reality, but differ in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, it can be objected that an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to which no reality corresponds is a vain notion. Therefore if these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are many, and the thing is one, it seems also that all these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are vain notions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing which is one in reality and in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, is more one than what is one in reality and many in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is supremely one. Therefore it seems that He is not one in reality and many in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; and thus the names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do not signify different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; and thus they are synonymous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All synonyms united with each other are redundant, as when we say, "vesture clothing." Therefore if all names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are synonymous, we cannot properly say "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" or the like, and yet it is written, "O most mighty, great and powerful, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is Thy name" (<a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse18">Jeremiah 32:18</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> These names spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not synonymous. This would be easy to understand, if we said that these names are used to remove, or to express the relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to creatures; for thus it would follow that there are different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> as regards the diverse things denied of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or as regards diverse effects connoted. But even according to what was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), that these names signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, although in an imperfect manner, it is also clear from what has been said (1,2) that they have diverse meanings. For the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> signified by the name is the conception in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the thing signified by the name. But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures, in order to understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forms conceptions proportional to the perfections flowing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures, which perfections pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unitedly and simply, whereas in creatures they are received and divided and multiplied. As therefore, to the different perfections of creatures, there corresponds one simple principle represented by different perfections of creatures in a various and manifold manner, so also to the various and multiplied conceptions of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there corresponds one altogether simple principle, according to these conceptions, imperfectly understood. Therefore although the names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signify one thing, still because they signify that under many and different aspects, they are not synonymous.

<p>Thus appears the solution of the First Objection, since synonymous terms signify one thing under one aspect; for words which signify different aspects of one things, do not signify primarily and absolutely one thing; because the term only signifies the thing through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception, as was said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The many aspects of these names are not empty and vain, for there corresponds to all of them one simple reality represented by them in a manifold and imperfect manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The perfect unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires that what are manifold and divided in others should <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him simply and unitedly. Thus it comes about that He is one in reality, and yet multiple in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends Him in a manifold manner, as things represent Him.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether what is said of God and of creatures is univocally predicated of them?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the things attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures are univocal. For every equivocal term is reduced to the univocal, as many are reduced to one; for if the name "dog" be said equivocally of the barking dog, and of the dogfish, it must be said of some univocally--viz. of all barking dogs; otherwise we proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a>. Now there are some univocal agents which agree with their effects in name and definition, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> generates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and there are some agents which are equivocal, as the sun which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> heat, although the sun is hot only in an equivocal sense. Therefore it seems that the first agent to which all other agents are reduced, is an univocal agent: and thus what is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures, is predicated univocally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, there is no similitude among equivocal things. Therefore as creatures have a certain likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the word of <a href="../bible/gen000.htm">Genesis</a> (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>), "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness," it seems that something can be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures univocally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, measure is homogeneous with the thing measured. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first measure of all beings. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is homogeneous with creatures; and thus a word may be applied univocally to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to creatures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> whatever is predicated of various things under the same name but not in the same sense, is predicated equivocally. But no name belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same sense that it belongs to creatures; for instance, wisdom in creatures is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, but not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now a different genus changes an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, since the genus is part of the definition; and the same applies to other things. Therefore whatever is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of creatures is predicated equivocally.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more distant from creatures than any creatures are from each other. But the distance of some creatures makes any univocal predication of them impossible, as in the case of those things which are not in the same genus. Therefore much less can anything be predicated univocally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures; and so only equivocal predication can be applied to them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Univocal predication is impossible between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures. The reason of this is that every effect which is not an adequate result of the power of the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, receives the similitude of the agent not in its full degree, but in a measure that falls short, so that what is divided and multiplied in the effects resides in the agent simply, and in the same manner; as for example the sun by exercise of its one power produces manifold and various forms in all inferior things. In the same way, as said in the preceding article, all perfections <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in creatures divided and multiplied, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unitedly. Thus when any term expressing perfection is applied to a creature, it signifies that perfection distinct in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> from other perfections; as, for instance, by the term "wise" applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we signify some perfection distinct from a man's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and distinct from his power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and from all similar things; whereas when we apply to it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we do not mean to signify anything distinct from His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or power, or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Thus also this term "wise" applied to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in some degree circumscribes and comprehends the thing signified; whereas this is not the case when it is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it leaves the thing signified as incomprehended, and as exceeding the signification of the name. Hence it is evident that this term "wise" is not applied in the same way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The same rule applies to other terms. Hence no name is predicated univocally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of creatures.
<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An aureole is not due to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The reason of this is that an aureole, properly speaking, corresponds to some perfection of surpassing <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now those things which make for perfect <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are connatural to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or belong to their state in general, or to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have not an aureole in the same sense as an aureole is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p>Neither, on the other hand, are names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures in a purely equivocal sense, as some have said. Because if that were so, it follows that from creatures nothing could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or demonstrated about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at all; for the reasoning would always be exposed to the fallacy of equivocation. Such a view is against the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> many things about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also against what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made" (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>). Therefore it must be said that these names are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures in an analogous sense, i.e. according to proportion.

<p>Now names are thus used in two ways: either according as many things are proportionate to one, thus for example "healthy" predicated of medicine and urine in relation and in proportion to health of a body, of which the former is the sign and the latter the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: or according as one thing is proportionate to another, thus "healthy" is said of medicine and animal, since medicine is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health in the animal body. And in this way some things are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>, and not in a purely equivocal nor in a purely univocal sense. For we can name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only from creatures (1). Thus whatever is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures, is said according to the relation of a creature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its principle and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, wherein all perfections of things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> excellently. Now this mode of community of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is a mean between pure equivocation and simple univocation. For in analogies the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is not, as it is in univocals, one and the same, yet it is not totally diverse as in equivocals; but a term which is thus used in a multiple sense signifies various proportions to some one thing; thus "healthy" applied to urine signifies the sign of animal health, and applied to medicine signifies the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the same health.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as for instance the sun is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the generation of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> (otherwise it would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of itself, since it is contained in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>), but is a particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> which it places under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by way of participation. Therefore the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not an univocal agent; and the universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> comes before the particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogical</a> predication, which is being.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The likeness of the creature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is imperfect, for it does not represent one and the same generic thing (4, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the measure proportioned to things measured; hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures should be in the same genus.

<p>The arguments adduced in the contrary sense <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> indeed that these names are not predicated univocally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures; yet they do not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that they are predicated equivocally.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether names predicated of God are predicated primarily of creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that names are predicated primarily of creatures rather than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we name anything accordingly as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, since "names", as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says, "are signs of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>." But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> creatures before we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the names imposed by us are predicated primarily of creatures rather than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i): "We name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creatures." But names transferred from creatures to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are said primarily of creatures rather than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as "lion," "stone," and the like. Therefore all names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures are applied primarily to creatures rather than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all names equally applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures, are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all creatures, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (De Mystica Theol.). But what is applied to anything through its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is applied to it secondarily, for "healthy" is primarily predicated of animal rather than of medicine, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health. Therefore these names are said primarily of creatures rather than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written, "I <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bow my knees</a> to the Father, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, of Whom all paternity in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth is named" (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse14">Ephesians 3:14-15</a>); and the same applies to the other names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures. Therefore these names are applied primarily to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than to creatures.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In names predicated of many in an analogical sense, all are predicated because they have reference to some one thing; and this one thing must be placed in the definition of them all. And since that expressed by the name is the definition, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iv), such a name must be applied primarily to that which is put in the definition of such other things, and secondarily to these others according as they approach more or less to that first. Thus, for instance, "healthy" applied to animals comes into the definition of "healthy" applied to medicine, which is called healthy as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health in the animal; and also into the definition of "healthy" which is applied to urine, which is called healthy in so far as it is the sign of the animal's health. Thus all names applied metaphorically to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are applied to creatures primarily rather than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because when said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they mean only similitudes to such creatures. For as "smiling" applied to a field means only that the field in the beauty of its flowering is like the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> smile by proportionate likeness, so the name of "lion" applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> means only that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> manifests strength in His works, as a lion in his. Thus it is clear that applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the signification of names can be defined only from what is said of creatures. But to other names not applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a metaphorical sense, the same rule would apply if they were spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only, as some have supposed. For when it is said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," it would then only mean "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the creature's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>"; thus the term <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would included in its meaning the creature's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" would apply primarily to creatures rather than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as was shown above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), these names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only, but also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. For the words, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," or "wise," signify not only that He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of wisdom or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but that these <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in Him in a more excellent way. Hence as regards what the name signifies, these names are applied primarily to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than to creatures, because these perfections flow from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures; but as regards the imposition of the names, they are primarily applied by us to creatures which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> first. Hence they have a mode of signification which belongs to creatures, as said above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection refers to the imposition of the name.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same rule does not apply to metaphorical and to other names, as said above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This objection would be valid if these names were applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only as <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and not also <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, for instance as "healthy" is applied to medicine.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that names which imply relation to creatures are not predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally. For all such names signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as is universally held. Hence also <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Fide i) that this name "Lord" is the name of power, which is the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; and "Creator" signifies the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Now the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is not temporal, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore these names are not applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that to which something applies temporally can be described as made; for what is white temporally is made white. But to make does no apply to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore nothing can be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if any names are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally as implying relation to creatures, the same rule holds good of all things that imply relation to creatures. But some names are spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implying relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; for from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and loved the creature, according to the word: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love" (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 31:3</a>). Therefore also other names implying relation to creatures, as "Lord" and "Creator," are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, names of this kind signify relation. Therefore that relation must be something in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in the creature only. But it cannot be that it is something in the creature only, for in that case <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be called "Lord" from the opposite relation which is in creatures; and nothing is named from its opposite. Therefore the relation must be something in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also. But nothing temporal can be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is above time. Therefore these names are not applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, a thing is called relative from relation; for instance lord from lordship, as white from whiteness. Therefore if the relation of lordship is not really in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not really Lord, which is plainly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, in relative things which are not simultaneous in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, one can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without the other; as a thing knowable can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Praedic. v). But relative things which are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures are not simultaneous in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore a relation can be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the creature even without the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the creature; and thus these names "Lord" and "Creator" are predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and not temporally.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v) that this relative appellation "Lord" is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The names which import relation to creatures are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally, and not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<p>To see this we must learn that some have said that relation is not a reality, but only an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But this is plainly seen to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> from the very fact that things themselves have a mutual <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order and habitude. Nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that since relation has two extremes, it happens in three ways that a relation is real or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>. Sometimes from both extremes it is an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> only, as when mutual order or habitude can only go between things in the apprehension of reason; as when we say a thing "the same as itself." For reason apprehending one thing twice regards it as two; thus it apprehends a certain habitude of a thing to itself. And the same applies to relations between "being" and "non-being" formed by reason, apprehending "non-being" as an extreme. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of relations that follow upon an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as genus and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and the like.

<p>Now there are other relations which are realities as regards both extremes, as when for instance a habitude <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> between two things according to some reality that belongs to both; as is clear of all relations, consequent upon <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>; as great and small, double and half, and the like; for <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in both extremes: and the same applies to relations consequent upon action and passion, as motive power and the movable thing, father and son, and the like.

<p>Again, sometimes a relation in one extreme may be a reality, while in the other extreme it is an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> only; and this happens whenever two extremes are not of one order; as sense and science refer respectively to sensible things and to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> things; which, inasmuch as they are realities <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are outside the order of sensible and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Therefore in science and in sense a real relation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, because they are ordered either to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or to the sensible perception of things; whereas the things looked at in themselves are outside this order, and hence in them there is no real relation to science and sense, but only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends them as terms of the relations of science and sense. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v) that they are called relative, not forasmuch as they are related to other things, but as others are related to them. Likewise for instance, "on the right" is not applied to a column, unless it stands as regards an animal on the right side; which relation is not really in the column, but in the animal.

<p>Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is outside the whole order of creation, and all creatures are ordered to Him, and not conversely, it is manifest that creatures are really related to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; whereas in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no real relation to creatures, but a relation only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, inasmuch as creatures are referred to Him. Thus there is nothing to prevent these names which import relation to the creature from being predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally, not by reason of any change in Him, but by reason of the change of the creature; as a column is on the right of an animal, without change in itself, but by change in the animal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Some relative names are imposed to signify the relative habitudes themselves, as "master" and "servant," "father," and "son," and the like, and these relatives are called predicamental [secundum esse]. But others are imposed to signify the things from which ensue certain habitudes, as the mover and the thing moved, the head and the thing that has a head, and the like: and these relatives are called transcendental [secundum dici]. Thus, there is the same two-fold difference in divine names. For some signify the habitude itself to the creature, as "Lord," and these do not signify the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> directly, but indirectly, in so far as they presuppose the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; as dominion presupposes power, which is the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Others signify the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> directly, and consequently the corresponding habitudes, as "Saviour," "Creator," and suchlike; and these signify the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Yet both names are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporarily so far as they imply a habitude either principally or consequently, but not as signifying the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, either directly or indirectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As relations applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally are only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, so, "to become" or "to be made" are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, with no change in Him, as for instance when we say, "Lord, Thou art become [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'hast been'] our refuge" (<a href="../bible/psa089.htm#verse1">Psalm 89:1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in the operator, therefore names signifying relations following upon the action of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or will, are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; whereas those following upon the actions proceeding according to our mode of thinking to external effects are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally, as "Saviour," "Creator," and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Relations signified by these names which are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> temporally, are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; but the opposite relations in creatures are real. Nor is it incongruous that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be denominated from relations really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the thing, yet so that the opposite relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should also be understood by us at the same time; in the sense that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is spoken of relatively to the creature, inasmuch as the creature is related to Him: thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v) that the object is said to be knowable relatively because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> relates to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is related to the creature for the reason that the creature is related to Him: and since the relation of subjection is real in the creature, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Lord not in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> only, but in reality; for He is called Lord according to the manner in which the creature is subject to Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether relations are simultaneous by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or otherwise, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or otherwise of things to which they belong but the meaning of the relations themselves. For if one in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> includes another, and vice versa, then they are simultaneous by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: as double and half, father and son, and the like. But if one in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> includes another, and not vice versa, they are not simultaneous by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This applies to science and its object; for the object knowable is considered as a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, and the science as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, or as an act. Hence the knowable object in its mode of signification <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> before science, but if the same object is considered in act, then it is simultaneous with science in act; for the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is nothing as such unless it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Thus, though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is prior to the creature, still because the signification of Lord includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a servant and vice versa, these two relative terms, "Lord" and "servant," are simultaneous by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not "Lord" until He had a creature subject to Himself.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether this name "God" is a name of the nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this name, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," is not a name of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. 1) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <em>Theos</em> is so called from the <em>theein</em> [which means to care of] and to cherish all things; or from the <em>aithein</em>, that is to burn, for our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a fire consuming all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; or from <em>theasthai</em>, which means to consider all things." But all these names belong to operation. Therefore this name "God" signifies His operation and not His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a thing is named by us as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. But the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unknown to us. Therefore this name "God" does not signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Fide i) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is a name of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whence a name is imposed, and what the name signifies are not always the same thing. For as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> from its properties and operations, so we name <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> sometimes for its operation, or its property; e.g. we name the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of a stone from its act, as for instance that it hurts the foot [loedit pedem]; but still this name is not meant to signify the particular action, but the stone's <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. The things, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us in themselves, such as heat, cold, whiteness and the like, are not named from other things. Hence as regards such things the meaning of the name and its source are the same.

<p>Because therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us in His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us from His operations or effects, we name Him from these, as said in 1; hence this name "God" is a name of operation so far as relates to the source of its meaning. For this name is imposed from His universal <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things; since all who speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intend to name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as exercising <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all; hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ii), "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Deity</a> watches over all with perfect <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>." But taken from this operation, this name "God" is imposed to signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All that <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says refers to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; which is the source of the signification of the name "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We can name a thing according to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we have of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from its properties and effects. Hence because we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what stone is in itself from its property, this name "stone" signifies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the stone itself; for it signifies the definition of stone, by which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is, for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which the name signifies is the definition, as is said in Metaph. iv. Now from the divine effects we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in itself, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is; but only by way of eminence, and by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, and of negation as stated above (Question 12, Article 12). Thus the name "God" signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for this name was imposed to signify something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> above all things, the principle of all things and removed from all things; for those who name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intend to signify all this.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether this name "God" is communicable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this name "God" is communicable. For whosoever shares in the thing signified by a name shares in the name itself. But this name "God" signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is communicable to others, according to the words, "He hath given us great [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'most great'] and precious promises, that by these we [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'ye'] may be made <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">partakers of the divine nature</a>" (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2 Peter 1:4</a>). Therefore this name "God" can be communicated to others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, only proper names are not communicable. Now this name "God" is not a proper, but an appellative noun; which appears from the fact that it has a plural, according to the text, "I have said, You are gods" (<a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse6">Psalm 81:6</a>). Therefore this name "God" is communicable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, this name "God" comes from operation, as explained. But other names given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from His operations or effects are communicable; as "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," "wise," and the like. Therefore this name "God" is communicable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "They gave the incommunicable name to wood and stones" (<a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse21">Wisdom 14:21</a>), in reference to the divine name. Therefore this name "God" is incommunicable.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A name is communicable in two ways: properly, and by similitude. It is properly communicable in the sense that its whole signification can be given to many; by similitude it is communicable according to some part of the signification of the name. For instance this name "lion" is properly communicable to all things of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as "lion"; by similitude it is communicable to those who participate in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a lion, as for instance by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, or strength, and those who thus participate are called lions metaphorically. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, what names are properly communicable, we must consider that every form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the singular subject, by which it is individualized, is common to many either in reality, or in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is common to many in reality, and in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the sun is not common to many in reality, but only in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the sun can be understood as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in many subjects; and the reason is because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by abstraction from the singular. Hence to be in one singular subject or in many is outside the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. So, given the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it can be understood as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in many. But the singular, from the fact that it is singular, is divided off from all others. Hence every name imposed to signify any singular thing is incommunicable both in reality and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; for the plurality of this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing cannot be; nor can it be conceived in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Hence no name signifying any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing is properly communicable to many, but only by way of similitude; as for instance a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be called "Achilles" metaphorically, forasmuch as he may possess something of the properties of Achilles, such as strength. On the other hand, forms which are individualized not by any "suppositum," but by and of themselves, as being subsisting forms, if understood as they are in themselves, could not be communicable either in reality or in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; but only perhaps by way of similitude, as was said of individuals. Forasmuch as we are unable to understand simple self-subsisting forms as they really are, we understand them as compound things having forms in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; therefore, as was said in the first article, we give them concrete names signifying a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in some "suppositum." Hence, so far as concerns images, the same rules apply to names we impose to signify the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of compound things as to names given to us to signify simple subsisting <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p>Since, then, this name "God" is given to signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), and since the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be multiplied as shown above (Question 11, Article 3), it follows that this name "God" is incommunicable in reality, but communicable in opinion; just in the same way as this name "sun" would be communicable according to the opinion of those who say there are many suns. Therefore, it is written: "You served them who by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are not gods," (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse8">Galatians 4:8</a>), and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "Gods not in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion." Nevertheless this name "God" is communicable, not in its whole signification, but in some part of it by way of similitude; so that those are called gods who share in divinity by likeness, according to the text, "I have said, You are gods" (<a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse6">Psalm 81:6</a>).

<p>But if any name were given to signify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not as to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but as to His "suppositum," accordingly as He is considered as "this something," that name would be absolutely incommunicable; as, for instance, perhaps the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Tetragrammaton</a> among the Hebrew; and this is like giving a name to the sun as signifying this <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is only communicable according to the participation of some similitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This name "God" is an appellative name, and not a proper name, for it signifies the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the possessor; although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself in reality is neither universal nor particular. For names do not follow upon the mode of being in things, but upon the mode of being as it is in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. And yet it is incommunicable according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the thing, as was said above concerning the name "sun."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These names "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," "wise," and the like, are imposed from the perfections proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures; but they do not signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but rather signify the perfections themselves absolutely; and therefore they are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> communicable to many. But this name "God" is given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from His own proper operation, which we experience continually, to signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether this name "God" is applied to God univocally by nature, by participation, and according to opinion?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this name "God" is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> univocally by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by participation, and according to opinion. For where a diverse signification <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, there is no contradiction of affirmation and negation; for equivocation prevents contradiction. But a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who says: "An <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," contradicts a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> who says: "An <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <em>GOD</em> in both senses is spoken of univocally.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in opinion, and not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so the enjoyment of carnal pleasures is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in opinion, and not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But this name "beatitude" is applied univocally to this supposed <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and also to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore also this name "God" is applied univocally to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also in opinion.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, names are called univocal because they contain one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Now when a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> says: "There is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," he understands by the name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> being, and one venerated above all; while the heathen understands the same when he says: "An <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore this name "God" is applied univocally to both.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the likeness of what is in the thing as is said in Peri Herm. i. But the word "animal" applied to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> animal, and to a picture of one, is equivocal. Therefore this name "God" applied to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in opinion is applied equivocally.

<p>Further, No one can signify what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But the heathen does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. So when he says an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he does not signify the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Deity. On the other hand, A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> signifies the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Deity when he says that there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore this name "God" is not applied univocally, but equivocally to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to opinion.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This name "God" in the three aforesaid significations is taken neither univocally nor equivocally, but <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>. This is apparent from this reason: Univocal terms mean absolutely the same thing, but equivocal terms absolutely different; whereas in analogical terms a word taken in one signification must be placed in the definition of the same word taken in other senses; as, for instance, "being" which is applied to "<a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>" is placed in the definition of being as applied to "<a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>"; and "healthy" applied to animal is placed in the definition of healthy as applied to urine and medicine. For urine is the sign of health in the animal, and medicine is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health.

<p>The same applies to the question at issue. For this name "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as signifying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, includes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when it is used to denote <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in opinion, or participation. For when we name anyone god by participation, we understand by the name of god some likeness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Likewise, when we call an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> god, by this name god we understand and signify something which men think is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; thus it is manifest that the name has different meanings, but that one of them is comprised in the other significations. Hence it is manifestly said <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The multiplication of names does not depend on the predication of the name, but on the signification: for this name "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," of whomsoever it is predicated, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, is predicated in one sense. But it would be multiplied if by the name "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" we meant to signify different things; for instance, if one meant to signify by this name "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> really is, and another meant to signify by the same name a stone, or something else. Hence it is evident that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> saying that an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contradicts the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> asserting that it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because each of them uses this name GOD to signify the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> says an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he does not use this name as meaning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in opinion, for he would then speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as also <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sometimes use the name in the sense, as in the Psalm, "All the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa095.htm#verse5">Psalm 95:5</a>).

<p>The same remark applies to the Second and Third Objections. For these reasons proceed from the different predication of the name, and not from its various significations.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The term "animal" applied to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and a pictured animal is not purely equivocal; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> takes equivocal names in a large sense, including analogous names; because also being, which is predicated <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>, is sometimes said to be predicated equivocally of different predicaments.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Neither a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as it is in itself; but each one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it according to some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, or excellence, or remotion (12, 12). So a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> can take this name "God" in the same way when he says an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> does in saying an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if anyone should be quite <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> altogether, he could not even name Him, unless, perhaps, as we use names the meaning of which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether this name, HE WHO IS, is the most proper name of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that this name HE WHO IS is not the most proper name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this name "God" is an incommunicable name. But this name HE WHO IS, is not an incommunicable name. Therefore this name HE WHO IS is not the most proper name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iii) that "the name of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> excellently manifests all the processions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But it especially belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the universal principle of all things. Therefore this name "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is supremely proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not this name HE WHO IS.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every divine name seems to imply relation to creatures, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us only through creatures. But this name HE WHO IS imports no relation to creatures. Therefore this name HE WHO IS is not the most applicable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written that when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> asked, "If they should say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?" The Lord answered him, "Thus shalt thou say to them, HE WHO IS hath sent me to you" (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse13">Exodus 3:13-14</a>). Therefore this name HE WHO IS most properly belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This name HE WHO IS is most properly applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for three reasons:

<p>First, because of its signification. For it does not signify form, but simply <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself. Hence since the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself, which can be said of no other (3, 4), it is clear that among other names this one specially denominates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for everything is denominated by its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>Secondly, on account of its universality. For all other names are either less universal, or, if convertible with it, add something above it at least in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; hence in a certain way they inform and determine it. Now our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> itself in this life, as it is in itself, but whatever mode it applies in determining what it understands about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it falls short of the mode of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in Himself. Therefore the less determinate the names are, and the more universal and absolute they are, the more properly they are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. i) that, "HE WHO IS, is the principal of all names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for comprehending all in itself, it contains <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself as an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and indeterminate sea of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>." Now by any other name some mode of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is determined, whereas this name HE WHO IS, determines no mode of being, but is indeterminate to all; and therefore it denominates the "<a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> ocean of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>."

<p>Thirdly, from its consignification, for it signifies present <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and this above all properly applies to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not past or future, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. v).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This name HE WHO IS is the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more properly than this name "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as regards its source, namely, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and as regards the mode of signification and consignification, as said above. But as regards the object intended by the name, this name "God" is more proper, as it is imposed to signify the divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and still more proper is the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Tetragrammaton</a>, imposed to signify the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> itself, incommunicable and, if one may so speak, singular.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This name "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" is the principal name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as He is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but not absolutely; for <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> considered absolutely comes before the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that all the divine names should import relation to creatures, but it suffices that they be imposed from some perfections flowing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures. Among these the first is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, from which comes this name, HE WHO IS.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether affirmative propositions can be formed about God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that affirmative propositions cannot be formed about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. ii) that "negations about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but affirmations are vague."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Trin. ii) that "a simple form cannot be a subject." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the most absolutely simple form, as shown (3): therefore He cannot be a subject. But everything about which an affirmative proposition is made is taken as a subject. Therefore an affirmative proposition cannot be formed about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> which understands a thing otherwise than as it is. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> without any composition as shown above (Question 3, Article 7). Therefore since every affirmative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands something as compound, it follows that a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affirmative proposition about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be made.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But some affirmative propositions are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Three and One</a>; and that He is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affirmative propositions can be formed about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> affirmative propositions can be formed about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affirmative proposition the predicate and the subject signify in some way the same thing in reality, and different things in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. And this appears to be the case both in propositions which have an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> predicate, and in those which have an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> predicate. For it is manifest that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" and "white" are the same in subject, and different in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one thing, and that of whiteness is another. The same applies when I say, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is an animal"; since the same thing which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> animal; for in the same "suppositum" there is sensible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by reason of which he is called animal, and the rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by reason of which he is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; hence here again predicate and subject are the same as to "suppositum," but different as to <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. But in propositions where one same thing is predicated of itself, the same rule in some way applies, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> draws to the "suppositum" what it places in the subject; and what it places in the predicate it draws to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the form <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the "suppositum"; according to the saying that "predicates are to be taken formally, and subjects materially." To this diversity in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> corresponds the plurality of predicate and subject, while the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> signifies the identity of the thing by the composition itself.

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, as considered in Himself, is altogether one and simple, yet our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him by different conceptions because it cannot see Him as He is in Himself. Nevertheless, although it understands Him under different conceptions, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that one and the same simple object corresponds to its conceptions. Therefore the plurality of predicate and subject represents the plurality of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> represents the unity by composition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that the affirmations about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are vague or, according to another translation, "incongruous," inasmuch as no name can be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to its mode of signification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot comprehend simple subsisting forms, as they really are in themselves; but it apprehends them as compound things in which there is something taken as subject and something that is inherent. Therefore it apprehends the simple form as a subject, and attributes something else to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This proposition, "The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understanding anything otherwise than it is, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>," can be taken in two senses, accordingly as this adverb "otherwise" determines the word "understanding" on the part of the thing understood, or on the part of the one who understands. Taken as referring to the thing understood, the proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the meaning is: Any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which understands that the thing is otherwise than it is, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But this does not hold in the present case; because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when forming a proposition about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not affirm that He is composite, but that He is simple. But taken as referring to the one who understands, the proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in understanding is different from the mode of the thing in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Since it is clear that our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands material things below itself in an immaterial manner; not that it understands them to be immaterial things; but its manner of understanding is immaterial. Likewise, when it understands simple things above itself, it understands them according to its own mode, which is in a composite manner; yet not so as to understand them to be composite things. And thus our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in forming composition in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
