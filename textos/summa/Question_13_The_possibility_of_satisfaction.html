<h1>Question 13. The possibility of satisfaction</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5013.htm#article1"> Can man make satisfaction to God?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5013.htm#article2"> Can one man make satisfaction for another?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether man can make satisfaction to God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For satisfaction should balance the offense, as shown above (12, 2,3). But an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, since it is measured by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom it is committed, for it is a greater offense to strike a prince than anyone else. Therefore, as no action of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it seems that he cannot make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> cannot make compensation for a debt, since all that he has is his master's. But we are the slaves of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> we have, we owe to Him. Therefore, as satisfaction is compensation for a past offense, it seems that we cannot offer it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if all that a man has suffices not to pay one debt, he cannot pay another debt. Now all that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, all that he can do, and all that he has, does not suffice to pay what he owes for the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of creation, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse16">Isaiah 40:16</a>) that "the wood of Libanus shall not be enough for a burnt offering [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a> shall not be enough to burn, nor the beasts thereof for a burnt offering']." Therefore by no means can he make satisfaction for the debt resulting from the offense committed.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to spend all his time in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now time once lost cannot be recovered, wherefore, as Seneca observes (Lib. i, Ep. i, ad Lucilium) loss of time is a very grievous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot make compensation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the same conclusion follows as before.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, mortal actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. But none could satisfy for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> unless he were both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Neither, therefore, can he satisfy for actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Pelagius, Expos. Fidei ad Damasum] says: "Whoever maintains that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded anything impossible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." But satisfaction is commanded (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse8">Luke 3:8</a>): "Bring forth . . . fruits worthy of penance." Therefore it is possible to make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more merciful than any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But it is possible to make satisfaction to a man. Therefore it is possible to make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Further, there is due satisfaction when the punishment balances the fault, since "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is the same as counterpassion," as the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a> said [Aristotle, Ethic. v, 5; Cf. II-II, 61, 4]. Now punishment may equal the pleasure contained in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. Therefore satisfaction can be made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Man becomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> debtor in two ways; first, by reason of favors received, secondly, by reason of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed: and just as thanksgiving or worship or the like regard the debt for favors received, so satisfaction regards the debt for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. Now in giving <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to one's parents or to the gods, as indeed the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 14), it is impossible to repay them measure for measure, but it suffices that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> repay as much as he can, for friendship does not demand measure for measure, but what is possible. Yet even this is equal somewhat, viz. according to proportion, for as the debt due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, in comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can do, in comparison with himself, so that in another way the form of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is preserved. It is the same as regards satisfaction. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if "satis" [enough] denotes <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantitative</a> equality; but he can, if it denote proportionate equality, as explained above, and as this suffices for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so does it suffice for satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the offense derived a certain <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of the Divine majesty, so does satisfaction derive a certain <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of Divine mercy, in so far as it is quickened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby whatever <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to repay becomes acceptable. Others, however, say that the offense is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> as regards the aversion, and in this respect it is pardoned gratuitously, but that it is finite as turning to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in which respect it is possible to make satisfaction for it. But this is not to the point, since satisfaction does not answer to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except as this is an offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not of turning to a creature but of turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Others again say that even as regards the aversion it is possible to make satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in virtue of Christ's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, which was, in a way, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. And this comes to the same as what we said before, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to believers through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Mediator. If, however, He were to give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> otherwise, satisfaction would suffice in the way explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man, who was made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image, has a certain share of liberty, in so far as he is master of his actions through his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; so that, through acting by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, he can make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for though it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as it was bestowed on him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet it was freely bestowed on him, that he might be his own master, which cannot be said of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument proves that it is impossible to make equivalent satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not that it is impossible to make sufficient satisfaction to Him. For though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all that he is able to give Him, yet it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that he should actually do the whole of what he is able to do, for it is impossible for him, according to his present state of life, to put forth his whole power into any one single thing, since he has to be heedful about many things. And so his conduct is subject to a certain measure, viz. the fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments, over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot recover the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that is past, he can in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that follows make compensation for what he should have done in the past, since the commandment did not exact from him the fulfillment of his whole power, as stated above (ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has less of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has, yet it is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because it is an infection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself, so that, unlike actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether one man can fulfill satisfactory punishment for another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot fulfill satisfactory punishment for another. Because <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is requisite for satisfaction. Now one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit for another, since it is written (<a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse12">Psalm 61:12</a>): "Thou wilt render to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works." Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot make satisfaction for another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, satisfaction is condivided with <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession. But one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> or confess for another. Neither therefore can one make satisfaction for another.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for another one <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> also for oneself. If therefore a man can make satisfaction for another, he satisfies for himself by satisfying for another, so that if a man satisfy for another he need not make satisfaction for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if one can satisfy for another, as soon as he takes the debt of punishment on himself, this other is freed from his debt. Therefore the latter will go straight to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, if he die after the whole of his debt of punishment has been taken up by another; else, if he be punished all the same, a double punishment will be paid for the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, viz. by him who has begun to make satisfaction, and by him who is punished in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians 6:2</a>): "Bear ye one another's burdens." Therefore it seems that one can bear the burden of punishment laid upon another.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> avails more before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one can pay another's debt for love of him. Much more, therefore, can this be done before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Satisfactory punishment has a twofold purpose, viz. to pay the debt, and to serve as a remedy for the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly, as a remedy against future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the satisfaction of one does not profit another, for the flesh of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not tamed by another's fast; nor does one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquire the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of well-doing, through the actions of another, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as a man, by his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions, may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> an increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for another, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the most efficacious remedy for the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> rather than of satisfaction. on the other hand, as regards the payment of the debt, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can satisfy for another, provided he be in a state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, so that his works may avail for satisfaction. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he who satisfies for another should undergo a greater punishment than the principal would have to undergo (as some maintain, who argue that a man profits more by his own punishment than by another's), because punishment derives its power of satisfaction chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bears it. And since greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is evidenced by a man satisfying for another than for himself, less punishment is required of him who satisfies for another, than of the principal: wherefore we read in the Lives of the Fathers (v, 5) of one who for love of his brother did penance for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which his brother had not committed, and that on account of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> his brother was released from a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he had committed. Nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the one for whom satisfaction is made should be unable to make satisfaction himself, for even if he were able, he would be released from his debt when the other satisfied in his stead. But this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in so far as the satisfactory punishment is medicinal: so that a man is not to be allowed to do penance for another, unless there be evidence of some defect in the penitent, either bodily, so that he is unable to bear it, or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, so that he is not ready to undergo it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward is bestowed on a man according to his disposition, because the fulness of the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be according to the capacity of those who see Him. Wherefore just as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not disposed thereto by another's act, so one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward for another, unless his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> efficacy, as the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby children come to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. On the other hand, the temporal punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after the guilt has been forgiven is not measured according to the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom it is due, since sometimes the better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> owes a greater debt of punishment. Consequently one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> for another as regards release from punishment, and one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> act becomes another's, by means of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby we are "all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians 3:28</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Contrition is ordained against the guilt which affects a man's disposition to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, so that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not freed from guilt by another's <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. In like manner by confession a man submits to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: nor can one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> instead of another, since in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to the recipient, not to another. Consequently there is no comparison between satisfaction and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the payment of the debt we consider the measure of the punishment, whereas in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> we regard the root which is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: wherefore he that, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> for another, at least congruously, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> more for himself; yet he that satisfies for another does not also satisfy for himself, because the measure of the punishment does not suffice for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of both, although by satisfying for another he <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> something greater than the release from punishment, viz. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> If this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bound himself to undergo a certain punishment, he would not be released from the debt before paying it: wherefore he himself will suffer the punishment, as long as the other makes satisfaction for him: and if he do not this, then both are debtors in respect of fulfilling this punishment, one for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, the other for his <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a>, so that it does not follow that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is twice punished.
