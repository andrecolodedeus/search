<h1>Question 13. The power of Christ's soul</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4013.htm#article1"> Did He have omnipotence simply?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4013.htm#article2"> Did He have omnipotence with regard to corporeal creatures?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4013.htm#article3"> Did He have omnipotence with regard to His own body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4013.htm#article4"> Did He have omnipotence as regards the execution of His own will?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul of Christ had omnipotence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had omnipotence. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Gloss, Ord.] says on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse32">Luke 1:32</a>: "The power which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, the Man was about to receive in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>." Now this would seem to regard the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> principally, since it is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence since the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had omnipotence from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> received omnipotence in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, so is His <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in a manner had the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, as was said above (Question 10, Article 2). Therefore He had all power; and thus He was <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has all <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is either practical or speculative. Therefore He has a practical <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of what He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>, i.e. He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> how to do what He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a>; and thus it seems that He can do all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot belong to any creature. But it is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, according to <a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse2">Exodus 15:2-3</a>: "He is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and I will glorify Him," and further on, "Almighty is His name." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being a creature, has not omnipotence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (2, 1; 10, 1) in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the union in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so took place that there still remained the distinction of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> still retaining what belonged to it. Now the active principle of a thing follows its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, which is the principle of action. But the form is either the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, as in simple things; or is the constituent of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing; as in such as are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p>And it is in this way that omnipotence flows, so to say, from the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. For since the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is the very uncircumscribed Being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. v), it has an active power over everything that can have the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being; and this is to have omnipotence; just as every other thing has an active power over such things as the perfection of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> extends to; as what is hot gives heat. Therefore since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it cannot possibly have omnipotence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> By union with the Person, the Man receives omnipotence in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; the result of which union is that as the Man is said to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is He said to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; not that the omnipotence of the Man is distinct (as neither is His Godhead) from that of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but because there is one Person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to some, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and active power are not in the same ratio; for an active power flows from the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, inasmuch as action is considered to come forth from the agent; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not always possessed by the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or form of the knower, since it may be had by assimilation of the knower to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the aid of received <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But this reason seems not to suffice, because even as we may understand by a likeness obtained from another, so also may we act by a form obtained from another, as water or iron heats, by heat borrowed from fire. Hence there would be no reason why the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it can <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things by the similitudes of all things impressed upon it by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot do these things by the same similitudes.

<p>It has, therefore, to be further considered that what is received in the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from the higher is possessed in an inferior manner; for heat is not received by water in the perfection and strength it had in fire. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of an inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, the similitudes of things are not received in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the perfection and strength they had in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. And hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inferior to Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as regards the manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> (things) more perfectly than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ; and also as regards the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do, and these <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>; although it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> all things present, past, and future, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision. So, too, the similitudes of things infused into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not equal the Divine power in acting, i.e. so as to do all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do, or to do in the same manner as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does, Who acts with an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> might whereof the creature is not capable. Now there is no thing, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which in some way an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power is needed, although a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power; yet there are things which can be done only by an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, as creation and the like, as is plain from what has been said in I, 45. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which, being a creature, is finite in might, can <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, indeed, all things, but not in every way; yet it cannot do all things, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of omnipotence; and, amongst other things, it is clear it cannot create itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has practical and speculative <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>; yet it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should have practical <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of those things of which it has speculative <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>. Because for speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> a mere conformity or assimilation of the knower to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> suffices; whereas for practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it is required that the forms of the things in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> should be operative. Now to have a form and to impress this form upon something else is more than merely to have the form; as to be lightsome and to enlighten is more than merely to be lightsome. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has a speculative <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of creation (for it <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> the mode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creation), but it has no practical <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of this mode, since it has no <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> operative of creation.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the soul of Christ had omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures. For He Himself says (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18</a>): "All power is given to Me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth." Now by the words "<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth" are meant all creatures, as is plain from <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>: "In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the most perfect of all creatures. But every creature can be moved by another creature; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. iii, 4) that "even as the denser and lower bodies are ruled in a fixed way by the subtler and stronger bodies; so are all bodies by the spirit of life, and the irrational spirit of life by the rational spirit of life, and the truant and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> rational spirit of life by the rational, loyal, and righteous spirit of life." But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> moves even the highest spirits, enlightening them, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. vii). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had in its highest degree the "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>" or works of might. But every transmutation of the creature can belong to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; since even the heavenly bodies were <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> changed from their course, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> proves (Ep. ad Polycarp). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To transmute creatures belongs to Him Who preserves them. Now this belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a>: "Upholding all things by the word of His power." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone has omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures. Therefore this does not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two distinctions are here needed. of these the first is with respect to the transmutation of creatures, which is three-fold. The first is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, being brought about by the proper agent <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>; the second is <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, being brought about by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> agent above the wonted order and course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as to raise the dead; the third is inasmuch as every creature may be brought to nothing.

<p>The second distinction has to do with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which may be looked at in two ways: first in its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and with its power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; secondly, as it is the instrument of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, personally united to Him. Therefore if we speak of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and with its power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it had power to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those effects proper to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (e.g. to rule the body and direct <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, and also, by the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> to enlighten all rational creatures falling short of its perfection), in a manner befitting a rational creature. But if we speak of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as it is the instrument of the Word united to Him, it had an instrumental power to effect all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> transmutations ordainable to the end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, which is "to re-establish all things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth" [<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse10">Ephesians 1:10</a>]. But the transmutation of creatures, inasmuch as they may be brought to nothing, corresponds to their creation, whereby they were brought from nothing. And hence even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can create, so, too, He alone can bring creatures to nothing, and He alone upholds them in being, lest they fall back to nothing. And thus it must be said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (on the text quoted): "Power is given Him," i.e. to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "Who a little while before was crucified, buried in the tomb, and afterwards rose again." But power is said to have been given Him, by reason of the union whereby it was brought about that a Man was <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, as was said above (1, ad 1). And although this was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, yet after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12764a.htm">Remigius</a> says (cf. Catena Aurea). Now, "things are said to happen when they are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>" [<a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>: Qq. in Ep. ad Philip.]. Hence after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> says "that all power is given" to Him "in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although every creature is transmutable by some other creature, except, indeed, the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and even it can be enlightened by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; yet not every transmutation that can be made in a creature can be made by a creature; since some transmutations can be made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Yet all transmutations that can be made in creatures can be made by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the instrument of the Word, but not in its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and power, since some of these transmutations pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> neither in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor in the order of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was said in the II-II, 178, 1, ad 1, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of mighty works or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is given to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, so that these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought not by his own, but by Divine power. Now this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was bestowed on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> most excellently, i.e. not only that He might work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but also that He might communicate this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to others. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse1">Matthew 10:1</a>) that, "having called His twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> together, He gave them power over <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of diseases, and all manner of infirmities."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the soul of Christ had omnipotence with regard to His own body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had omnipotence with regard to His own body. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 20,23) that "all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; He willed to hunger, He willed to thirst, He willed to fear, He willed to die." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> because "He hath done all things whatsoever He would" (<a href="../bible/psa113.htm#verse11">Psalm 113:11</a>). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had omnipotence with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was more perfect in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, who had a body entirely subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that nothing could happen to the body against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--and this on account of the original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which it had in the state of innocence. Much more, therefore, had <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> omnipotence with regard to His body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the body is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> changed by the imaginations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and so much more changed, the stronger the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as was said in I, 117, 3, ad 3. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had most perfect strength as regards both the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the other powers. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> with regard to His own body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse17">Hebrews 2:17</a>) that "it behooved Him in all things to be made like unto His brethren," and especially as regards what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that the health of the body and its nourishment and growth are not subject to the bidding of reason or will, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone Who is the author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore they were not subject in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> with regard to His own body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be viewed in two ways. First, in its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and power; and in this way, as it was incapable of making exterior bodies swerve from the course and order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so, too, was it incapable of changing its own body from its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, has a determinate relation to its body. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be viewed as an instrument united in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Word; and thus every disposition of His own body was wholly subject to His power. Nevertheless, since the power of an action is not properly attributed to the instrument, but to the principal agent, this omnipotence is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saving of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> refers to the Divine will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since, as he says in the preceding chapter (De Fide Orth. xix, 14,15), it was by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was allowed to suffer and do what was proper to it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It was no part of the original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had in the state of innocence that a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should have the power of changing his own body to any form, but that it should keep it from any hurt. Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have assumed even this power if He had wished. But since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has three states--viz. innocence, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even as from the state of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He assumed comprehension and from the state of innocence, freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--so also from the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did He assume the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of being under the penalties of this life, as will be said (14, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> be strong, the body obeys <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> in some things, e.g. as regards falling from a beam set on high, since the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> was formed to be a principle of local motion, as is said De Anima iii, 9,10. So, too, as regards alteration in heat and cold, and their consequences; for the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherewith the heart is moved, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> follow the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and thus by commotion of the spirits the whole body is altered. But the other corporeal dispositions which have no <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relation to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> are not transmuted by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, however strong it is, e.g. the shape of the hand, or foot, or such like.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the soul of Christ had omnipotence as regards the execution of His will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not omnipotence as regards the execution of His own will. For it is written (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse24">Mark 7:24</a>) that "entering into a house, He would that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and He could not be hid." Therefore He could not carry out the purpose of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in all things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a command is a sign of will, as was said in I, 19, 12. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> commanded certain things to be done, and the contrary came to pass, for it is written (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse30">Matthew 9:30-31</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> strictly charged them whose eyes had been opened, saying: "See that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this. But they going out spread His fame abroad in all that country." Therefore He could not carry out the purpose of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in everything.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man does not ask from another for what he can do himself. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> besought the Father, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for what He wished to be done, for it is written (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke 6:12</a>): "He went out into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and He passed the whole night in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore He could not carry out the purpose of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in all things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. 77): "It is impossible for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Saviour not to be fulfilled: nor is it possible for Him to will what He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knows</a> ought not to come to pass."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> willed things in two ways. First, what was to be brought about by Himself; and it must be said that He was capable of whatever He willed thus, since it would not befit His wisdom if He willed to do anything of Himself that was not subject to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Secondly, He wished things to be brought about by the Divine power, as the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of His own body</a> and such like <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which He could not effect by His own power, except as the instrument of the Godhead, as was said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. 77): "What came to pass, this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> must be said to have willed. For it must be remarked that this happened in the country of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to whom it was not yet time to preach. Yet it would have been invidious not to welcome such as came spontaneously for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence He did not wish to be heralded by His own, and yet He wished to be sought; and so it came to pass." Or it may be said that this will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not with regard to what was to be carried out by it, but with regard to what was to be done by others, which did not come under His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. Hence in the letter of Pope Agatho, which was approved in the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth Council</a> [Third Council of Constantinople, Act. iv], we read: "When He, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> and Redeemer of all, wished to be hid and could not, must not this be referred only to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will which He deigned to assume in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xix), by the fact that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> charged His mighty works to be kept secret, He gave an example to His servants coming after Him that they should wish their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to be hidden; and yet, that others may profit by their example, they are made public against their will." And thus this command signified His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to fly from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse50">John 8:50</a>, "I seek not My own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>." Yet He wished absolutely, and especially by His Divine will, that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought should be published for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> both for things that were to be brought about by the Divine power, and for what He Himself was to do by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, since the power and operation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> depended on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, "Who works in all [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'you', both to will and to accomplish" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians 2:13</a>).
