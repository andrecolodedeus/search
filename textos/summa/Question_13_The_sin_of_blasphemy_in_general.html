<h1>Question 13. The sin of blasphemy, in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3013.htm#article1"> Is blasphemy opposed to the confession of faith?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3013.htm#article2"> Is blasphemy always a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3013.htm#article3"> Is blasphemy the most grievous sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3013.htm#article4"> Is blasphemy in the damned?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether blasphemy is opposed to the confession of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not opposed to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> is to utter an affront or insult against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. Now this pertains to ill-will against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than to unbelief. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not opposed to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse31">Ephesians 4:31</a>, "Let <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> . . . be put away from you," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says, "that which is committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>."

<p>But confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seemingly, is not about other things than those pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not always opposed to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to some, there are three kinds of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. The first of these is when something unfitting is affirmed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the second is when something fitting is denied of Him; and the third, when something proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ascribed to a creature, so that, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not only about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also about His creatures. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not opposed to confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 1:12-13</a>): "I . . . before was a blasphemer and a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a>," and afterwards, "I did it ignorantly in" my "unbelief." Hence it seems that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> pertains to unbelief.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> seems to denote the disparagement of some surpassing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, especially that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. i), is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Hence whatever befits <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pertains to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and whatever does not befit Him, is far removed from the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which is His Essence. Consequently whoever either denies anything befitting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or affirms anything unbefitting Him, disparages the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p>Now this may happen in two ways. On the first way it may happen merely in respect of the opinion in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; in the second way this opinion is united to a certain detestation in the affections, even as, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is perfected by love of Him. Accordingly this disparagement of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is either in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> alone, or in the affections also. If it is in thought only, it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the heart, whereas if it betrays itself outwardly in speech it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is opposed to confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He that speaks against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of reviling Him, disparages the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, not only in respect of the falsehood in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of his will, whereby he detests and strives to hinder the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is perfect <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is praised in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in so far as praise is given to the works which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, redound, as a consequence, against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Properly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not in this way divided into three <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: since to affirm unfitting things, or to deny fitting things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, differ merely as affirmation and negation. For this diversity does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> distinct <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, since the falsehood of affirmations and negations is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and it is the same <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in either way, since negatives are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by affirmatives, according to Poster. i, 25. Again to ascribe to creatures things that are proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seems to amount to the same as affirming something unfitting of Him, since whatever is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: and to ascribe to a creature, that which is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is to assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as a creature.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether blasphemy is always a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words, "Now lay you also all away," etc. (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse8">Colossians 3:8</a>) says: "After prohibiting greater crimes he forbids lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>": and yet among the latter he includes <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is comprised among the lesser, i.e. venial, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to one of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>. But, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not contrary to any of them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed without deliberation, are not mortal: hence first movements are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they precede the deliberation of the reason, as was shown above (I-II, 74, 3,10). Now <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> sometimes occurs without deliberation of the reason. Therefore it is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/lev024.htm#verse16">Leviticus 24:16</a>): "He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die." Now the death punishment is not inflicted except for a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 72, 5), a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is one whereby a man is severed from the first principle of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, which principle is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore whatever things are contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in respect of their genus. Now <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, as to its genus, is opposed to Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it disparages the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, which is the object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by reason of its genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> is not to be understood as meaning that all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which follow, are mortal, but that whereas all those mentioned previously are more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, some of those mentioned afterwards are less grievous; and yet among the latter some more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are included.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is contrary to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, its prohibition is comprised under the prohibition of unbelief, expressed by the words: "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," etc. (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse1">Exodus 20:1</a>). Or else, it is forbidden by the words: "Thou shalt not take the name of . . . <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain" (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus 20:7</a>). Because he who asserts something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, takes His name in vain even more than he who uses the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in confirmation of a falsehood.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There are two ways in which <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> may occur unawares and without deliberation. On the first way, by a man failing to advert to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his words, and this may happen through his being moved suddenly by passion so as to break out into words suggested by his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, without heeding to the meaning of those words: this is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is not a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> properly so called. On the second way, by adverting to the meaning of his words, and to their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: in which case he is not excused from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as neither is he who, in a sudden movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, kills one who is sitting beside him.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sin of blasphemy is the greatest sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion xii), a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because it does harm. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, since it destroys a man's life, does more harm than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, which can do no harm to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is more grievous than that of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a perjurer calls upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness to a falsehood, and thus seems to assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But not every blasphemer goes so far as to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore perjury is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on <a href="../bible/psa074.htm#verse6">Psalm 74:6</a>, "Lift not up your horn on high," a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "To excuse oneself for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all." Therefore <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> On <a href="../bible/isa018.htm#verse2">Isaiah 18:2</a>, "To a terrible people," etc. a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "In comparison with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is slight."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is opposed to the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that it contains the gravity of unbelief: while the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is aggravated if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will's</a> detestation is added thereto, and yet more, if it breaks out into words, even as love and confession add to the praise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Therefore, since, as stated above (Question 10, Article 3), unbelief is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in respect of its genus, it follows that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> also is a very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through belonging to the same genus as unbelief and being an aggravated form of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If we compare <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> as regards the objects of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed directly against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is more grave than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against one's neighbor. On the other hand, if we compare them in respect of the harm wrought by them, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> does more harm to one's neighbor, than <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> does to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, however, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, rather than on the effect of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, as was shown above (I-II, 73, 8), it follows that, as the blasphemer intends to do harm to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, absolutely speaking, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously that the murderer. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> takes precedence, as to punishment, among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against our neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on the words, "Let . . . <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> be put away from you" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse31">Ephesians 4:31</a>) says: "Blasphemy is worse than perjury." The reason is that the perjurer does not say or think something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the blasphemer does: but he calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness to a falsehood, not that he deems <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, but in the hope, as it were, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not testify to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by some evident sign.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To excuse oneself for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a circumstance that aggravates every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> itself: and it is called the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for as much as it makes every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more grievous.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the damned blaspheme?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the damned do not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. Because some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men are deterred from blaspheming now, on account of the fear of future punishment. But the damned are undergoing these punishments, so that they abhor them yet more. Therefore, much more are they restrained from blaspheming.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is most demeritorious. Now in the life to come there is no state of meriting or demeriting. Therefore there will be no place for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>) that "the tree . . . in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be": whence it clearly follows that, after this life, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acquires neither <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which he did not already possess in this life. Now many will be damned who were not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> in this life. Neither, therefore, will they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> in the life to come.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rev016.htm#verse9">Apocalypse 16:9</a>): "The men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who hath power over these plagues," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on these words says that "those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, though aware that they are deservedly punished, will nevertheless complain that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is so powerful as to torture them thus." Now this would be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in their present state: and consequently it will also be in their future state.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A1,3), detestation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Now those who are in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> retain their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will which is turned away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, since they love the things for which they are punished, would wish to use them if they could, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the punishments inflicted on them for those same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They regret indeed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have committed, not because they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, but because they are punished for them. Accordingly this detestation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is, in them, the interior <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the heart: and it is credible that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> they will <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the tongue, even as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will praise Him with their voices.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the present life men are deterred from <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> through fear of punishment which they think they can escape: whereas, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the damned have no hope of escape, so that, in <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, they are borne towards whatever their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will suggests to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Merit and demerit belong to the state of a wayfarer, wherefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in them, while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is demeritorious. On the blessed, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, but is part of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">blissful</a> reward, and, in like manner, in the damned, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not demeritorious, but is part of the punishment of damnation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whoever dies in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, bears with him a will that detests the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with regard to a certain thing, and in this respect there can be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in him.
