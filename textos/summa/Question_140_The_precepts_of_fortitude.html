<h1>Question 140. The precepts of fortitude</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3140.htm#article1"> The precepts of fortitude itself</a> <li><a href="../summa/3140.htm#article2"> The precepts of its parts</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the precepts of fortitude are suitably given in the Divine Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are not suitably given in the Divine Law. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contains precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm">Deuteronomy 20</a>). Therefore precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> should have been given in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, affirmative precepts are of greater import than negative precepts, since the affirmative include the negative, but not vice versa. Therefore it is unsuitable for the Divine Law to contain none but negative precepts in prohibition of fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is one of the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (123, 2; I-II, 61, 2). Now the precepts are directed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as to their end: wherefore they should be proportionate to them. Therefore the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> should have been placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, which are the chief precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> which contains these precepts.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are directed to the end intended by the lawgiver. Wherefore precepts of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must needs be framed in various ways according to the various ends intended by lawgivers, so that even in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs there are laws of democracies, others of kingdoms, and others again of tyrannical governments. Now the end of the Divine Law is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore the Divine Law contains precepts both of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, with a view to directing the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason it is written (<a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 20:3-4</a>): "Fear ye them not: because the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the midst of you, and will fight for you against your enemies."

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws, they are directed to certain earthly goods, and among them we find precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> according to the requirements of those goods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> contained temporal promises, while the promises of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Contra Faust. iv). Hence in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> there was need for the people to be taught how to fight, even in a bodily contest, in order to obtain an earthly possession. But in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> men were to be taught how to come to the possession of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> by fighting spiritually, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew 11:12</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> suffereth <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> bear it away." Hence Peter commands (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8-9</a>): "Your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as a roaring lion, goeth about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist ye, strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," as also <a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse7">James 4:7</a>: "Resist the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and he will fly from you." Since, however, men while tending to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods may be withdrawn from them by corporal dangers, precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> had to be given even in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a>, that they might bravely endure temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a>, "Fear ye not them that kill the body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> gives general directions in its precepts. But the things that have to be done in cases of danger are not, like the things to be avoided, reducible to some common thing. Hence the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are negative rather than affirmative.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (Question 122, Article 1), the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are placed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, as first principles, which need to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all from the outset. Wherefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> had to be chiefly about those acts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in which the notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is manifest, and not about acts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because it is not so evident that it is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> not to fear dangers of death.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the precepts of the parts of fortitude are suitably given in the Divine Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the precept of the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are unsuitably given in the Divine Law. For just as patience and perseverance are parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, so also are magnificence, magnanimity, and confidence, as stated above (128). Now we find precepts of patience in the Divine Law, as also of perseverance. Therefore there should also have been precepts of magnificence and magnanimity.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, patience is a very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is the guardian of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xxxv). Now the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are commanded absolutely. Therefore patience should not have been commanded merely, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i), as to the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, patience and perseverance are parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as stated above (128; 136, 4; 137, 2). Now the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are not affirmative but only negative, as stated above (1, ad 2). Therefore the precepts of patience and perseverance should have been negative and not affirmative.

<p>The contrary, however, follows from the way in which they are given by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Divine Law instructs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfectly about such things as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for right living. Now in order to live aright <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs not only the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but also the secondary and annexed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Wherefore the Divine Law contains precepts not only about the acts of the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but also about the acts of the secondary and annexed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Magnificence and magnanimity do not belong to the genus of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, except by reason of a certain excellence of greatness which they regard in their respective matters. Now things pertaining to excellence come under the counsels of perfection rather than under precepts of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Wherefore, there was need of counsels, rather than of precepts about magnificence and magnanimity. On the other hand, the hardships and toils of the present life pertain to patience and perseverance, not by reason of any greatness observable in them, but on account of the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence the need of precepts of patience and perseverance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 3, Article 2), although affirmative precepts are always binding, they are not binding for always, but according to place and time. Wherefore just as the affirmative precepts about the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are to be understood as to the preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in the sense that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be prepared to fulfil them when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, so too are the precepts of patience to be understood in the same way.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Fortitude, as distinct from patience and perseverance, is about the greatest dangers wherein one must proceed with caution; nor is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to determine what is to be done in particular. On the other hand, patience and perseverance are about minor hardships and toils, wherefore there is less danger in determining, especially in general, what is to be done in such cases.
