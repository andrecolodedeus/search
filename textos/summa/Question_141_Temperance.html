<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether temperance is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> goes against the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since "there is in us a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as stated in Ethic. ii, 1. Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> withdraws us from pleasures to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines, according to Ethic. ii, 3,8. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are connected with one another, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). But some people have <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> without having the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for we find many who are temperate, and yet covetous or timid. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> there is a corresponding <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, as appears from what we have said above (I-II, 68, 4). But seemingly no <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> corresponds to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, since all the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> have been already ascribed to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Q8,9,19,45,52, 71,139). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Music. vi, 15): "Temperance is the name of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 55, 3), it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to incline <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be in accordance with reason, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> states (Div. Nom. iv). Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is that which inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to something in accordance with reason. Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> evidently inclines <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to this, since its very name implies moderation or temperateness, which reason <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> inclines everything to whatever is becoming to it. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires pleasures that are becoming to him. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as such is a rational being, it follows that those pleasures are becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which are in accordance with reason. From such pleasures <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> does not withdraw him, but from those which are contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore it is clear that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not contrary to the inclination of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is in accord with it. It is, however, contrary to the inclination of the animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that is not subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which fulfils the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, while this is lacking to all who are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence those who lack other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, through being subject to the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, have not the <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, though they do acts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> from a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, in so far as certain imperfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as stated above (I-II, 63, 1), or acquired by habituation, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, through lack of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, are not perfected by reason, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Temperance also has a corresponding <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, namely, fear, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is withheld from the pleasures of the flesh, according to <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse120">Psalm 118:120</a>: "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear." The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear has for its principal object <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom it avoids offending, and in this respect it corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, as stated above (19, 09, ad 1). But it may have for its secondary object whatever a man shuns in order to avoid offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stands in the greatest need of the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to shun those things which are most seductive, and these are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear corresponds to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> also.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether temperance is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to preserve one's integrity and freedom from corruption for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake." But this is common to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 42) that "what we observe and seek most in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is tranquillity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." But this is common to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Offic. i, 27) that "we cannot separate the beautiful from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>," and that "whatever is just is beautiful." Now the beautiful is considered as proper to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, according to the same authority (Tully, De Offic. i, 27). Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 10) reckons it a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is customary in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech to employ a common term in a restricted sense in order to designate the principal things to which that common term is applicable: thus the word "city" is used antonomastically* to designate Rome. [Antonomasia is the figure of speech whereby we substitute the general for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> term; e.g. <em>The Philosopher</em> for <em><a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a></em>]. Accordingly the word "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>" has a twofold acceptation. First, in accordance with its common signification: and thus <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a special but a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because the word "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>" signifies a certain temperateness or moderation, which reason appoints to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> operations and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: and this is common to every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet there is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference between <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, even if we take them both as general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: since <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> withdraws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from things which <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduce</a> the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> from obeying reason, while <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> incites him to endure or withstand those things on account of which he forsakes the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason.

<p>On the other hand, if we take <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> antonomastically, as withholding the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> from those things which are most seductive to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for thus it has, like <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is corrupted chiefly by those things which <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduce</a> him into forsaking the rule of reason and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Wherefore integrity, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> ascribes to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, can, like the latter, be taken in two ways: first, in a general sense, and secondly in a sense of excellence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The things about which <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is concerned have a most disturbing effect on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the reason that they are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as we shall state further on (A4,5). Hence tranquillity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> by way of excellence, although it is a common property of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although beauty is becoming to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, by way of excellence, for two reasons. First, in respect of the generic notion of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which consists in a certain moderate and fitting proportion, and this is what we understand by beauty, as attested by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Secondly, because the things from which <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> withholds us, hold the lowest place in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and are becoming to him by reason of his animal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as we shall state further on (A4,5; 142, 4), wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that such things should defile him. On consequence beauty is a foremost attribute of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which above all hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from being defiled. On like manner honesty [Honesty must be taken here in its broad sense as synonymous with moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, from the point of view of decorum] is a special attribute of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: for <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "An honest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who has no defilement, for honesty means an honorable state." This is most applicable to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which withstands the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that bring most dishonor on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as we shall state further on (142, 4).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires and pleasures. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) that "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is reason's firm and moderate mastery of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and other wanton emotions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Now all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are called emotions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires and pleasures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Virtue is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>" [Ethic. ii, 3. Now it seems more difficult to temper fear, especially with regard to dangers of death, than to moderate desires and pleasures, which are despised on account of deadly pains and dangers, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Q83, qu. 36). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not chiefly about desires and pleasures.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Offic. i, 43) "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of moderation belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>": and Tully says (De Offic. ii, 27) that "it is the concern of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to calm all disturbances of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and to enforce moderation." Now moderation is needed, not only in desires and pleasures, but also in external acts and whatever pertains to the exterior. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires and pleasures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym.) [The words quoted do not occur in the work referred to; Cf. his De Summo Bono xxxvii, xlii, and De Different. ii, 39: that "it is <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and desire are kept under control."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (123, 12; 136, 1), it belongs to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that rebel against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is twofold, as stated above (I-II, 23, 2), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: the one, whereby the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> pursues sensible and bodily goods, the other whereby it flies from sensible and bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p>The first of these movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rebels against reason chiefly by lack of moderation. Because sensible and bodily goods, considered in their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, are not in opposition to reason, but are subject to it as instruments which reason employs in order to attain its proper end: and that they are opposed to reason is owing to the fact that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> fails to tend towards them in accord with the mode of reason. Hence it belongs properly to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to moderate those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which denote a pursuit of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in flying from sensible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is mostly in opposition to reason, not through being immoderate, but chiefly in respect of its flight: because, when a man flies from sensible and bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, which sometimes accompany the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the result is that he flies from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Hence it belongs to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> while flying from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to remain firm in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason.

<p>Accordingly, just as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> bestows firmness, is chiefly concerned with the passion, viz. fear, which regards flight from bodily <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and consequently with daring, which attacks the objects of fear in the hope of attaining some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so, too, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which denotes a kind of moderation, is chiefly concerned with those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that tend towards sensible goods, viz. desire and pleasure, and consequently with the sorrows that arise from the absence of those pleasures. For just as daring presupposes objects of fear, so too such like sorrow arises from the absence of the aforesaid pleasures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 23, 1 and 2; I-II, 25, 1), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which pertain to avoidance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, presuppose the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> pertaining to the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible presuppose the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Hence, while <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> directly moderates the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> which tend towards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as a consequence, it moderates all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, inasmuch as moderation of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that precede results in moderation of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that follow: since he that is not immoderate in desire is moderate in hope, and grieves moderately for the absence of the things he desires.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Desire denotes an impulse of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards the object of pleasure and this impulse needs control, which belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. on the other hand fear denotes a withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, against which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs firmness of mind, which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> bestows. Hence <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is properly about desires, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> about <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> External acts proceed from the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: wherefore their moderation depends on the moderation of the internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures of touch?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires and pleasures of touch. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xix) that "the function of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is to control and quell the desires which draw us to the things which withdraw us from the laws of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and from the fruit of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>"; and a little further on he adds that "it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to spurn all bodily allurements and popular praise." Now we are withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> laws not only by the desire for pleasures of touch, but also by the desire for pleasures of the other senses, for these, too, belong to the bodily allurements, and again by the desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> or for worldly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). "Desire ['Cupiditas,' which is the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> following the Greek <em>philargyria</em> renders 'desire of money'] is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires of pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "one who is worthy of small things and deems himself worthy of them is temperate, but he is not magnificent." Now honors, whether small or great, of which he is speaking there, are an object of pleasure, not of touch, but in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> apprehension. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about desires for pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that are of the same genus would seem to pertain to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> under one same aspect. Now all pleasures of sense are apparently of the same genus. Therefore they all equally belong to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are greater than the pleasures of the body, as stated above (I-II, 31, 5) in the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now sometimes men forsake <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> laws and the state of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through desire for <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, for instance, through curiosity in matters of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> promised <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis 3:5</a>): "Ye shall be as Gods, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, if pleasures of touch were the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about all pleasures of touch. But it is not about all, for instance, about those which occur in games. Therefore pleasures of touch are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is properly about desires of pleasures of touch."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about desires and pleasures in the same way as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about fear and daring with respect to the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself is dissolved; and such are dangers of death. Wherefore in like manner <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> must needs be about desires for the greatest pleasures. And since pleasure results from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operation, it is so much the greater according as it results from a more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operation. Now to animals the most <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> operations are those which preserve the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> by means of meat and drink, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> by the union of the sexes. Hence <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is properly about pleasures of meat and drink and sexual pleasures. Now these pleasures result from the sense of touch. Wherefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the passage quoted <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> apparently takes <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, not as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> having a determinate <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but as concerned with the moderation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> whatever: and this is a general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. However, we may also reply that if a man can control the greatest pleasures, much more can he control lesser ones. Wherefore it belongs chiefly and properly to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to moderate desires and pleasures of touch, and secondarily other pleasures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> takes <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> as denoting moderation in external things, when, to wit, a man tends to that which is proportionate to him, but not as denoting moderation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> emotions, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The pleasures of the other senses play a different part in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in other animals. For in other animals pleasures do not result from the other senses save in relation to sensibles of touch: thus the lion is pleased to see the stag, or to hear its voice, in relation to his food. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> derives pleasure from the other senses, not only for this reason, but also on account of the becomingness of the sensible object. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about the pleasures of the other senses, in relation to pleasures of touch, not principally but consequently: while in so far as the sensible objects of the other senses are pleasant on account of their becomingness, as when a man is pleased at a well-harmonized sound, this pleasure has nothing to do with the preservation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not of such importance that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> can be referred to them antonomastically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures are by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> greater than bodily pleasures, they are not so perceptible to the senses, and consequently they do not so strongly affect the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, against whose impulse the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason is safeguarded by moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. We may also reply that <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, strictly speaking, are in accordance with reason, wherefore they need no control, save <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as one <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasure is a hindrance to another greater and more binding.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Not all pleasures of touch regard the preservation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and consequently it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about all pleasures of touch.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether temperance is about the pleasures proper to the taste?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures proper to the taste. For pleasures of the taste result from food and drink, which are more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life than sexual pleasures, which regard the touch. But according to what has been said (4), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures in things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures proper to the taste rather than about those proper to the touch.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> rather than about things themselves. Now, according to De Anima ii, 3, "the touch is the sense of food," as regards the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the food, whereas "savor" which is the proper object of the taste, is "the pleasing <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the food." Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about the taste rather than about the touch.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to Ethic. vii, 4,7: "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance are about the same things, and so are <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence, perseverance, and effeminacy," to which delicacy pertains. Now delicacy seems to regard the delight taken in savors which are the object of the taste. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures proper to the taste.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "seemingly <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance have little if anything to do with the taste."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about the greatest pleasures, which chiefly regard the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life either in the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. On these matters certain things are to be considered as principal and others as secondary. The principal thing is the use itself of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means, of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, or of food and drink which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>: while the very use of these <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things has a certain <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> pleasure annexed thereto.

<p>In regard to either use we consider as secondary whatever makes the use more pleasurable, such as beauty and adornment in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and a pleasing savor and likewise odor in food. Hence <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is chiefly about the pleasure of touch, that results <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> from the use of these <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things, which use is in all cases attained by the touch. Secondarily, however, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance are about pleasures of the taste, smell, or sight, inasmuch as the sensible objects of these senses conduce to the pleasurable use of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things that have relation to the touch. But since the taste is more akin to the touch than the other senses are, it follows that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is more about the taste than about the other senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The use of food and the pleasure that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> results therefrom pertain to the touch. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii, 3) that "touch is the sense of food, for food is hot or cold, wet or dry." To the taste belongs the discernment of savors, which make the food pleasant to eat, in so far as they are signs of its being suitable for nourishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The pleasure resulting from savor is additional, so to speak, whereas the pleasure of touch results <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> from the use of food and drink.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Delicacy regards principally the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the food, but secondarily it regards its delicious savor and the way in which it is served.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the rule of temperance depends on the need of the present life?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> does not depend on the needs of the present life. For higher things are not regulated according to lower. Now, as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is above the needs of the body. Therefore the rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> does not depend on the needs of the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever exceeds a rule <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore if the needs of the body were the rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to indulge in any other pleasure than those required by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is content with very little. But this would seem unreasonable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in observing a rule. Therefore if the need of the body were the rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, there would be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in using any pleasure for the needs of the body, for instance, for the sake of health. But this is apparently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the need of the body is not the rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi): "In both Testaments the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> finds confirmation of the rule forbidding him to love the things of this life, or to deem any of them desirable for its own sake, and commanding him to avail himself of those things with the moderation of a user not the attachment of a lover, in so far as they are requisite for the needs of this life and of his station."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1; 109, 2; 123, 12), the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists chiefly in the order of reason: because "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be in accord with reason," as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> asserts (Div. Nom. iv). Now the principal order of reason is that by which it directs certain things towards their end, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason consists chiefly in this order; since <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the aspect of end, and the end is the rule of whatever is directed to the end. Now all the pleasurable objects that are at <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> disposal, are directed to some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of this life as to their end. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> takes the need of this life, as the rule of the pleasurable objects of which it makes use, and uses them only for as much as the need of this life requires.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, the need of this life is regarded as a rule in so far as it is an end. Now it must be observed that sometimes the end of the worker differs from the end of the work, thus it is clear that the end of building is a house, whereas sometimes the end of the builder is profit. Accordingly the end and rule of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> itself is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; while the end and rule of the thing it makes use of is the need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, to which whatever is useful for life is subordinate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life may be taken in two ways. First, it may be taken in the sense in which we apply the term "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>" to that without which a thing cannot be at all; thus food is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to an animal. Secondly, it may be taken for something without which a thing cannot be becomingly. Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> regards not only the former of these needs, but also the latter. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 11) that "the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires pleasant things for the sake of health, or for the sake of a sound <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of body." Other things that are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this purpose may be divided into two classes. For some are a hindrance to health and a sound <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of body; and these <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> makes not use of whatever, for this would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But others are not a hindrance to those things, and these <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> uses moderately, according to the demands of place and time, and in keeping with those among whom one dwells. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 11) says that the "temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also desires other pleasant things," those namely that are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for health or a sound <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of body, "so long as they are not prejudicial to these things."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated (ad 2), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> regards need according to the requirements of life, and this depends not only on the requirements of the body, but also on the requirements of external things, such as <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and station, and more still on the requirements of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conduct. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> adds (Ethic. iii, 11) that "the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes use of pleasant things provided that not only they be not prejudicial to health and a sound bodily <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, but also that they be not inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conduct, nor "beyond his <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," i.e. his means. And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi) that the "temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> considers the need" not only "of this life" but also "of his station."

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether temperance is a cardinal virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on reason. But <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about those things that are furthest removed from reason, namely about pleasures common to us and the lower animals, as stated in Ethic. iii, 10. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, seemingly, is not a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the impetus the more difficult is it to control. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is controlled by meekness, seems to be more impetuous than desire, which is controlled by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse4">Proverbs 27:4</a>): "Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth; and who can bear the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> [impetum] of one provoked?" Therefore meekness is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope as a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes precedence of desire and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as stated above (I-II, 25, 4). But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> controls the presumption of immoderate hope. Therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which controls <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> reckons <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> among the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (Moral. ii, 49).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (123, 11; 61, 3), a principal or cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is so called because it has a foremost claim to praise on account of one of those things that are requisite for the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in general. Now moderation, which is requisite in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, deserves praise principally in pleasures of touch, with which <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is concerned, both because these pleasures are most <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to us, so that it is more difficult to abstain from them, and to control the desire for them, and because their objects are more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the present life, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). For this reason <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is reckoned a principal or cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The longer the range of its operation, the greater is the agent's power [virtus] shown to be: wherefore the very fact that the reason is able to moderate desires and pleasures that are furthest removed from it, proves the greatness of reason's power. This is how <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> comes to be a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The impetuousness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, for instance, a painful hurt; wherefore it soon passes, although its impetus be great. On the other hand, the impetuousness of the desire for pleasures of touch proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, wherefore it is more lasting and more general, and consequently its control regards a more principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The object of hope is higher than the object of desire, wherefore hope is accounted the principal passion in the irascible. But the objects of desires and pleasures of touch move the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> with greater force, since they are more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which appoints the mean in such things, is a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether temperance is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 43) that "what we observe and seek most in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the safeguarding of what is honorable, and the regard for what is beautiful." Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> deserves praise for being honorable and beautiful. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more difficult the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> the greater the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now it is more difficult to control desires and pleasures of touch than to regulate external actions, the former pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and the latter to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seemingly the more general a thing is, the more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and the better it is. Now <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about dangers of death which occur less frequently than pleasures of touch, for these occur every day; so that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is in more general use than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. i, 9) that the "greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are those which are most profitable to others, for which reason we give the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the brave and the just."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 2) "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many is more of the godlike than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>," wherefore the more a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many, the better it is. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the many more than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> does, since <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> regards the relations between one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and another, while <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards dangers of battle which are endured for the common weal: whereas <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> moderates only the desires and pleasures which affect <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: while <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are more excellent still.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Honor and beauty are especially ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, not on account of the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proper to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, but on account of the disgrace of the contrary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from which it withdraws us, by moderating the pleasures common to us and the lower animals.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about the difficult and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the excellence of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is considered more under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> excels, than under the aspect of difficult, wherein <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> excels.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is general because it regards the many conduces more to the excellence of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than that which is general because it occurs frequently: <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> excels in the former way, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in the latter. Hence <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is greater simply, although in some respects <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> may be described as greater not only than <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but also than <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.
