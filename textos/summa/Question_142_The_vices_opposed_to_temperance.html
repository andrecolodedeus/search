<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether insensibility is a vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that insensibility is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For those are called insensible who are deficient with regard to pleasures of touch. Now seemingly it is praiseworthy and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> to be altogether deficient in such matters: for it is written (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse2">Daniel 10:2-3</a>): "In those days <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> mourned the days of three weeks, I ate no desirable bread, and neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth, neither was I anointed with ointment." Therefore insensibility is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is to be in accord with reason," according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv). Now abstinence from all pleasures of touch is most conducive to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> progress in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason: for it is written (<a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse17">Daniel 1:17</a>) that "to the children" who took pulse for their food (<a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse12">Daniel 1:12</a>), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and understanding in every book and wisdom." Therefore insensibility, which rejects these pleasures altogether, is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is a very effective means of avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would seem not to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now the most effective remedy in avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to shun pleasures, and this pertains to insensibility. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 9) that "if we deny ourselves pleasures we are less liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> in insensibility.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Nothing save <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now insensibility is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 11). Therefore insensibility is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whatever is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order is vicious. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has introduced pleasure into the operations that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order requires that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should make use of these pleasures, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> well-being, as regards the preservation either of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Accordingly, if anyone were to reject pleasure to the extent of omitting things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a> preservation, he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as acting counter to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of insensibility.

<p>It must, however, be observed that it is sometimes praiseworthy, and even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the sake of an end, to abstain from such pleasures as result from these operations. Thus, for the sake of the body's health, certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> refrain from pleasures of meat, drink, and sex; as also for the fulfilment of certain engagements: thus athletes and soldiers have to deny themselves many pleasures, in order to fulfil their respective duties. On like manner penitents, in order to recover health of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, have recourse to abstinence from pleasures, as a kind of diet, and those who are desirous of giving themselves up to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and Divine things need much to refrain from carnal things. Nor do any of these things pertain to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of insensibility, because they are in accord with right reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> abstained thus from pleasures, not through any horror of pleasure as though it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself, but for some praiseworthy end, in order, namely, to adapt himself to the heights of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> by abstaining from pleasures of the body. Hence the text goes on to tell of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> that he received immediately afterwards.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> without his sensitive powers. which need a bodily organ. as stated in I, 84, 7,8, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to sustain his body in order that he may use his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the body is sustained by means of operations that afford pleasure: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason cannot be in a man if he abstain from all pleasures. Yet this need for using pleasures of the body will be greater or less, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs more or less the powers of his body in accomplishing the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore it is commendable for those who undertake the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of giving themselves to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and of imparting to others a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> procreation, as it were, to abstain from many pleasures, but not for those who are in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to bodily occupations and carnal procreation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In order to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, pleasure must be shunned, not altogether, but so that it is not sought more than <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> requires.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether intemperance is a childish sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that intemperance is not a childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew 18:3</a>, "Unless you be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and become as little children," says that "a child persists not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, is unmindful of injuries, takes no pleasure in seeing a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>," all of which is contrary to intemperance. Therefore intemperance is not a childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, children have none but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires. Now "in respect of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires few <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by intemperance," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 11). Therefore intemperance is not a childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, children should be fostered and nourished: whereas <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and pleasure, about which intemperance is concerned, are always to be thwarted and uprooted, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians 3:5</a>, "Mortify . . . your members upon the earth, which are . . . <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'your members which are upon the earth, fornication . . . <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>'], etc. Therefore intemperance is not a childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 12) that "we apply the term intemperance* to childish faults." [<em>Akolasia</em> which <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> refers to <em>kolazo</em> to punish, so that its original sense would be 'impunity' or 'unrestraint.']

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be childish for two reasons. First, because it is becoming to children, and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> does not mean that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of intemperance is childish in this sense. Secondly. by way of likeness, and it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of intemperance are said to be childish. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of intemperance is one of unchecked <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is likened to a child in three ways. First, as rewards that which they both desire, for like a child <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> desires something disgraceful. This is because in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs a thing is beautiful according as it harmonizes with reason. Wherefore Tully says (De Offic. i, 27) under the heading "Comeliness is twofold," that "the beautiful is that which is in keeping with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> excellence in so far as his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> differs from other animals." Now a child does not attend to the order of reason; and in like manner "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does not listen to reason," according to Ethic. vii, 6. Secondly, they are alike as to the result. For a child, if left to his own will, becomes more self-willed: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse8">Sirach 30:8</a>): "A horse not broken becometh stubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong." So, too, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, if indulged, gathers strength: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 5): "Lust served became a custom, and custom not resisted became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>." Thirdly, as to the remedy which is applied to both. For a child is corrected by being restrained; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse13">Proverbs 23:13-14</a>): "Withhold not correction from a child . . . Thou shalt beat him with a rod, and deliver his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>." On like manner by resisting <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> we moderate it according to the demands of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> indicates this when he says (Music. vi, 11) that if the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be lifted up to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and remain fixed "thereon, the impulse of custom," i.e. carnal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, "is broken, and being suppressed is gradually weakened: for it was stronger when we followed it, and though not wholly destroyed, it is certainly less strong when we curb it." Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 12) that "as a child ought to live according to the direction of his tutor, so ought the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> to accord with reason."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes the term "childish" as denoting what is observed in children. It is not in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of intemperance is said to be childish, but by way of likeness, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A desire may be said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in two ways. First, with regard to its genus, and thus <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance are about <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires, since they are about desires of food and sex, which are directed to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly, a desire may be called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the thing that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires for its own preservation; and in this way it does not happen often that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires, for <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires only that which supplies its need, and there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in desiring this, save only where it is desired in excess as to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>. This is the only way in which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can occur with regard to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 11).

<p>There are other things in respect of which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> frequently occur, and these are certain incentives to desire devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> curiosity [Cf. 167], such as the nice [curiosa] preparation of food, or the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And though children do not affect these things much, yet intemperance is called a childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which regards <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be nourished and fostered in children, but that which pertains to the lack of reason in them should not be fostered, but corrected, as stated above.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether cowardice is a greater vice than intemperance? [Cf. 125]</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that cowardice is a greater <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> than intemperance. For a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> deserves reproach through being opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now cowardice is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, which is a more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (2; 141, 8). Therefore cowardice is a greater <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> than intemperance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the difficulty to be surmounted, the less is a man to be reproached for failure, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "it is no wonder, in fact it is pardonable, if a man is mastered by strong and overwhelming pleasures or pains." Now seemingly it is more difficult to control pleasures than other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; hence it is stated in Ethic. ii, 3, that "it is more difficult to contend against pleasure than against <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which would seem to be stronger than fear." Therefore intemperance, which is overcome by pleasure, is a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than cowardice, which is overcome by fear.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Now cowardice is more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> than intemperance, since no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires to be intemperate, whereas some desire to avoid dangers of death, which pertains to cowardice. Therefore cowardice is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than intemperance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 12) that "intemperance seems more akin to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> action than cowardice." Therefore it is more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> one may be compared with another in two ways. First, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object; secondly, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and in both ways intemperance is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than cowardice.

<p>First, as regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For cowardice shuns dangers of death, to avoid which the principal motive is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of preserving life. On the other hand, intemperance is about pleasures, the desire of which is not so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the preservation of life, because, as stated above (2, ad 2), intemperance is more about certain annexed pleasures or desires than about <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desires or pleasures. Now the more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> the motive of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the less grievous the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore intemperance is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> than cowardice, on the part of the object or motive <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>In like manner again, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and this for three reasons. First, because the more sound-minded a man is, the more grievous his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not imputed to those who are demented. Now grave fear and sorrow, especially in dangers of death, stun the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, but not so pleasure which is the motive of intemperance. Secondly, because the more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the graver it is. Now intemperance has more of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in it than cowardice has, and this for two reasons. The first is because actions done through fear have their origin in the compulsion of an external agent, so that they are not simply <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> but mixed, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1, whereas actions done for the sake of pleasure are simply <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. The second reason is because the actions of an intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> individually and less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> generically. For no one would wish to be intemperate, yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is enticed by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> pleasures which make of him an intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence the most effective remedy against intemperance is not to dwell on the consideration of singulars. It is the other way about in matters relating to cowardice: because the particular action that imposes itself on a man is less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, for instance to cast aside his shield, and the like, whereas the general purpose is more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, for instance to save himself by flight. Now that which is more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in the particular circumstances in which the act takes place, is simply more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Wherefore intemperance, being simply more <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> than cowardice, is a greater <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Thirdly, because it is easier to find a remedy for intemperance than for cowardice, since pleasures of food and sex, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of intemperance, are of everyday occurrence, and it is possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without danger by frequent practice in their regard to become temperate; whereas dangers of death are of rare occurrence, and it is more dangerous for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to encounter them frequently in order to cease being a coward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The excellence of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in comparison with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> may be considered from two standpoints. First, with regard to the end, which has the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is. And from this point of view cowardice has a certain precedence over intemperance, since by cowardice some people forsake the defense of the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Secondly, with regard to the difficulty, because it is more difficult to endure dangers of death than to refrain from any pleasures whatever: and from this point of view there is no need for cowardice to take precedence of intemperance. For just as it is a greater strength that does not succumb to a stronger force, so on the other hand to be overcome by a stronger force is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a lesser <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and to succumb to a weaker force, is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a greater <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Love of self-preservation, for the sake of which one shuns perils of death, is much more connatural than any pleasures whatever of food and sex which are directed to the preservation of life. Hence it is more difficult to overcome the fear of dangers of death, than the desire of pleasure in matters of food and sex: although the latter is more difficult to resist than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sorrow, and fear, occasioned by certain other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, in cowardice, depends rather on a general than on a particular consideration: wherefore in such cases we have the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> not simply but in a restricted sense.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether intemperance is the most disgraceful of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that intemperance is not the most disgraceful of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. As <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> so is disgrace due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more grievous than intemperance: for instance <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and the like. Therefore intemperance is not the most disgraceful of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are the more common are seemingly less disgraceful, since men are less ashamed of them. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of intemperance are most common, because they are about things connected with the common use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and in which many happen to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of intemperance do not seem to be most disgraceful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance are about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> desires and pleasures. Now certain desires and pleasures are more shameful than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> desires and pleasures; such are brutal pleasures and those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by disease as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, 5). Therefore intemperance is not the most disgraceful of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "intemperance is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> more deserving of reproach than other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Disgrace is seemingly opposed to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to excellence, as stated above (Question 103, Article 1), and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> denotes clarity (103, 1, ad 3). Accordingly intemperance is most disgraceful for two reasons. First, because it is most repugnant to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> excellence, since it is about pleasures common to us and the lower animals, as stated above (141, 2,3). Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse21">Psalm 48:21</a>): "Man, when he was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them." Secondly, because it is most repugnant to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> clarity or beauty; inasmuch as the pleasures which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of intemperance dim the light of reason from which all the clarity and beauty of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> arises: wherefore these pleasures are described as being most slavish.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says [Moral. xxxiii. 12, "the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh," which are comprised under the head of intemperance, although less culpable, are more disgraceful. The reason is that culpability is measured by inordinateness in respect of the end, while disgrace regards shamefulness, which depends chiefly on the unbecomingness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in respect of the sinner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The commonness of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminishes the shamefulness and disgrace of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but not as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> themselves.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When we say that intemperance is most disgraceful, we mean in comparison with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, those, namely, that are connected with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which to a certain extent are in conformity with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which exceed the mode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are still more disgraceful. Nevertheless such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are apparently reducible to the genus of intemperance, by way of excess: for instance, if a man delight in eating <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, or in committing the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.
