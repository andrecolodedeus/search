<h1>Question 143. The parts of temperance, in general</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3143.htm#article1">[One Article]</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the parts of temperance are rightly assigned?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) unbecomingly assigns the parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, when he asserts them to be "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, mildness, and modesty." For <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is reckoned to be distinct from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Ethic. vii, 1): whereas <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is comprised under <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, mildness seemingly softens <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not about these things, but about pleasures of touch, as stated above (Question 141, Article 4). Therefore mildness is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, modesty concerns external action, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians 4:5</a>): "Let your modesty be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Now external actions are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 58, Article 8). Therefore modesty is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Macrobius (In Somn. Scip. i, 8) reckons many more parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: for he says that "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> results in modesty, shamefacedness, abstinence, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, honesty, moderation, lowliness, sobriety, purity." Andronicus also says [De Affectibus] that "the companions of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> are gravity, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, simplicity, refinement, method, contentment." ['Per-se-sufficientiam' which could be rendered 'self-sufficiency,' but for the fact that this is taken in a bad sense. See 169, 1.] Therefore it seems that Tully insufficiently reckoned the parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Q48,128), a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may have three kinds of parts, namely integral, subjective, and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>. The integral parts of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> the concurrence of which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and in this respect there are two integral parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, "shamefacedness," whereby one recoils from the disgrace that is contrary to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and "honesty," whereby one loves the beauty of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For, as stated above (141, 2, ad 3), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> more than any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lays claim to a certain comeliness, and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of intemperance excel others in disgrace.

<p>The subjective parts of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> have to be differentiated according to the difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object. Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is about pleasures of touch, which are of two kinds. For some are directed to nourishment: and in these as regards meat, there is "abstinence," and as regards drink properly there is "sobriety." Other pleasures are directed to the power of procreation, and in these as regards the principal pleasure of the act itself of procreation, there is "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>," and as to the pleasures incidental to the act, resulting, for instance, from <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a>, touching, or fondling, we have "purity."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> parts of a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are called secondary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for while the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> observes the mode in some principal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, these observe the mode in some other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein moderation is not so difficult. Now it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to moderate pleasures of touch, which are most difficult to moderate. Wherefore any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is effective of moderation in some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or other, and restrains the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in its impulse towards something, may be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed thereto.

<p>This happens in three ways: first, in the inward movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; secondly, in the outward movements and actions of the body; thirdly, in outward things. Now besides the movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> moderates and restrains, we find in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> three movements towards a particular object. On the first place there is the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> when stirred by the impulse of passion: and this movement is restrained by "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>," the effect of which is that, although a man suffer immoderate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, his will does not succumb to them. Another inward movement towards something is the movement of hope, and of the resultant daring, and this is moderated or restrained by "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." The third movement is that of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which tends towards revenge, and this is restrained by "meekness" or "mildness."

<p>With regard to bodily movements and actions, moderation and restraint is the effect of "modesty," which, according to Andronicus, has three parts. The first of these enables one to discern what to do and what not to do, and to observe the right order, and to persevere in what we do: this he assigns to "method." The second is that a man observe decorum in what he does, and this he ascribes to "refinement." The third has to do with the conversation or any other intercourse between a man and his friends, and this is called "gravity."

<p>With regard to external things, a twofold moderation has to be observed. First, we must not desire too many, and to this Macrobius assigns "lowliness," and Andronicus "contentment"; secondly, we must not be too nice in our requirements, and to this Macrobius ascribes "moderation," Andronicus "simplicity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, just as imperfect differs from perfect, as we shall state further on (165, 1); and in this sense it is condivided with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet it has something in common with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> both as to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since it is about pleasures of touch, and as to mode, since it is a kind of restraint. Hence it is suitably assigned as a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mildness or meekness is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> not because of a likeness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but because they agree as to the mode of restraint and moderation as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of external action <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> considers what is due to another. Modesty does not consider this, but only a certain moderation. Hence it is reckoned a part not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Under modesty Tully includes whatever pertains to the moderation of bodily movements and external things, as well as the moderation of hope which we reckoned as pertaining to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.
