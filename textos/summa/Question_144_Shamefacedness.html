<h1>Question 144. Shamefacedness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3144.htm#article1"> Is shamefacedness a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3144.htm#article2"> What is its object?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3144.htm#article3"> Who are the cause of a man being ashamed?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3144.htm#article4"> What kind of people are ashamed?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether shamefacedness is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is proper to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "to observe the mean as fixed by reason": this is clear from the definition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> given in Ethic. ii, 6. Now shamefacedness observes the mean in this way, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. ii, 7). Therefore shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is praiseworthy is either a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or something connected with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now shamefacedness is praiseworthy. But it is not part of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For it is not a part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, since it is not in the reason but in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; nor is it a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. since shamefacedness implies a certain passion, whereas <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is not about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; nor again is it a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, because it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to be persistent and aggressive, while it belongs to shamefacedness to recoil from something; nor lastly is it a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, since the latter is about desires, whereas shamefacedness is a kind of fear according as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iv, 9) and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 15). Hence it follows that shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the honest and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are convertible according to Tully (De Offic. i, 27). Now shamefacedness is a part of honesty: for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 43) that "shamefacedness is the companion and familiar of the restful mind, averse to wantonness, a stranger to any kind of excess, the friend of sobriety and the support of what is honest, a seeker after the beautiful." Therefore shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are opposed to shamefacedness, namely shamelessness and inordinate prudery. Therefore shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, "like acts beget like <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>," according to Ethic. ii, 1. Now shamefacedness implies a praiseworthy act; wherefore from many such acts a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> results. But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 12). Therefore shamefacedness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 9) that shamefacedness is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtue is taken in two ways, in a strict sense and in a broad sense. Taken strictly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a perfection, as stated in Phys. vii, 17,18. Wherefore anything that is inconsistent with perfection, though it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, falls short of the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now shamefacedness is inconsistent with perfection, because it is the fear of something base, namely of that which is disgraceful. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) that "shamefacedness is fear of a base action." Now just as hope is about a possible and difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so is fear about a possible and arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (I-II, 40, 1; I-II, 41, 2; I-II, 42, 3), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But one who is perfect as to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, does not apprehend that which would be disgraceful and base to do, as being possible and arduous, that is to say difficult for him to avoid; nor does he actually do anything base, so as to be in fear of disgrace. Therefore shamefacedness, properly speaking, is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it falls short of the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Taken, however, in a broad sense <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> denotes whatever is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and praiseworthy in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; and in this way shamefacedness is sometimes called a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it is a praiseworthy passion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Observing the mean is not sufficient for the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although it is one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> included in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> definition: but it is requisite, in addition to this, that it be "an elective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," that is to say, operating from choice. Now shamefacedness denotes, not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> but a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, nor does its movement result from choice, but from an impulse of passion. Hence it falls short of the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, shamefacedness is fear of baseness and disgrace. Now it has been stated (142, 4) that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of intemperance is most base and disgraceful. Wherefore shamefacedness pertains more to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> than to any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by reason of its motive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which is a base action though not according to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the passion, namely fear. Nevertheless in so far as the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are base and disgraceful, shamefacedness may also pertain to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Shamefacedness fosters honesty, by removing that which is contrary thereto, but not so as to attain to the perfection of honesty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Every defect <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but not every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is sufficient for the notion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Consequently it does not follow that whatever is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as regards its origin. Hence shamelessness, in so far as it results from excessive love of disgraceful things, is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Being frequently ashamed <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of an acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby one avoids disgraceful things which are the object of shamefacedness, without continuing to be ashamed in their regard: although as a consequence of this acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, a man would be more ashamed, if confronted with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of shamefacedness.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether shamefacedness is about a disgraceful action?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that shamefacedness is not about a disgraceful action. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 9) that "shamefacedness is fear of disgrace." Now sometimes those who do nothing wrong suffer ignominy, according to <a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse8">Psalm 67:8</a>, "For thy sake I have borne reproach, shame hath covered my face." Therefore shamefacedness is not properly about a disgraceful action.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing apparently is disgraceful but what is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ashamed of things that are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for instance when he performs a menial occupation. Therefore it seems that shamefacedness is not properly about a disgraceful action.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are not disgraceful but most beautiful according to Ethic. i, 8. Yet sometimes people are ashamed to do <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse26">Luke 9:26</a>, "He that shall be ashamed of Me and My words, of him the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be ashamed," etc. Therefore shamefacedness is not about a disgraceful action.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if shamefacedness were properly about a disgraceful action, it would follow that the more disgraceful the action the more ashamed would one be. Yet sometimes a man is more ashamed of lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while he glories in those which are most grievous, according to <a href="../bible/psa051.htm#verse3">Psalm 51:3</a>, "Why dost thou <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>?" Therefore shamefacedness is not properly about a disgraceful action.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, (De Nat. Hom. xx)] say that "shamefacedness is fear of doing a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> or of a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> done."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 41, 2; I-II, 42, 3), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, fear is properly about an arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, one, namely, that is difficult to avoid. Now disgrace is twofold. There is the disgrace inherent to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, which consists in the deformity of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act: and this, properly speaking, has not the character of an arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For that which depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone does not appear to be arduous and above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ability: wherefore it is not apprehended as fearful, and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are not a matter of fear.

<p>The other kind of disgrace is penal so to speak, and it consists in the reproach that attaches to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, just as the clarity of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> consists in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. And since this reproach has the character of an arduous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> has the character of an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, shamefacedness, which is fear of disgrace, regards first and foremost reproach or ignominy. And since reproach is properly due to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it follows that shamefacedness regards also the disgrace inherent to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "a man is less ashamed of those defects which are not the result of any fault of his own."

<p>Now shamefacedness regards fault in two ways. On one way a man refrains from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> acts through fear of reproach: in another way a man while doing a disgraceful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> avoids the public eye through fear of reproach. In the former case, according to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xx), we speak of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> "blushing," in the latter we say that he is "ashamed." Hence he says that "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is ashamed acts in secret, but he who blushes <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> to be disgraced."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Shamefacedness properly regards disgrace as due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> defect. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "a man is more ashamed of those things of which he is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises the disgrace to which he is subject on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because he does not deserve it; as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says of the magnanimous (Ethic. iv, 3). Thus we find it said of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts 5:41</a>) that "they (the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>) went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>." It is owing to imperfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that a man is sometimes ashamed of the reproaches which he suffers on account of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since the more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> a man is, the more he despises external things, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse7">Isaiah 51:7</a>): "Fear ye not the reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 63, Article 3), though <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is not really due save to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> alone, yet it regards a certain excellence: and the same applies to reproach, for though it is properly due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone, yet, at least in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> opinion, it regards any kind of defect. Hence a man is ashamed of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, disrepute, servitude, and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Shamefacedness does not regard <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as such. Yet it happens <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> that a man is ashamed of them either because he looks upon them as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion, or because he is afraid of being marked as presumptuous or hypocritical for doing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sometimes more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are less shameful, either because they are less disgraceful, as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in comparison with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, or because they connote a certain abundance of some temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; thus a man is more ashamed of cowardice than of daring, of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> than of robbery, on account of a semblance of power. The same applies to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether man is more shamefaced of those who are more closely connected with him?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not more shamefaced of those who are more closely connected with him. For it is stated in Rhet. ii, 6 that "men are more shamefaced of those from whom they desire approbation." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire this especially from people of the better sort who are sometimes not connected with them. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not more shamefaced of those who are more closely connected with him.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly those are more closely connected who perform like <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not made ashamed of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by those whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be guilty of the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because according to Rhet. ii, 6, "a man does not forbid his neighbor what he does himself." Therefore he is not more shamefaced of those who are most closely connected with him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men take more shame from those who retail their information to many, such as jokers and fable-tellers." But those who are more closely connected with a man do not retail his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore one should not take shame chiefly from them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men are most liable to be made ashamed by those among whom they have done nothing amiss; by those of whom they ask something for the first time; by those whose friends they wish to become." Now these are less closely connected with us. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not made most ashamed by those who are more closely united to him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is stated in Rhet. ii, 6 that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made most ashamed by those who are to be continually with him."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since reproach is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> denotes attestation to someone's excellence, especially the excellence which is according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so too reproach, the fear of which is shamefacedness, denotes attestation to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> defect, especially that which results from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence the more weighty a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> attestation is considered to be, the more does he make another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> ashamed. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> attestation may be considered as being more weighty, either because he is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or because of its effect. Certitude of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> attaches to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> attestations for two reasons. First on account of the rectitude of his judgment, as in the case of wise and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men, by whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more desirous of being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and by whom he is brought to a greater sense of shame. Hence children and the lower animals inspire no one with shame, by reason of their lack of judgment. Secondly, on account of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> attested, because "everyone judges well of what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him" [Ethic. i, 3. On this way we are more liable to be made ashamed by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> connected with us, since they are better acquainted with our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: whereas strangers and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> entirely unknown to us, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what we do, inspire us with no shame at all.

<p>An attestation receives weight from its effect by reason of some advantage or harm resulting therefrom; wherefore men are more desirous of being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by those who can be of use to them, and are more liable to be made ashamed by those who are able to do them some harm. And for this reason again, in a certain respect, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> connected with us make us more ashamed, since we are to be continually in their society, as though this entailed a continual harm to us: whereas the harm that comes from strangers and passersby ceases almost at once.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> People of the better sort make us ashamed for the same reason as those who are more closely connected with us; because just as the attestation of the better men carries more weight since they have a more universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, and in their judgments hold fast to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: so, too, the attestation of those among whom we live is more cogent since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more about our concerns in detail.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We fear not the attestation of those who are connected with us in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because we do not think that they look upon our defect as disgraceful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Tale-bearers make us ashamed on account of the harm they do by making many think ill of us.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even those among whom we have done no wrong, make us more ashamed, on account of the harm that would follow, because, to wit, we should forfeit the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> opinion they had of us: and again because when contraries are put in juxtaposition their opposition seems greater, so that when a man notices something disgraceful in one whom he esteemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he apprehends it as being the more disgraceful. The reason why we are made more ashamed by those of whom we ask something for the first time, or whose friends we wish to be, is that we fear to suffer some injury, by being disappointed in our request, or by failing to become their friends.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether even virtuous men can be ashamed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that even <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men can be ashamed. For contraries have contrary effects. Now those who excel in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are not ashamed, according to <a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 3:3</a>, "Thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not blush." Therefore those who are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are more inclined to be ashamed.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men are ashamed not only of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but also of the signs of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>": and this happens also in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men can be ashamed.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, shamefacedness is "fear of disgrace" [Ethic. iv, 9. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> people may happen to be ignominious, for instance if they are slandered, or if they suffer reproach undeservedly. Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be ashamed.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, shamefacedness is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (143). Now a part is not separated from its whole. Since then <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it means that shamefacedness is also.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 9) that a "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not shamefaced."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2) shamefacedness is fear of some disgrace. Now it may happen in two ways that an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not feared: first, because it is not reckoned an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; secondly because one reckons it impossible with regard to oneself, or as not difficult to avoid.

<p>Accordingly shame may be lacking in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways. First, because the things that should make him ashamed are not deemed by him to be disgraceful; and in this way those who are steeped in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are without shame, for instead of disapproving of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they boast of them. Secondly, because they apprehend disgrace as impossible to themselves, or as easy to avoid. On this way the old and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are not shamefaced. Yet they are so disposed, that if there were anything disgraceful in them they would be ashamed of it. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 9) that "shame is in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> hypothetically."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lack of shame occurs in the best and in the worst men through different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated in the Article. On the average men it is found, in so far as they have a certain love of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and yet are not altogether free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to avoid not only <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but also whatever has the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse22">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>, "From all appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> refrain yourselves." The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, too, says (Ethic. iv, 9) that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should avoid "not only what is really <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also those things that are regarded as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (1, ad 1) the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> despises ignominy and reproach, as being things he does not deserve, wherefore he is not much ashamed of them. Nevertheless, to a certain extent, shame, like the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, may forestall reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Shamefacedness is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, not as though it entered into its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but as a disposition to it: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 43) that "shamefacedness lays the first foundation of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>," by inspiring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with the horror of whatever is disgraceful.
