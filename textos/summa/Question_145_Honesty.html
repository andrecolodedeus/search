<h1>Question 145. Honesty</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3145.htm#article1"> The relation between the honest and the virtuous</a> <li><a href="../summa/3145.htm#article2"> Its relation with the beautiful</a> <li><a href="../summa/3145.htm#article3"> Its relation with the useful and the pleasant</a> <li><a href="../summa/3145.htm#article4"> Is honesty a part of temperance?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether honesty is the same as virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that honesty is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53) that "the honest is what is desired for its own sake." Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is desired, not for its own sake, but for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 9) that "<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the reward and the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." Therefore honesty is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (Etym. x) "honesty means an honorable state." Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to many things besides <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since "it is praise that is the proper due of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>" (Ethic. i, 12). Therefore honesty is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the "principal part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the interior choice," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. viii, 13). But honesty seems to pertain rather to exterior conduct, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse40">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>, "Let all things be done decently [honeste] and according to order" among you. Therefore honesty is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, honesty apparently consists in external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. According to <a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse14">Sirach 11:14</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, life and death [<a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>] are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [The words in brackets are omitted in the Leonine edition. For <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> has 'honestas']. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not consist in external <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Therefore honesty is not the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Offic. i, 5; Rhet. ii, 53) divides honesty into the four principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, into which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is also divided. Therefore honesty is the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) "honesty means an honorable state," wherefore a thing may be said to be honest through being worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as stated above (144, 2, ad 2), is due to excellence: and the excellence of a man is gauged chiefly according to his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated in Phys. vii, 17. Therefore, properly speaking, honesty refers to the same thing as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 7), of those things that are desired for their own sake, some are desired for their own sake alone, and never for the sake of something else, such as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which is the last end; while some are desired, not only for their own sake, inasmuch as they have an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in themselves, even if no further <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> accrued to us through them, but also for the sake of something else, inasmuch as they are conducive to some more perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are desirable for their own sake: wherefore Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 52) that "some things allure us by their own force, and attract us by their own worth, such as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." And this suffices to give a thing the character of honest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some of the things which are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> besides <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are more excellent than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and such like things are not so well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by experience as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which we practice day by day. Hence <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has a greater claim to the name of honesty. Other things which are beneath <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, in so far as they are a help to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, such as rank, power, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> [Ethic. i, 8. For as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that these things "are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by some people, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>." Now a man is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore praise is due to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as the latter is desirable for the sake of something else, while <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for its own sake: and it is thus that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has the character of honesty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As we have stated honest denotes that to which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due. Now <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is an attestation to someone's excellence, as stated above (103, 1 and 2). But one attests only to what one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; and the internal choice is not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> save by external actions. Wherefore external conduct has the character of honesty, in so far as it reflects internal rectitude. For this reason honesty consists radically in the internal choice, but its expression lies in the external conduct.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is because the excellence of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is commonly regarded as making a man deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, that sometimes the name of honesty is given to external prosperity.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the honest is the same as the beautiful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the honest is not the same as the beautiful. For the aspect of honest is derived from the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, since the honest is "what is desirable for its own sake" [Cicero, De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53. But the beautiful regards rather the faculty of vision to which it is pleasing. Therefore the beautiful is not the same as the honest.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, beauty requires a certain clarity, which is characteristic of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: whereas the honest regards <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> differ, as stated above (103, 1, ad 3), it seems also that the honest and the beautiful differ.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, honesty is the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But a certain beauty is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse15">Ezekiel 16:15</a>): "Trusting in thy beauty thou playest the harlot because of thy renown." Therefore the honest is not the same as the beautiful.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 12:23-24</a>): "Those that are our uncomely [inhonesta] parts, have more abundant comeliness [honestatem], but our comely [honesta] parts have no need." Now by uncomely parts he means the baser members, and by comely parts the beautiful members. Therefore the honest and the beautiful are apparently the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As may be gathered from the words of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), beauty or comeliness results from the concurrence of clarity and due proportion. For he states that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be beautiful, as being "the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the harmony and clarity of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>." Hence the beauty of the body consists in a man having his bodily limbs well proportioned, together with a certain clarity of color. On like manner <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty consists in a man's conduct or actions being well proportioned in respect of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> clarity of reason. Now this is what is meant by honesty, which we have stated (1) to be the same as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that moderates according to reason all that is connected with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore "honesty is the same as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Q83, qu. 30): "By honesty I mean intelligible beauty, which we properly designate as <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>," and further on he adds that "many things are beautiful to the eye, which it would be hardly proper to call honest."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The object that moves the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is an apprehended <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now if a thing is perceived to be beautiful as soon as it is apprehended, it is taken to be something becoming and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the beautiful and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are beloved by all." Wherefore the honest, inasmuch as it implies <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty, is an object of desire, and for this reason Tully says (De Offic. i, 5): "Thou perceivest the form and the features, so to speak, of honesty; and were it to be seen with the eye, would, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> declares, arouse a wondrous love of wisdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (103, 1, ad 3), <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the effect of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: because through being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> or praised, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> acquires clarity in the eyes of others. Wherefore, just as the same thing makes a man honorable and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, so is the same thing honest and beautiful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument applies to the beauty of the body: although it might be replied that to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of one's honesty is to play the harlot because of one's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty, according to <a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse17">Ezekiel 28:17</a>, "Thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty, thou hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the honest differs from the useful and the pleasant?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the honest does not differ from the useful and the pleasant. For the honest is "what is desirable for its own sake" [Cicero, De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53. Now pleasure is desired for its own sake, for "it seems ridiculous to ask a man why he wishes to be pleased," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. x, 2). Therefore the honest does not differ from the pleasant.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are comprised under the head of useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 52): "There is a thing that attracts the desire not by any force of its own, nor by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but on account of its fruitfulness and utility": and "that is money." Now <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> come under the head of honesty, for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse14">Sirach 11:14</a>): "Poverty and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> [honestas] are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and (<a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse2">Sirach 13:2</a>): "He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honorable," i.e. richer, "than himself." Therefore the honest differs not from the useful.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully proves (De Offic. ii, 3) that nothing can be useful unless it be honest: and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> makes the same statement (De Offic. ii, 6). Therefore the useful differs not from the honest.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (83, qu. 30): "The honest is that which is desirable for its own sake: the useful implies reference to something else."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The honest concurs in the same subject with the useful and the pleasant, but it differs from them in aspect. For, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), a thing is said to be honest, in so far as it has a certain beauty through being regulated by reason. Now whatever is regulated in accordance with reason is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Again, it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a thing to take pleasure in that which is becoming to it. Wherefore an honest thing is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> pleasing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves this with regard to acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (Ethic. i, 8). Yet not all that is pleasing is honest, since a thing may be becoming according to the senses, but not according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. A pleasing thing of this kind is beside <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason which perfects his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> honest, is referred to something else as its end namely <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Accordingly the honest the useful, and the pleasant concur in the one subject.

<p>Nevertheless they differ in aspect. For a thing is said to be honest as having a certain excellence deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> on account of its <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty: while it is said to be pleasing, as bringing rest to desire, and useful, as referred to something else. The pleasant, however, extends to more things than the useful and the honest: since whatever is useful and honest is pleasing in some respect, whereas the converse does not hold (Ethic. ii, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing is said to be honest, if it is desired for its own sake by the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which tends to that which is in accordance with reason: while a thing is said to be pleasant if it is desired for its own sake by the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Riches are denominated honesty according of the opinion of the many who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>: or because they are intended to be the instruments of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Tully and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> mean to say that nothing incompatible with honesty can be simply and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> useful, since it follows that it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> last end, which is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in accordance with reason; although it may perhaps be useful in some respect, with regard to a particular end. But they do not mean to say that every useful thing as such may be classed among those that are honest.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether honesty should be reckoned a part of temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that honesty should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For it is not possible for a thing to be part and whole in respect of one same thing. Now "<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is a part of honesty," according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53). Therefore honesty is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated (3 Esdra 3:21) that "wine . . . makes all thoughts honest." But the use of wine, especially in excess, in which sense the passage quoted should seemingly be taken, pertains to intemperance rather than to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore honesty is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the honest is that which is deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Now "it is the just and the brave who receive most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Rhet. i, 9). Therefore honesty pertains, not to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, but rather to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>: wherefore Eleazar said as related in <a href="../bible/2ma006.htm#verse28">2 Maccabees 6:28</a>: "I suffer an honorable [honesta] death, for the most venerable and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> laws."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i] reckons honesty a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (De Offic. i, 43) ascribes honesty as pertaining especially to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), honesty is a kind of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty. Now the disgraceful is opposed to the beautiful: and opposites are most manifest of one another. Wherefore seemingly honesty belongs especially to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, since the latter repels that which is most disgraceful and unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely animal lusts. Hence by its very name <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is most significative of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason to which it belongs to moderate and temper <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. Accordingly honesty, as being ascribed for a special reason to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, is reckoned as a part thereof, not as a subjective part, nor as an annexed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but as an integral part or <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching thereto.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Temperance is accounted a subjective part of honesty taken in a wide sense: it is not thus that the latter is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man is intoxicated, "the wine makes his thoughts honest" according to his own reckoning because he deems himself great and deserving of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> [Cf. 148, 6.]

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> than to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, because they excel in the point of a greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: yet greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which it holds in check are the most deserving of reproach, as stated above. Thus honesty is more to be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> according to the rule given by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 12:23</a>) when he says that "our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness," which, namely, destroys whatever is uncomely.
