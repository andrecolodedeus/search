<h1>Question 146. Abstinence</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3146.htm#article1"> Is abstinence a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3146.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether abstinence is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that abstinence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not in speech but in power [virtute]." Now the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> does not consist in abstinence, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse17">Romans 14:17</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 11 observes that "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists neither in abstaining nor in eating." Therefore abstinence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 11) addressing himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "This hast Thou taught me, that I should set myself to take food as physic." Now it belongs not to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but to the medical art to regulate medicine. Therefore, in like manner, to regulate one's food, which belongs to abstinence, is an act not of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but of art.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> "observes the mean," as stated in Ethic. ii, 6,7. But abstinence seemingly inclines not to the mean but to deficiency, since it denotes retrenchment. Therefore abstinence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> excludes another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But abstinence excludes patience: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "impatience not unfrequently dislodges the abstainer's mind from its peaceful seclusion." Likewise he says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> pierces the thoughts of the abstainer," so that abstinence excludes <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Therefore abstinence is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse5">2 Peter 1:5-6</a>): "Join with your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> abstinence"; where abstinence is numbered among other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore abstinence is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Abstinence by its very name denotes retrenchment of food. Hence the term abstinence may be taken in two ways. First, as denoting retrenchment of food absolutely, and in this way it signifies neither a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act, but something indifferent. Secondly, it may be taken as regulated by reason, and then it signifies either a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. This is the meaning of Peter's words quoted above, where he says that we ought "to join abstinence with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," namely that in abstaining from food a man should act with due regard for those among whom he lives, for his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and for the requirements of health.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The use of and abstinence from food, considered in themselves, do not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>): "Meat doth not commend us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For neither, if we eat not [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Neither if we eat . . . nor if we eat not'], shall we have the less, nor if we eat, shall we have the more," i.e. spiritually. Nevertheless they both belong to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, in so far as they are done reasonably through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The regulation of food, in the point of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, belongs to the art of medicine as regards the health of the body: but in the point of internal affections with regard to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it belongs to abstinence. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 11): "It makes no difference whatever to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> what or how much food a man takes, so long as he does it with due regard for the people among whom he lives, for his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and for the requirements of his health: but it matters how readily and uncomplainingly he does without food when bound by <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> to abstain."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to bridle the pleasures which are too alluring to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, just as it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> that deter it from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason. Wherefore, just as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is commended on account of a certain excess, from which all the parts of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> take their name, so <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is commended for a kind of deficiency, from which all its parts are denominated. Hence abstinence, since it is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, is named from deficiency, and yet it observes the mean, in so far as it is in accord with right reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> result from abstinence in so far as it is not in accord with right reason. For right reason makes one abstain as one ought, i.e. with gladness of heart, and for the due end, i.e. for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and not one's own.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether abstinence is a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that abstinence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is praiseworthy by itself. But abstinence is not praiseworthy by itself; for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence is praised only on account of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore abstinence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Pet. xlii) that "the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> abstain from meat and drink, not that any creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but merely in order to chastise the body." Now this belongs to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as its very name denotes. Therefore abstinence is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be content with moderate meat, so should he be satisfied with moderate clothes, according to <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8</a>, "Having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we should be [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'are'] content." Now there is no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in being content with moderate clothes. Neither, therefore, is there in abstinence which moderates food.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i, 8 reckons abstinence as a special part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (136, 1; 141, 3) moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> maintains the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against the onslaught of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: hence whenever we find a special motive why a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> departs from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, there is need of a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now pleasures of the table are of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, both because they are so great, and because food is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who needs it for the maintenance of life, which he desires above all other things. Therefore abstinence is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virtues are of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> connected together, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). Wherefore one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> receives help and commendation from another, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Accordingly in this way the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence receives commendation on account of the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The body is chastised by means of abstinence, not only against the allurements of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but also against those of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>: since by abstaining a man gains strength for overcoming the onslaughts of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, which increase in force the more he yields to them. Yet abstinence is not prevented from being a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through being a help to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, since one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> helps another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The use of clothing was devised by art, whereas the use of food is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it is more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for the moderation of food than for the moderation of clothing.
