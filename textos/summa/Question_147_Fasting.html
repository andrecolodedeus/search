<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether fasting is an act of virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For every act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not always acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse3">Isaiah 58:3</a>, "Why have we fasted and Thou hast not regarded?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> forsakes the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> forsakes the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence takes account of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of supplying the needs of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> something is retrenched therefrom: else those who do not fast would not have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which is competent to all, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now such is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, since every one is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> before eating. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned together with other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 6:5-6</a>) where the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "In <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, etc. [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>']."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An act is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> through being directed by reason to some <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> [honestum] [Cf. 145, 1] <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now this is consistent with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is practiced for a threefold purpose. First, in order to bridle the lusts of the flesh, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 6:5-6</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>," since <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is the guardian of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Contra Jov. ii.] "Venus is cold when Ceres and Bacchus are not there," that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is cooled by abstinence in meat and drink. Secondly, we have recourse to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> may arise more freely to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heavenly things: hence it is related (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm">Daniel 10</a>) of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> that he received a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for three weeks. Thirdly, in order to satisfy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse12">Joel 2:12</a>): "Be converted to Me with all your heart, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and in weeping and in mourning." The same is declared by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in a sermon (De orat. et Jejun. [Serm. lxxii (ccxxx, de Tempore)]): "Fasting cleanses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, raises the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, subjects one's flesh to the spirit, renders the heart <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, scatters the clouds of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, quenches the fire of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, kindles the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> An act that is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> generically may be rendered <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> by its connection with certain circumstances. Hence the text goes on to say: "Behold in the day of your fast your own <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is founded," and a little further on (<a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse4">Isaiah 58:4</a>): "You fast for debates and strife and strike with the fist wickedly." These words are expounded by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Pastor. iii, 19) as follows: "The will indicates <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the fist <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. On vain then is the flesh restrained if the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> allowed to drift to inordinate movements be wrecked by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (in the same sermon) that "<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> loves not many words, deems <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> superfluous, scorns <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, commends <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, helps <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to perceive what is frail and paltry."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is measured not according to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> but according to right reason, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. Now reason judges it expedient, on account of some special motive, for a man to take less food than would be becoming to him under ordinary circumstances, for instance in order to avoid sickness, or in order to perform certain bodily works with greater ease: and much more does reason direct this to the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods. Yet reason does not retrench so much from one's food as to refuse <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> support: thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says:* "It matters not whether thou art a long or a short time in destroying thyself, since to afflict the body immoderately, whether by excessive lack of nourishment, or by eating or sleeping too little, is to offer a sacrifice of stolen goods." [The quotation is from the Corpus of Canon Law (Cap. Non mediocriter, De Consecrationibus, dist. 5). Gratian there ascribes the quotation to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, but it is not to be found in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> works.] In like manner right reason does not retrench so much from a man's food as to render him incapable of fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (in the same reference) "Rational <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> forfeits his dignity, if he sets <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> before <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, or night-watchings before the well-being of his senses."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in respect of which a man is said to be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> until he partakes of food, consists in a pure negation, wherefore it cannot be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act. Such is only the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of one who abstains in some measure from food for a reasonable purpose. Hence the former is called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> [jejunium jejunii] [Literally the 'fast of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>']: while the latter is called the faster's fast, because he fasts for a purpose.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether fasting is an act of abstinence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of abstinence. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [The quotation is from the Ordinary Gloss, where the reference is lacking] <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse20">Matthew 17:20</a>, "This kind of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>" says: "To fast is to abstain not only from food but also from all manner of lusts." Now this belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not exclusively an act of abstinence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a Lenten Homily (xvi in Evang.) that "the Lenten fast is a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the whole year." Now paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> is an act of religion, as stated above (Question 87, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is an act of religion and not of abstinence.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, abstinence is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (Q143,146, 1, ad 3). Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to which it belongs to endure hardships, and this seems very applicable to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not an act of abstinence.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. vi, 19) that "<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is frugality of fare and abstinence from food."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Habit and act have the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Wherefore every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> act about some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that appoints the mean in that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is concerned with food, wherein the mean is appointed by abstinence. Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is an act of abstinence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Properly speaking <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> consists in abstaining from food, but speaking metaphorically it denotes abstinence from anything harmful, and such especially is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>We may also reply that even properly speaking <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is abstinence from all manner of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, since, as stated above (1, ad 1), an act ceases to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> by the conjunction of any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Nothing prevents the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> belonging to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it is directed to the end of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as explained above (32, 1, ad 2; 85, 3). Accordingly there is no reason why <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> should not be an act of religion, or of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, or of any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to endure, not any kind of hardship, but only those connected with the danger of death. To endure hardships resulting from privation of pleasure of touch, belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and its parts: and such are the hardships of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fasting is a matter of precept?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not a matter of precept. For precepts are not given about works of supererogation which are a matter of counsel. Now <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is a work of supererogation: else it would have to be equally observed at all places and times. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not a matter of precept.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever infringes a precept commits a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> were a matter of precept, all who do not fast would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally, and a widespreading snare would be laid for men.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 17) that "the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> having taken <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and called us to a state of freedom, instituted a few most salutary <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whereby the community of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, that is, of the free multitude, should be bound together in subjection to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people seems to be hindered by a great number of observances no less than by a great number of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ad inquis. Januar., Ep. lv) that "whereas <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mercy wished our religion to be distinguished by its freedom and the evidence and small number of its <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, some people render it oppressive with slavish burdens." Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not have made <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> a matter of precept.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Ad Lucin., Ep. lxxi) speaking of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> says: "Let each province keep to its own practice, and look upon the commands of the elders as though they were laws of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is a matter of precept.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as it belongs to the secular authority to make legal precepts which apply the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> to matters of common weal in temporal affairs, so it belongs to ecclesiastical superiors to prescribe by statute those things that concern the common weal of the faithful in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods.

<p>Now it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is useful as atoning for and preventing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and as raising the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things. And everyone is bound by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> dictate of reason to practice <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> as far as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for these purposes. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in general is a matter of precept of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, while the fixing of the time and manner of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> as becoming and profitable to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, is a matter of precept of positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> established by ecclesiastical authority: the latter is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> fast, the former is the fast prescribed by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fasting considered in itself denotes something not eligible but penal: yet it becomes eligible in so far as it is useful to some end. Wherefore considered absolutely it is not binding under precept, but it is binding under precept to each one that stands in need of such a remedy. And since men, for the most part, need this remedy, both because "in many things we all offend" (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James 3:2</a>), and because "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>), it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should appoint certain fasts to be kept by all in common. On doing this the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not make a precept of a matter of supererogation, but particularizes in detail that which is of general <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those commandments which are given under the form of a general precept, do not bind all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the same way, but subject to the requirements of the end intended by the lawgiver. It will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to disobey a commandment through contempt of the lawgiver's authority, or to disobey it in such a way as to frustrate the end intended by him: but it is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if one fails to keep a commandment, when there is a reasonable motive, and especially if the lawgiver would not insist on its observance if he were present. Hence it is that not all, who do not keep the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking there of those things "that are neither contained in the authorities of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, nor found among the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in council, nor sanctioned by the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." On the other hand, the fasts that are of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> are appointed by the councils of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and are sanctioned by the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor are they opposed to the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, rather are they of use in hindering the slavery of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> freedom, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse13">Galatians 5:13</a>): "You, brethren, have been called unto liberty; only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether all are bound to keep the fasts of the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all are bound to keep the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are binding even as the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke 10:16</a>, "He that heareth you heareth Me." Now all are bound to keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore in like manner all are bound to keep the fasts appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, children especially are seemingly not exempt from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, on account of their age: for it is written (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse15">Joel 2:15</a>): "Sanctify a fast," and further on (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse16">Joel 2:16</a>): "Gather together the little ones, and them that suck the breasts." Much more therefore are all others bound to keen the fasts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things should be preferred to temporal, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things to those that are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Now bodily works are directed to temporal gain; and pilgrimages, though directed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, are not a matter of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is directed to a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> gain, and is made a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> thing by the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it seems that the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought not to be omitted on account of a pilgrimage, or bodily works.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is better to do a thing willingly than through <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>. Now the poor are wont to fast through <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, owing to lack of food. Much more therefore ought they to fast willingly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It seems that no righteous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is bound to fast. For the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not binding in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse34">Luke 5:34</a>) that "the children of the bridegroom cannot fast whilst the bridegroom is with them [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast, whilst the bridegroom is with them?']." Now He is with all the righteous by dwelling in them in a special manner [Cf. I, 8, 3], wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a>): "Behold I am with you . . . even to the consummation of the world." Therefore the righteous are not bound by the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to fast.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 90, 2; I-II, 98, 2,6), general precepts are framed according to the requirements of the many. Wherefore in making such precepts the lawgiver considers what happens generally and for the most part, and he does not intend the precept to be binding on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in whom for some special reason there is something incompatible with observance of the precept. Yet discretion must be brought to bear on the point. For if the reason be evident, it is lawful for a man to use his own judgment in omitting to fulfil the precept, especially if custom be in his favor, or if it be difficult for him to have recourse to superior authority. on the other hand, if the reason be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, one should have recourse to the superior who has power to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in such cases. And this must be done in the fasts appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which all are bound in general, unless there be some special obstacle to this observance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are precepts of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, which are, of themselves, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are about matters which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not of themselves, but only through the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence there may be certain obstacles on account of which certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not bound to keep the fasts in question.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In children there is a most evident reason for not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, both on account of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> weakness, owing to which they need to take food frequently, and not much at a time, and because they need much nourishment owing to the demands of growth, which results from the residuum of nourishment. Wherefore as long as the stage of growth lasts, which as a rule lasts until they have completed the third period of seven years, they are not bound to keep the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> fasts: and yet it is fitting that even during that time they should exercise themselves in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, more or less, in accordance with their age. Nevertheless when some great calamity threatens, even children are commanded to fast, in sign of more severe penance, according to <a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse7">Jonah 3:7</a>, "Let neither men nor beasts . . . taste anything . . . nor drink water."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Apparently a distinction should be made with regard to <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and working people. For if the pilgrimage or laborious work can be conveniently deferred or lessened without detriment to the bodily health and such external <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the upkeep of bodily or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, there is no reason for omitting the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if one be under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of starting on the pilgrimage at once, and of making long stages, or of doing much work, either for one's bodily livelihood, or for some need of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, and it be impossible at the same time to keep the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one is not bound to fast: because in ordering fasts the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not seem to have intended to prevent other pious and more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> undertakings. Nevertheless, in such cases one ought seemingly, to seek the superior's dispensation; except perhaps when the above course is recognized by custom, since when superiors are silent they would seem to consent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Those poor who can provide themselves with sufficient for one meal are not excused, on account of <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, from keeping the fasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On the other hand, those would seem to be exempt who beg their food piecemeal, since they are unable at any one time to have a sufficiency of food.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> may be expounded in three ways. First, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxx in Matth.), who says that "the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who are called children of the bridegroom, were as yet of a weakly disposition, wherefore they are compared to an old garment." Hence while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was with them in body they were to be fostered with kindness rather than drilled with the harshness of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. According to this interpretation, it is fitting that dispensations should be granted to the imperfect and to beginners, rather than to the elders and the perfect, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa130.htm#verse2">Psalm 130:2</a>, "As a child that is weaned is towards his mother." Secondly, we may say with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Comment. in Luc. v] that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is speaking here of the fasts of the observances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> means to say that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were not to be held back by the old observances, since they were to be filled with the newness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Thirdly, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Consensu Evang. ii, 27), who states that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is of two kinds. one pertains to those who are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> by disquietude, and this is not befitting perfect men, for they are called "children of the bridegroom"; hence when we read in Luke: "The children of the bridegroom cannot fast [Hom. xiii, in Matth.]," we read in <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse15">Matthew 9:15</a>: "The children of the bridegroom cannot mourn [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Can the children of the bridegroom mourn?']." The other pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that rejoices in adhering to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things: and this <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is befitting the perfect.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the times for the Church fast are fittingly ascribed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the times for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> fast are unfittingly appointed. For we read (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm">Matthew 4</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to fast immediately after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Now we ought to imitate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>, "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Therefore we ought to fast immediately after the Epiphany when Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is celebrated.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is unlawful in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> to observe the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Now it belongs to the solemnities of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> to fast in certain particular months: for it is written (<a href="../bible/zec008.htm#verse19">Zechariah 8:19</a>): "The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and gladness and great solemnities." Therefore the fast of certain months, which are called Ember days, are unfittingly kept in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Consensu Evang. ii, 27), just as there is a fast "of sorrow," so is there a fast "of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>." Now it is most becoming that the faithful should rejoice spiritually in <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a>. Therefore during the five weeks which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> solemnizes on account of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a>, and on Sundays which commemorate the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, fasts ought to be appointed.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the general custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 3), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is directed to two things, the deletion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the raising of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to heavenly things. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> ought to be appointed specially for those times, when it behooves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be cleansed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to be raised to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by devotion: and these things are particularly requisite before the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is solemnly conferred on Easter-eve, on which day <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> burial is commemorated, because "we are buried together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> unto death" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans 6:4</a>). Moreover at the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to be devoutly raised to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> restored by rising from the dead, and so the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ordered a fast to be observed immediately before the Paschal feast; and for the same reason, on the eve of the chief festivals, because it is then that one ought to make ready to keep the coming feast devoutly. Again it is the custom in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> to be conferred every quarter of the year (in sign whereof <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> fed four thousand men with seven loaves, which signify the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> year as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Comment. in Marc. viii]): and then both the ordainer, and the candidates for ordination, and even the whole people, for whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they are ordained, need to fast in order to make themselves ready for the ordination. Hence it is related (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke 6:12</a>) that before choosing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> "went out into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>": and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [Exposit. in Luc.] commenting on these words says: "What shouldst thou do, when thou desirest to undertake some pious work, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> before sending His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>?"

<p>With regard to the forty day's fast, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. xvi in Evang.) there are three reasons for the number. First, "because the power of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> is accomplished in the four books of the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: since forty is the product of ten multiplied by four." Or "because we are composed of four elements in this mortal body through whose lusts we transgress the Lord's commandments which are delivered to us in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. Wherefore it is fitting we should punish that same body forty times. or, because, just as under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> it was commanded that <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> should be paid of things, so we strive to pay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of days, for since a year is composed of three hundred and sixty-six days, by punishing ourselves for thirty-six days" (namely, the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> days during the six weeks of Lent) "we pay <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of our year." According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 16) a fourth reason may be added. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> is the "<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>," Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: while the number "three" refers to the invisible creature, since we are commanded to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with our whole heart, with our whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with our whole mind: and the number "four" refers to the visible creature, by reason of heat, cold, wet and dry. Thus the number "ten" [Ten is the sum of three, three, and four] signifies all things, and if this be multiplied by four which refers to the body whereby we make use of things, we have the number forty. Each fast of the Ember days is composed of three days, on account of the number of months in each season: or on account of the number of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> which are conferred at these times.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> needed not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for His own sake, but in order to commend <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to us. Wherefore it was competent for Him to fast, not before, but after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in order to invite us to fast before our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Church keeps the Ember fasts, neither at the very same time as the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, nor for the same reasons. For they fasted in July, which is the fourth month from April (which they count as the first), because it was then that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> coming down from <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> broke the tables of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus 32</a>), and that, according to <a href="../bible/jer039.htm#verse2">Jeremiah 39:2</a>, "the walls of the city were first broken through." On the fifth month, which we call August, they fasted because they were commanded not to go up on to the mountain, when the people had rebelled on account of the spies (<a href="../bible/num014.htm">Numbers 14</a>): also in this month the temple of Jerusalem was burnt down by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> (<a href="../bible/jer052.htm">Jeremiah 52</a>) and afterwards by <a href="../cathen/14746b.htm">Titus</a>. On the seventh month which we call October, Godolias was slain, and the remnants of the people were dispersed (<a href="../bible/jer051.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>). On the tenth month, which we call January, the people who were with <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> in captivity heard of the destruction of the temple (<a href="../bible/eze004.htm">Ezekiel 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>" proceeds from the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of liberty, wherefore this <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> should not be a matter of precept. Accordingly the fasts appointed by the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are rather "fasts of sorrow" which are inconsistent with days of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not ordered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the whole of the Paschal season, nor on Sundays: and if anyone were to fast at these times in contradiction to the custom of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, which as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Ep. xxxvi) "is to be considered as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>," or even through some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinion (thus the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a> fast, because they deem such <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to be of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>)--he would not be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> considered in itself is commendable at all times; thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> wrote (Ad Lucin., Ep. lxxi): "Would that we might fast always."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether it is requisite for fasting that one eat but once?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it is not requisite for <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> that one eat but once. For, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence, which observes due <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of food not less than the number of meals. Now the <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of food is not limited for those who fast. Therefore neither should the number of meals be limited.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is nourished by meat, so is he by drink: wherefore drink breaks the fast, and for this reason we cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> after drinking. Now we are not forbidden to drink at various hours of the day. Therefore those who fast should not be forbidden to eat several times.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, digestives are a kind of food: and yet many take them on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> days after eating. Therefore it is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to take only one meal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the common custom of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Fasting is instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in order to bridle <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, yet so as to safeguard <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now only one meal is seemingly sufficient for this purpose, since thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to satisfy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and yet he withdraws something from <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> by minimizing the number of meals. Therefore it is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in her moderation, that those who fast should take one meal in the day.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It was not possible to fix the same <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of food for all, on account of the various bodily temperaments, the result being that one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> needs more, and another less food: whereas, for the most part, all are able to satisfy <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by only one meal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fasting is of two kinds [Cf. 1, ad 3]. One is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> fast, which is requisite for receiving the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. This is broken by any kind of drink, even of water, after which it is not lawful to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. The fast of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is another kind and is called the "<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of the faster," and this is not broken save by such things as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intended to forbid in instituting the fast. Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not intend to command abstinence from drink, for this is taken more for bodily refreshment, and digestion of the food consumed, although it nourishes somewhat. It is, however, possible to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and lose the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, by partaking of too much drink: as also by eating immoderately at one meal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although digestives nourish somewhat they are not taken chiefly for nourishment, but for digestion. Hence one does not break one's fast by taking them or any other medicines, unless one were to take digestives, with a fraudulent <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, in great <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> and by way of food.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the ninth hour is suitably fixed for the faster's meal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the ninth hour is not suitably fixed for the faster's meal. For the state of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">New Law</a> is more perfect than the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> they fasted until evening, for it is written (<a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse32">Leviticus 23:32</a>): "It is a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> . . . you shall afflict your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," and then the text continues: "From evening until evening you shall celebrate your sabbaths." Much more therefore under the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> should the fast be ordered until the evening.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the fast ordered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is binding on all. But all are not able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly the ninth hour. Therefore it seems that the fixing of the ninth hour should not form part of the commandment to fast.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now the mean of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not apply in the same way to all, since what is much for one is little for another, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. Therefore the ninth hour should not be fixed for those who fast.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The Council of Chalons [The quotation is from the Capitularies (Cap. 39) of Theodulf, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Orleans (760-821) and is said to be found in the Corpus Juris, Cap. Solent, dist. 1, De Consecratione] says: "During Lent those are by no means to be credited with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> who eat before the celebration of the office of Vespers," which in the Lenten season is said after the ninth hour. Therefore we ought to fast until the ninth hour.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 3,5), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is directed to the deletion and prevention of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence it ought to add something to the common custom, yet so as not to be a heavy burden to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the right and common custom is for men to eat about the sixth hour: both because digestion is seemingly finished (the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat being withdrawn inwardly at night-time on account of the surrounding cold of the night), and the humor spread about through the limbs (to which result the heat of the day conduces until the sun has reached its zenith), and again because it is then chiefly that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body needs assistance against the external heat that is in the air, lest the humors be parched within. Hence, in order that those who fast may feel some pain in satisfaction for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the ninth hour is suitably fixed for their meal.

<p>Moreover, this hour agrees with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, which was brought to a close at the ninth hour, when "bowing His head, He gave up the ghost" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse30">John 19:30</a>): because those who fast by punishing their flesh, are conformed to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians 5:24</a>, "They that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh with the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The state of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is compared to the night, while the state of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is compared to the day, according to <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans 13:12</a>, "The night is passed and the day is at hand." Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> they fasted until night, but not in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fasting requires a fixed hour based, not on a strict calculation, but on a rough estimate: for it suffices that it be about the ninth hour, and this is easy for anyone to ascertain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A little more or a little less cannot do much harm. Now it is not a long space of time from the sixth hour at which men for the most part are wont to eat, until the ninth hour, which is fixed for those who fast. Wherefore the fixing of such a time cannot do much harm to anyone, whatever his circumstances may be. If however this were to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> a heavy burden to a man on account of sickness, age, or some similar reason, he should be dispensed from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, or be allowed to forestall the hour by a little.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether it is fitting that those who fast should be bidden to abstain from flesh meat, eggs, and milk foods?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting that those who fast should be bidden to abstain from flesh meat, eggs, and milk foods. For it has been stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>) that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> was instituted as a curb on the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh. Now <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is kindled by drinking wine more than by eating flesh; according to <a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse1">Proverbs 20:1</a>, "Wine is a luxurious thing," and <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians 5:18</a>, "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury." Since then those who fast are not forbidden to drink wine, it seems that they should not be forbidden to eat flesh meat.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some fish are as delectable to eat as the flesh of certain animals. Now "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is desire of the delectable," as stated above (I-II, 30, 1). Therefore since <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> which was instituted in order to bridle <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> does not exclude the eating of fish, neither should it exclude the eating of flesh meat.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, on certain <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> days people make use of eggs and cheese. Therefore one can likewise make use of them during the Lenten fast.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the common custom of the faithful.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>), <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in order to bridle the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the flesh, which regard pleasures of touch in connection with food and sex. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbade those who fast to partake of those foods which both afford most pleasure to the palate, and besides are a very great incentive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Such are the flesh of animals that take their rest on the earth, and of those that breathe the air and their products, such as milk from those that walk on the earth, and eggs from birds. For, since such like animals are more like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in body, they afford greater pleasure as food, and greater nourishment to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has bidden those who fast to abstain especially from these foods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Three things concur in the act of procreation, namely, heat, spirit [Cf. P. I., Q. 118, 1, ad 3], and humor. Wine and other things that heat the body conduce especially to heat: flatulent foods seemingly cooperate in the production of the vital spirit: but it is chiefly the use of flesh meat which is most productive of nourishment, that conduces to the production of humor. Now the alteration occasioned by heat, and the increase in vital spirits are of short duration, whereas the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the humor remains a long time. Hence those who fast are forbidden the use of flesh meat rather than of wine or vegetables which are flatulent foods.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In the institution of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> takes account of the more common occurrences. Now, generally speaking, eating flesh meat affords more pleasure than eating fish, although this is not always the case. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbade those who fast to eat flesh meat, rather than to eat fish.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Eggs and milk foods are forbidden to those who fast, for as much as they originate from animals that provide us with flesh: wherefore the prohibition of flesh meat takes precedence of the prohibition of eggs and milk foods. Again the Lenten fast is the most <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> of all, both because it is kept in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and because it disposes us to celebrate devoutly the mysteries of our redemption. For this reason the eating of flesh meat is forbidden in every fast, while the Lenten fast lays a general prohibition even on eggs and milk foods. As to the use of the latter things in other fasts the custom varies among different people, and each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to conform to that custom which is in vogue with those among whom he is dwelling. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Lib. Arb. iii, 18; cf. De Nat. et Grat. lxvii]: "Let each province keep to its own practice, and look upon the commands of the elders as though they were the laws of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>."
