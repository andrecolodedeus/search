<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether gluttony is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>): "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man." Now <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> regards food which goes into a man. Therefore, since every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> defiles a man, it seems that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid" [Ep. lxxi, ad Lucin.]. Now <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is immoderation in food; and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot avoid this, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxx, 18): "Since in eating pleasure and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> go together, we fail to discern between the call of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> and the seduction of pleasure," and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 31): "Who is it, Lord, that does not eat a little more than <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>?" Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the first movement is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the first movement in taking food is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, else hunger and thirst would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxx, 18) that "unless we first tame the enemy dwelling within us, namely our gluttonous <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, we have not even stood up to engage in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> combat." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> inward enemy is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Gluttony denotes, not any desire of eating and drinking, but an inordinate desire. Now desire is said to be inordinate through leaving the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists: and a thing is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through being contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That which goes into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by way of food, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, does not defile a man spiritually. But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, against whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is speaking, and the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a> deemed certain foods to make a man <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, not on account of their signification, but by reason of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> [Cf. I-II, 102, 6, ad 1]. It is the inordinate desire of food that defiles a man spiritually.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> does not regard the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of food, but in the desire thereof not being regulated by reason. Wherefore if a man exceed in <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of food, not from desire of food, but through deeming it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to him, this pertains, not to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, but to some kind of inexperience. It is a case of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> only when a man knowingly exceeds the measure in eating, from a desire for the pleasures of the palate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is twofold. There is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which belongs to the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. On these powers <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are impossible, since they cannot be subject to reason; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is differentiated from the powers of secretion, digestion, and excretion, and to it hunger and thirst are to be referred. Besides this there is another, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and it is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of this <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> consists. Hence the first movement of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> denotes inordinateness in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and this is not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether gluttony is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>: and this, apparently, does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 132, Article 3). But <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, neither as regards the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor as regards the love of one's neighbor. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is never a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a sermon on <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> [Cf. Append. to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> works: Serm. civ (xli, de sanctis)]: "Whenever a man takes more meat and drink than is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is one of the lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." But this pertains to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is accounted among the lesser, that is to say venial, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxx, 18): "As long as the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> has a hold on a man, all that he has done valiantly is forfeited by him: and as long as the belly is unrestrained, all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comes to naught." But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not done away save by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> properly consists in inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Now the order of reason in regulating the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> may be considered from two points of view. First, with regard to things directed to the end, inasmuch as they may be incommensurate and consequently improportionate to the end; secondly, with regard to the end itself, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from his due end. Accordingly, if the inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> be found to turn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from the last end, <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is the case when he adheres to the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> as his end, for the sake of which he contemns <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being ready to disobey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments, in order to obtain those pleasures. On the other hand, if the inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> be found to affect only such things as are directed to the end, for instance when a man has too great a desire for the pleasures of the palate, yet would not for their sake do anything contrary to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> becomes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by turning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from his last end: and accordingly, by a kind of reduction, it is opposed to the precept of hallowing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, which commands us to rest in our last end. For mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not all directly opposed to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, but only those which contain <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>: because the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> pertain specially to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and its parts, as stated above (Question 122, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In so far as it turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from his last end, <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is opposed to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is to be loved, as our last end, above all things: and only in this respect is <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> refers to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> as denoting inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> merely in regard of things directed to the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Gluttony is said to bring <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to naught, not so much on its own account, as on account of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which arise from it. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. iii, 19): "When the belly is distended by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are destroyed by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether gluttony is the greatest of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the grievousness of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured by the grievousness of the punishment. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is most grievously punished, for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xiii in Matth.]: "Gluttony turned <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of Paradise, <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> it was that drew down the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>." According to <a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse49">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, "This was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of Sodom, thy sister . . . fulness of bread," etc. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is the greatest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every genus the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the most powerful. Now <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is apparently the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse10">Psalm 135:10</a>, "Who smote <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with their <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>," says: "Lust, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> are the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should love himself in the first place after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 25, Article 4). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, inflicts an injury on himself: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir037.htm#verse34">Sirach 37:34</a>): "By surfeiting many have perished." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, at least excepting those that are against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, among which <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is reckoned, are less culpable according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxiii).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be measured in three ways. First and foremost it depends on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed: and in this way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in connection with Divine things are the greatest. From this point of view <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is about matters connected with the nourishment of the body. Secondly, the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and from this point of view the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is diminished rather than aggravated, both on account of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of taking food, and on account of the difficulty of proper discretion and moderation in such matters. Thirdly, from the point of view of the result that follows, and in this way <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> has a certain gravity, inasmuch as certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are occasioned thereby.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These punishments are to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that resulted from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, or to the root from which <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> sprang, rather than to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> itself. For the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was expelled from Paradise on account of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, from which he went on to an act of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a> and the punishment of the people of Sodom were inflicted for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> occasioned by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This objection argues from the standpoint of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that result from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Nor is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> more powerful, unless it be a direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as it were, and the occasion of other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> intends, not the harm to his body, but the pleasure of eating: and if injury results to his body, this is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>. Hence this does not directly affect the gravity of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, the guilt of which is nevertheless aggravated, if a man incur some bodily injury through taking too much food.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the species of gluttony are fittingly distinguished?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> are unfittingly distinguished by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> who says (Moral. xxx, 18): "The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> tempts us in five ways. Sometimes it forestalls the hour of need; sometimes it seeks costly meats; sometimes it requires the food to be daintily cooked; sometimes it exceeds the measure of refreshment by taking too much; sometimes we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the very heat of an immoderate <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>"--which are contained in the following verse: "Hastily, sumptuously, too much, greedily, daintily."

<p>For the above are distinguished according to diversity of circumstance. Now circumstances, being the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> of an act, do not differentiate its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> are not distinguished according to the aforesaid.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as time is a circumstance, so is place. If then <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> admits of one <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in respect of time, it seems that there should likewise be others in respect of place and other circumstances.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> observes due circumstances, so do the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to the other moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not distinguished according to various circumstances. Neither, therefore, are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> distinguished thus.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> quoted above.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> denotes inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in eating. Now two things are to be considered in eating, namely the food we eat, and the eating thereof. Accordingly, the inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> may be considered in two ways. First, with regard to the food consumed: and thus, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of food a man seeks "sumptuous"--i.e. costly food; as regards its <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, he seeks food prepared too nicely--i.e. "daintily"; and as regards <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, he exceeds by eating "too much."

<p>Secondly, the inordinate <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is considered as to the consumption of food: either because one forestalls the proper time for eating, which is to eat "hastily," or one fails to observe the due manner of eating, by eating "greedily."

<p><a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> [De Summo Bon. ii, 42 comprises the first and second under one heading, when he says that the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> exceeds in "what" he eats, or in "how much," "how" or "when he eats."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The corruption of various circumstances <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, on account of the various motives, by reason of which the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of moral things are differentiated. For in him that seeks sumptuous food, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is aroused by the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the food; in him that forestalls the time <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is disordered through impatience of delay, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Place and other circumstances include no special motive connected with eating, that can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In all other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, whenever different circumstances correspond to different motives, the difference of circumstances argues a specific difference of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: but this does not apply to all circumstances, as stated above (I-II, 72, 09).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether gluttony is a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> denote those whence, under the aspect of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> originate. Now food, which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, has not the aspect of end, since it is sought, not for its own sake, but for the body's nourishment. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> would seem to have a certain pre-eminence in sinfulness. But this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, which, in respect of its genus, is apparently the least of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing that it is most akin to what is in respect of its genus, is apparently the least <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> results from a man forsaking the food of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on account of something useful to the present life, or pleasing to the senses. Now as regards goods having the aspect of utility, there is but one capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore, seemingly, there would be but one capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in respect of pleasures: and this is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is a greater <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> than <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, and is about greater pleasures. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 84, 3), a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> denotes one from which, considered as final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. as having a most desirable end, other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> originate: wherefore through desiring that end men are incited to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in many ways. Now an end is rendered most desirable through having one of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which is desirable by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and pleasure is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to Ethic. i, 8; x, 3,7,8. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, being about pleasures of touch which stand foremost among other pleasures, is fittingly reckoned among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that food itself is directed to something as its end: but since that end, namely the sustaining of life, is most desirable and whereas life cannot be sustained without food, it follows that food too is most desirable: indeed, nearly all the toil of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is directed thereto, according to <a href="../bible/ecc006.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a>, "All the labor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is for his mouth." Yet <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> seems to be about pleasures of food rather than about food itself; wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. liii), "with such food as is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the worthless body, men desire to be fed," wherein namely the pleasure consists, "rather than to be filled: since the whole end of that desire is this--not to thirst and not to hunger."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the end is ascertained with respect to the conversion, while the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is determined with regard to the aversion. Wherefore it does not follow that the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has the most desirable end surpasses the others in gravity.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which gives pleasure is desirable in itself: and consequently corresponding to its diversity there are two capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. On the other hand, that which is useful is desirable, not in itself, but as directed to something else: wherefore seemingly in all useful things there is one aspect of desirability. Hence there is but one capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, in respect of such things.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether six daughters are fittingly assigned to gluttony?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that six daughters are unfittingly assigned to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, to wit, "unseemly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, scurrility, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, loquaciousness, and dullness of mind as regards the understanding." For unseemly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> results from every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>, "Who are glad when they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rejoice in most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things." Likewise dullness of mind is associated with every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse22">Proverbs 14:22</a>, "They <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Therefore they are unfittingly reckoned to be daughters of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> which is particularly the result of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> would seem to be connected with vomiting, according to <a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse8">Isaiah 28:8</a>, "All tables were full of vomit and filth." But this seems to be not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but a punishment; or even a useful thing that is a matter of counsel, according to <a href="../bible/sir031.htm#verse25">Sirach 31:25</a>, "If thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, go out, and vomit; and it shall refresh thee." Therefore it should not be reckoned among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> (QQ. in Deut. xvi) reckons scurrility as a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore it should not be reckoned among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns these daughters to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2,3), <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> consists properly in an immoderate pleasure in eating and drinking. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are reckoned among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, which are the results of eating and drinking immoderately. These may be accounted for either on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or on the part of the body. on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> these results are of four kinds. First, as regards the reason, whose keenness is dulled by immoderate meat and drink, and in this respect we reckon as a daughter of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, "dullness of sense in the understanding," on account of the fumes of food disturbing the brain. Even so, on the other hand, abstinence conduces to the penetrating power of wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/ecc002.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>, "I thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind in wisdom." Secondly, as regards the. <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is disordered in many ways by immoderation in eating and drinking, as though reason were fast asleep at the helm, and in this respect "unseemly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>" is reckoned, because all the other inordinate <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are directed to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow, as stated in Ethic. ii, 5. To this we must refer the saying of 3 Esdra 3:20, that "wine . . . gives every one a confident and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a> mind." Thirdly, as regards inordinate words, and thus we have "loquaciousness," because as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. iii, 19), "unless <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> were carried away by immoderate speech, that rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is stated to have feasted sumptuously every day would not have been so tortured in his tongue." Fourthly, as regards inordinate action, and in this way we have "scurrility," i.e. a kind of levity resulting from lack of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is unable not only to bridle the speech, but also to restrain outward behavior. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse4">Ephesians 5:4</a>, "Or foolish talking or scurrility," says that "fools call this geniality--i.e. jocularity, because it is wont to raise a laugh." Both of these, however, may be referred to the words which may happen to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, either by reason of excess which belongs to "loquaciousness," or by reason of unbecomingness, which belongs to "scurrility."

<p>On the part of the body, mention is made of "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>," which may refer either to the inordinate emission of any kind of superfluities, or especially to the emission of the semen. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ephesians 5:3</a>, "But fornication and all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>," says: "That is, any kind of incontinence that has reference to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Joy in the act or end of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> results from every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that proceeds from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but the random riotous <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is described as "unseemly" arises chiefly from immoderate partaking of meat or drink. On like manner, we reply that dullness of sense as regards matters of choice is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereas dullness of sense in speculative matters arises chiefly from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, for the reason given above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it does one <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to vomit after eating too much, yet it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to expose oneself to its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> by immoderate meat or drink. However, it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to procure vomiting as a remedy for sickness if the physician prescribes it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Scurrility proceeds from the act of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, and not from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> act, but from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> will: wherefore it may be referred to either <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.
