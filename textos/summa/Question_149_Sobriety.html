<h1>Question 149. Sobriety</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3149.htm#article1"> What is the matter of sobriety?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3149.htm#article2"> Is it a special virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3149.htm#article3"> Is the use of wine lawful?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3149.htm#article4"> To whom especially is sobriety becoming?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether drink is the matter of sobriety?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that drink is not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> proper to sobriety. For it is written (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans 12:3</a>): "Not to be more wise than it behooveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety." Therefore sobriety is also about wisdom, and not only about drink.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, concerning the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is written (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse7">Wisdom 8:7</a>) that "she teacheth sobriety [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>'], and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>," where sobriety stands for <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about drink, but also about meat and sexual matters. Therefore sobriety is not only about drink.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sobriety would seem to take its name from "measure" ['Bria,' a measure, a cup; Cf. Facciolati and Forcellini's Lexicon]. Now we ought to be guided by the measure in all things appertaining to us: for it is written (<a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse12">Titus 2:12</a>): "We should live soberly and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and godly," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> remarks: "Soberly, in ourselves"; and (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 2:9</a>): "Women . . . in decent apparel, adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety." Consequently it would seem that sobriety regards not only the interior <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also things appertaining to external apparel. Therefore drink is not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> proper to sobriety.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir031.htm#verse32">Sirach 31:32</a>): "Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is denominated from some <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> common to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> specially belonging to it is that in which it is most difficult and most commendable to satisfy that <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about dangers of death, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> about pleasures of touch. Now sobriety takes its name from "measure," for a man is said to be sober because he observes the "bria," i.e. the measure. Wherefore sobriety lays a special claim to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein the observance of the measure is most deserving of praise. Such <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the drinking of intoxicants, because the measured use thereof is most profitable, while immoderate excess therein is most harmful, since it hinders the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> even more than excessive eating. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir031.htm#verse37">Sirach 31:37-38</a>): "Sober drinking is health to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; wine <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath and many ruins." For this reason sobriety is especially concerned with drink, not any kind of drink, but that which by reason of its volatility is liable to disturb the brain, such as wine and all intoxicants. Nevertheless, sobriety may be employed in a general sense so as to apply to any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (123, 2; 141, 2) with regard to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the material wine intoxicates a man as to his body, so too, speaking figuratively, the consideration of wisdom is said to be an inebriating draught, because it allures the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> by its delight, according to <a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse5">Psalm 22:5</a>, "My <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> which inebriateth me, how goodly is it!" Hence sobriety is applied by a kind of metaphor in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of wisdom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All the things that belong properly to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the present life, and their excess is harmful. Wherefore it behooves one to apply a measure in all such things. This is the business of sobriety: and for this reason sobriety is used to designate <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Yet slight excess is more harmful in drink than in other things, wherefore sobriety is especially concerned with drink.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although a measure is needful in all things, sobriety is not properly employed in connection with all things, but only in those wherein there is most need for a measure.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether sobriety is by itself a special virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sobriety is not by itself a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For abstinence is concerned with both meat and drink. Now there is no special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about meat. Therefore neither is sobriety, which is about drink, a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, abstinence and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> are about pleasures of touch as sensitive to food. Now meat and drink combine together to make food, since an animal needs a combination of wet and dry nourishment. Therefore sobriety, which is about drink, is not a. special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as in things pertaining to nourishment, drink is distinguished from meat, so are there various kinds of meats and of drinks. Therefore if sobriety is by itself a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, seemingly there will be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> corresponding to each different kind of meat or drink, which is unreasonable. Therefore it would seem that sobriety is not a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somno Scip. i, 8 reckons sobriety to be a special part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 146, Article 2), it belongs to moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason against those things which may hinder it. Hence wherever we find a special hindrance to reason, there must needs be a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to remove it. Now intoxicating drink is a special kind of hindrance to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, inasmuch as it disturbs the brain by its fumes. Wherefore in order to remove this hindrance to reason a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is sobriety, is requisite.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Meat and drink are alike capable of hindering the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, by embroiling the reason with immoderate pleasure: and in this respect abstinence is about both meat and drink alike. But intoxicating drink is a special kind of hindrance, as stated above, wherefore it requires a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of abstinence is about meat and drink, considered, not as food but as a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence it does not follow that special kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> correspond to different kinds of food.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In all intoxicating drinks there is one kind of hindrance to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: so that the difference of drinks bears an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> relation to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence this difference does not call for a difference of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The same applies to the difference of meats.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the use of wine is altogether unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the use of wine is altogether unlawful. For without wisdom, a man cannot be in the state of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: since it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse28">Wisdom 7:28</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom," and further on (<a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse19">Wisdom 9:19</a>): "By wisdom they were healed, whosoever have pleased Thee, O Lord, from the beginning." Now the use of wine is a hindrance to wisdom, for it is written (<a href="../bible/ecc002.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>): "I thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom." Therefore wine-drinking is altogether unlawful.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse21">Romans 14:21</a>): "It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, or made weak." Now it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to forsake the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as likewise to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one's brethren. Therefore it is unlawful to make use of wine.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Contra Jovin. i] that "after the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a> wine and flesh were sanctioned: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came in the last of the ages and brought back the end into line with the beginning." Therefore it seems unlawful to use wine under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1 Timothy 5:23</a>): "Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thy frequent infirmities"; and it is written (<a href="../bible/sir031.htm#verse36">Sirach 31:36</a>): "Wine <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> with moderation is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the heart."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> No meat or drink, considered in itself, is unlawful, according to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew 15:11</a>, "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man." Wherefore it is not unlawful to drink wine as such. Yet it may become unlawful <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. This is sometimes owing to a circumstance on the part of the drinker, either because he is easily the worse for taking wine, or because he is bound by a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> not to drink wine: sometimes it results from the mode of drinking, because to wit he exceeds the measure in drinking: and sometimes it is on account of others who would be scandalized thereby.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may have wisdom in two ways. First, in a general way, according as it is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and in this way it is required, in order to have wisdom, not that a man abstain altogether from wine, but that he abstain from its immoderate use. Secondly, a man may have wisdom in some degree of perfection: and in this way, in order to receive wisdom perfectly, it is requisite for certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that they abstain altogether from wine, and this depends on circumstances of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and places.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> does not declare simply that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to abstain from wine, but that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the case where this would give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to certain people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> withdraws us from some things as being altogether unlawful, and from others as being obstacles to perfection. It is in the latter way that he withdraws some from the use of wine, that they may aim at perfection, even as from <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and the like.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether sobriety is more requisite in persons of greater standing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that sobriety is more requisite in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of greater standing. For old age gives a man a certain standing; wherefore <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and reverence are due to the old, according to <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse32">Leviticus 19:32</a>, "Rise up before the hoary head, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the aged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares that old men especially should be exhorted to sobriety, according to <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse2">Titus 2:2</a>, "That the aged <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be sober." Therefore sobriety is most requisite in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of standing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the highest degree in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> commands him to be sober, according to <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, "It behooveth . . . a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>," etc. Therefore sobriety is chiefly required in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of high standing.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, sobriety denotes abstinence from wine. Now wine is forbidden to kings, who hold the highest place in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs: while it is allowed to those who are in a state of affliction, according to <a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse4">Proverbs 31:4</a>, "Give not wine to kings," and further on (<a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse6">Proverbs 31:6</a>), "Give strong drink to them that are sad, and wine to them that are grieved in mind." Therefore sobriety is more requisite in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of standing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 3:11</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in like manner, chaste . . . sober," etc., and (<a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse6">Titus 2:6</a>) "Young men in like manner exhort that they be sober."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Virtue includes relationship to two things, to the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which it removes, and to the end to which it leads. Accordingly a particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more requisite in certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for two reasons. First, because they are more prone to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> which need to be restrained by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which are removed by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On this respect, sobriety is most requisite in the young and in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, because <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of pleasure thrives in the young on account of the heat of youth, while in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there is not sufficient strength of mind to resist <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Hence, according to Valerius Maximus [Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1 among the ancient Romans <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> drank no wine. Secondly, sobriety is more requisite in certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as being more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the operations proper to them. Now immoderate use of wine is a notable obstacle to the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore sobriety is specially prescribed to the old, in whom reason should be vigorous in instructing others: to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and all ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who should fulfil their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> duties with a devout mind; and to kings, who should rule their subjects with wisdom.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
