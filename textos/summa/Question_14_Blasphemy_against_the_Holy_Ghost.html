<h1>Question 14. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3014.htm#article1"> Is blasphemy or the sin against the Holy Ghost the same as the sin committed through certain malice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3014.htm#article2"> The species of this sin</a> <li><a href="../summa/3014.htm#article3"> Can it be forgiven?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3014.htm#article4"> Is it possible to begin by sinning against the Holy Ghost before committing other sins?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the sin against the Holy Ghost is the same as the sin committed through certain malice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain malice. Because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>. But not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: since many other kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through weakness: whereas the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is condivided with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, since things whose opposites differ, are themselves different.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is itself a generic <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having its own determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is not a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> or general circumstance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which can affect any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. ii, D, 43) that "to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is to take pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for its own sake." Now this is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is the same as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three meanings have been given to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the earlier <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (Super Matth. xii, 32), <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> (Can. xii in Matth.), <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> (Super Luc. xii, 10), <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Super Matth. xii), and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xli in Matth.), say that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is literally to utter a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whether by <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> we understand the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> name applicable to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, each Person of which is a Spirit and is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, or the personal name of one of the Persons of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, in which sense <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>), for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did certain things in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, by eating, drinking, and such like actions, while He did others in respect of His Godhead, by casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a>, raising the dead, and the like: which things He did both by the power of His own Godhead and by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of Whom He was full, according to his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> began by speaking <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, when they said (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse19">Matthew 11:19</a>) that He was "a <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">glutton</a> . . . a wine drinker," and a "friend of publicans": but afterwards they blasphemed against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when they ascribed to the prince of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> those works which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did by the power of His own Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and by the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi), says that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is final impenitence when, namely, a man perseveres in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until death, and that it is not confined to utterance by word of mouth, but extends to words in thought and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, not to one word only, but to many. Now this word, in this sense, is said to be uttered against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because it is contrary to the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> both of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Nor did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> say this to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as though they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, since they were not yet guilty of final impenitence, but He warned them, lest by similar utterances they should come to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and it is in this sense that we are to understand <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse29">Mark 3:29-30</a>, where after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> had said: "But he that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," etc. the Evangelist adds, "because they said: He hath an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit."

<p>But others understand it differently, and say that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: because <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, just a power is appropriated to the Father, and wisdom to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Hence they say that when a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through weakness, it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "against the Father"; that when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "against the Son"; and that when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, i.e. through the very choosing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as explained above (I-II, 78, 1,3), it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p>Now this may happen in two ways. First by reason of the very inclination of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> which we call <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and, in this way, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is not the same as to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. On another way it happens that by reason of contempt, that which might have prevented the choosing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is rejected or removed; thus hope is removed by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, and fear by presumption, and so on, as we shall explain further on (Q 20,21). Now all these things which prevent the choosing of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are effects of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in us; so that, in this sense, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in a protestation not only of words but also of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be uttered in word, thought and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the third interpretation, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, forasmuch as He is also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, i.e. the "power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). Wherefore, in this sense, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> will be that which is committed through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or through weakness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sin committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, in so far as it results from the inclination of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a general <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whereas, in so far as it results from a special contempt of an effect of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in us, it has the character of a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. According to this interpretation the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as also according to the first interpretation: whereas according to the second, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because final impenitence may be a circumstance of any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether it is fitting to distinguish six kinds of sin against the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem unfitting to distinguish six kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, presumption, impenitence, obstinacy, resisting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of our brother's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which are assigned by the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. ii, D, 43). For to deny <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or mercy belongs to unbelief. Now, by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, a man rejects <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, and by presumption, His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore each of these is a kind of unbelief rather than of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, impenitence, seemingly, regards past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while obstinacy regards future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now past and future time do not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, since it is the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born, and those of old <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He would be born. Therefore obstinacy and impenitence should not be reckoned as two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John 1:17</a>). Therefore it seem that resistance of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of a brother's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, belong to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Son rather than against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> says (De Dispens. et Praecept. xi) that "to refuse to obey is to resist the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Moreover a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse16">Leviticus 10:16</a>, says that "a feigned repentance is a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Again, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is, seemingly, directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by Whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is united together. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are insufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Fulgentius] (De Fide ad Petrum iii) says that "those who <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of pardon for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or who without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> presume on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," and (Enchiridion lxxxiii) that "he who dies in a state of obstinacy is guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," and (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi) that "impenitence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," and (De Serm. Dom. in Monte xxii), that "to resist fraternal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> with the brands of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," and in his book De unico Baptismo (De Bap. contra Donat. vi, 35) he says that "a man who spurns the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is either <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of his brethren to whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed, or ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whose inspiration the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is taught," and therefore, seemingly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The above <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are fittingly assigned to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> taken in the third sense, because they are distinguished in respect of the removal of contempt of those things whereby a man can be prevented from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> through choice. These things are either on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment, or on the part of His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, or on the part of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For, by consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">Divine judgment</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is accompanied with mercy, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is hindered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> through choice, both by hope, arising from the consideration of the mercy that pardons <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and rewards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which hope is removed by "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>"; and by fear, arising from the consideration of the Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that punishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which fear is removed by "presumption," when, namely, a man presumes that he can obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, or pardon without repentance.

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> whereby we are withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are two: one is the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, against which there is the "resistance of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," when, namely, a man resists the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he has acknowledged, in order to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more freely: while the other is the assistance of inward <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, against which there is "<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of a brother's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," when, namely, a man is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> not only of his brother's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but also of the increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> in the world.

<p>On the part of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there are two things which may withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> therefrom: one is the inordinateness and shamefulness of the act, the consideration of which is wont to arouse <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to repentance for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he has committed, and against this there is "impenitence," not as denoting permanence in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until death, in which sense it was taken above (for thus it would not be a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a circumstance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), but as denoting the purpose of not repenting. The other thing is the smallness or brevity of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is sought in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse21">Romans 6:21</a>: "What fruit had you therefore then in those things, of which you are now ashamed?" The consideration of this is wont to prevent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will from being hardened in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this is removed by "obstinacy," whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hardens his purpose by clinging to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Of these two it is written (<a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 8:6</a>): "There is none that doth penance for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, saying: What have I done?" as regards the first; and, "They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing to the battle," as regards the second.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and presumption consist, not in disbelieving in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy, but in contemning them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Obstinacy and impenitence differ not only in respect of past and future time, but also in respect of certain formal aspects by reason of the diverse consideration of those things which may be considered in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as explained above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which He gave to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> To refuse to obey belongs to obstinacy, while a feigned repentance belongs to impenitence, and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of a brother's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whereby the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are united together.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sin against the Holy Ghost can be forgiven?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be forgiven. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi): "We should <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so long as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> patience brings him back to repentance." But if any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven, it would be possible to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of some sinners. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be forgiven.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven, except through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being healed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But "no disease is incurable to an all-powerful physician," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse3">Psalm 102:3</a>, "Who healeth all thy diseases." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be forgiven.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is indifferent to either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now, so long as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a wayfarer, he can fall away from any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> fell from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/job004.htm#verse18">Job 4:18-19</a>): "In His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> He found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: how much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay?" Therefore, in like manner, a man can return from any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can be forgiven.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a>): "He that shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 22) that "so great is the downfall of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it cannot submit to the humiliation of asking for pardon."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the various interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, there are various ways in which it may be said that it cannot be forgiven. For if by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> we understand final impenitence, it is said to be unpardonable, since in no way is it pardoned: because the mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wherein a man perseveres until death will not be forgiven in the life to come, since it was not remitted by repentance in this life.

<p>According to the other two interpretations, it is said to be unpardonable, not as though it is nowise forgiven, but because, considered in itself, it deserves not to be pardoned: and this in two ways. First, as regards the punishment, since he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness, deserves less punishment, whereas he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, can offer no excuse in alleviation of his punishment. Likewise those who blasphemed against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> before His Godhead was revealed, could have some excuse, on account of the weakness of the flesh which they perceived in Him, and hence, they deserved less punishment; whereas those who blasphemed against His very Godhead, by ascribing to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the works of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, had no excuse in diminution of their punishment. Wherefore, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> commentary (Hom. xlii in Matth.), the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> are said not to be forgiven this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither in this world nor in the world to come, because they were punished for it, both in the present life, through the Romans, and in the life to come, in the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Thus also <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> adduces the example of their forefathers who, first of all, wrangled with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on account of the shortage of water and bread; and this the Lord bore with patience, because they were to be excused on account of the weakness of the flesh: but afterwards they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously when, by ascribing to an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> the favors bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who had brought them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, they blasphemed, so to speak, against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, saying (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse4">Exodus 32:4</a>): "These are thy gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that have brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>." Therefore the Lord both inflicted temporal punishment on them, since "there were slain on that day about three and twenty thousand men" (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse28">Exodus 32:28</a>), and threatened them with punishment in the life to come, saying, (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse34">Exodus 32:34</a>): "I, in the day of revenge, will visit this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> . . . of theirs."

<p>Secondly, this may be understood to refer to the guilt: thus a disease is said to be incurable in respect of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the disease, which removes whatever might be a means of cure, as when it takes away the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> loathing for food and medicine, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to cure such a disease. So too, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is said to be unpardonable, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in so far as it removes those things which are a means towards the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This does not, however, close the way of forgiveness and healing to an all-powerful and merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, sometimes, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, so to speak, restores <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> health to such men.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We should <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this life, considering <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence and mercy. But if we consider the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, some are called (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians 2:2</a>) "children of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>" ['Filios diffidentiae,' which the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> renders 'children of unbelief.'].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the question on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence, not on that of the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In this life the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> does indeed ever remain subject to change: yet sometimes it rejects that whereby, so far as it is concerned, it can be turned to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence considered in itself this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unpardonable, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can pardon it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man can sin first of all against the Holy Ghost?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> first of all against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, without having previously committed other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order requires that one should be moved to perfection from imperfection. This is evident as regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, according to <a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse18">Proverbs 4:18</a>: "The path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards and increases even to perfect day." Now, in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, the perfect is the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Metaph. v, text. 21). Since then the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> comes to commit this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through committing lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, or through choice. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot do this until he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> many times; for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. v, 6,9) that "although a man is able to do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, yet he cannot all at once do them as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does," viz. from choice. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot be committed except after other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, repentance and impenitence are about the same object.

<p>But there is no repentance, except about past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore the same applies to impenitence which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> presupposes other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "It is easy in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on a sudden to make a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rich" (<a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse23">Sirach 11:23</a>). Therefore, conversely, it is possible for a man, according to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who tempts him, to be led to commit the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which is that against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), in one way, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. Now one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in two ways, as stated in the same place: first, through the inclination of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but this is not, properly speaking, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, nor does a man come to commit this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> all at once, in as much as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts must precede so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that induces to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, by contemptuously rejecting the things whereby a man is withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is, properly speaking, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>); and this also, for the most part, presupposes other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse3">Proverbs 18:3</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when he is come into the depth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, contemneth."

<p>Nevertheless it is possible for a man, in his first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by contempt, both on account of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and on account of the many previous dispositions, or again, through being vehemently moved to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while but feebly attached to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence never or scarcely ever does it happen that the perfect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> all at once against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Peri Archon. i, 3): "I do not think that anyone who stands on the highest step of perfection, can fail or fall suddenly; this can only happen by degrees and bit by bit."

<p>The same applies, if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be taken literally for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> speaks of, always proceeds from contemptuous <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.

<p>If, however, with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi) we understand the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to denote final impenitence, it does not regard the question in point, because this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> requires persistence in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until the end of life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Movement both in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is made, for the most part, from imperfect to perfect, according as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> progresses in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and yet in both cases, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can begin from a greater (<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>) than another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does. Consequently, that from which a man begins can be perfect in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to its genus, although it may be imperfect as regards the series of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil actions</a> whereby a man progresses in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is committed through certain <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, when it proceeds from the inclination of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> If by impenitence we understand with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi) persistence in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> until the end, it is clear that it presupposes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as repentance does. If, however, we take it for <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> impenitence, in which sense it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it is evident that it can precede <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is possible for a man who has never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> to have the purpose either of repenting or of not repenting, if he should happen to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
