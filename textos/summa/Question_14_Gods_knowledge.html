<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is knowledge [Scientia]?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is the mean between <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> and act. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, since science is about conclusions, it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by something else which is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles. But nothing is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore science is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is universal, or particular. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no universal or particular (3, 5). Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says, "O the depth of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of the wisdom and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans 11:33</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> the most perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> this, we must note that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> beings are distinguished from non-<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> beings in that the latter possess only their own form; whereas the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> adapted to have also the form of some other thing; for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower. Hence it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a non-<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> being is more contracted and limited; whereas the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> beings has a greater amplitude and extension; therefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in a sense all things." Now the contraction of the form comes from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence, as we have said above (Question 7, Article 1) forms according as they are the more immaterial, approach more nearly to a kind of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore it is clear that the immateriality of a thing is the reason why it is cognitive; and according to the mode of immateriality is the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence it is said in De Anima ii that plants do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because they are wholly material. But sense is cognitive because it can receive images free from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is still further cognitive, because it is more separated from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and unmixed, as said in De Anima iii. Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the highest degree of immateriality as stated above (Question 7, Article 1), it follows that He occupies the highest place in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because perfections flowing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to creatures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a higher state in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself (4, 2), whenever a name taken from any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> perfection is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must be separated in its signification from anything that belongs to that imperfect mode proper to creatures. Hence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; but <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Whatever is divided and multiplied in creatures <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply and unitedly (13, 4). Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has different kinds of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the different objects of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He has "<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>" as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles; he has "science" as regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions; he has "wisdom," according as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; he has "counsel" or "<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>," according as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is to be done. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all these by one simple act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as will be shown (7). Hence the simple <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be named by all these names; in such a way, however, that there must be removed from each of them, so far as they enter into divine predication, everything that savors of imperfection; and everything that expresses perfection is to be retained in them. Hence it is said, "With Him is wisdom and strength, He hath counsel and understanding" (<a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse13">Job 12:13</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> is according to the mode of the one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; for the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower according to the mode of the knower. Now since the mode of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is higher than that of creatures, divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after the mode of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so as to be universal or particular, or <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> according to any such mode.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether God understands Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not understand Himself. For it is said by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Causis), "Every knower who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, returns completely to his own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not go out from His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor is He moved at all; thus He cannot return to His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to understand is a kind of passion and movement, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii); and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also is a kind of assimilation to the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is the perfection of the knower. But nothing is moved, or suffers, or is made perfect by itself, "nor," as <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. ii.), "is a thing its own likeness." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not understand Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, we are like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chiefly in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because we are the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. vi). But our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands itself, only as it understands other things, as is said in De Anima iii. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands Himself only so far perchance as He understands other things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "The things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands Himself through Himself. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof it must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that although in operations which pass to an external effect, the object of the operation, which is taken as the term, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> outside the operator; nevertheless in operations that remain in the operator, the object signified as the term of operation, resides in the operator; and accordingly as it is in the operator, the operation is actual. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii) that "the sensible in act is sense in act, and the intelligible in act is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act." For the reason why we actually feel or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing is because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or sense is actually informed by the sensible or intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. And because of this only, it follows that sense or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is distinct from the sensible or intelligible object, since both are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>.

<p>Since therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has nothing in Him of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>, His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its object are altogether the same; so that He neither is without the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as is the case with our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when it understands <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; nor does the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as it differs in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when it understands actually; but the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> itself is the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands Himself through Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Return to its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> means only that a thing subsists in itself. Inasmuch as the form perfects the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by giving it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, it is in a certain way diffused in it; and it returns to itself inasmuch as it has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in itself. Therefore those cognitive faculties which are not subsisting, but are the acts of organs, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves, as in the case of each of the senses; whereas those cognitive faculties which are subsisting, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves; hence it is said in De Causis that, "whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> returns to it." Now it supremely belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be self-subsisting. Hence according to this mode of speaking, He supremely returns to His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Movement and passion are taken equivocally, according as to understand is described as a kind of movement or passion, as stated in De Anima iii. For to understand is not a movement that is an act of something imperfect passing from one to another, but it is an act, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the agent itself, of something perfect. Likewise that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is perfected by the intelligible object, i.e. is assimilated to it, this belongs to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; because the fact of its being in a state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> makes it differ from the intelligible object and assimilates it thereto through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is the likeness of the thing understood, and makes it to be perfected thereby, as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is perfected by act. On the other hand, the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is no way in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, is not perfected by the intelligible object, nor is it assimilated thereto, but is its own perfection, and its own intelligible object.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Existence</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not belong to primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, unless it is reduced to act by a form. Now our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has the same relation to intelligible objects as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things; for it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> as regards intelligible objects, just as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things. Hence our passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can be exercised concerning intelligible objects only so far as it is perfected by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of something; and in that way it understands itself by an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as it understands other things: for it is manifest that by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the intelligible object it understands also its own act of understanding, and by this act <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculty. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a> in the order of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as also in the order of intelligible objects; therefore He understands Himself through Himself.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether God comprehends Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not comprehend Himself. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. xv), that "whatever comprehends itself is finite as regards itself." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in all ways <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Therefore He does not comprehend Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> If it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> to us, and finite to Himself, it can be urged to the contrary, that everything in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is truer than it is in us. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is finite to Himself, but <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> to us, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> finite than <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; which is against what was laid down above (Question 7, Article 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not comprehend Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. xv), that "Everything that understands itself, comprehends itself." But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands Himself. Therefore He comprehends Himself.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perfectly comprehends Himself, as can be thus <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. A thing is said to be comprehended when the end of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it is attained, and this is accomplished when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as perfectly as it is knowable; as, for instance, a demonstrable proposition is comprehended when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by demonstration, not, however, when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by some probable reason. Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself as perfectly as He is perfectly knowable. For everything is knowable according to the mode of its own <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>; since a thing is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according as it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but in so far as it is in <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a>, as said in Metaph. ix. Now the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is as great as His <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">actuality</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>; because it is from the fact that He is in act and free from all <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is cognitive, as shown above (Question 1, Article 2). Whence it is manifest that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself as much as He is knowable; and for that reason He perfectly comprehends Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The strict meaning of "comprehension" signifies that one thing holds and includes another; and in this sense everything comprehended is finite, as also is everything included in another. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not said to be comprehended by Himself in this sense, as if His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were a faculty apart from Himself, and as if it held and included Himself; for these modes of speaking are to be taken by way of negation. But as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be in Himself, forasmuch as He is not contained by anything outside of Himself; so He is said to be comprehended by Himself, forasmuch as nothing in Himself is hidden from Himself. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vid. Deum. ep. cxii), "The whole is comprehended when seen, if it is seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When it is said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is finite to Himself," this is to be understood according to a certain similitude of proportion, because He has the same relation in not exceeding His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as anything finite has in not exceeding finite <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not to be called finite to Himself in this sense, as if He understood Himself to be something finite.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the act of God's intellect is His substance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For to understand is an operation. But an operation signifies something proceeding from the operator. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to understand one's act of understanding, is to understand something that is neither great nor chiefly understood, and but secondary and accessory. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be his own act of understanding, His act of understanding will be as when we understand our act of understanding: and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act of understanding will not be something great.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every act of understanding means understanding something. When therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands Himself, if He Himself is not distinct from this act of understanding, He understands that He understands Himself; and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. vii), "In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be is the same as to be wise." But to be wise is the same thing as to understand. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be is the same thing as to understand. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as shown above (Question 3, Article 4). Therefore the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must be said that the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. For if His act of understanding were other than His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, then something else, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. xii), would be the act and perfection of the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, to which the divine <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> would be related, as <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> is to act, which is altogether impossible; because the act of understanding is the perfection and act of the one understanding. Let us now consider how this is. As was laid down above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), to understand is not an act passing to anything extrinsic; for it remains in the operator as his own act and perfection; as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is the perfection of the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> follows on the form, so in like manner to understand follows on the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no form which is something other than His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as shown above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Hence as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself is also His intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows that His act of understanding must be His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Thus it follows from all the foregoing that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the object understood, and the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and His act of understanding are entirely one and the same. Hence when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be understanding, no kind of multiplicity is attached to His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To understand is not an operation proceeding out of the operator, but remaining in him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When that act of understanding which is not subsistent is understood, something not great is understood; as when we understand our act of understanding; and so this cannot be likened to the act of the divine understanding which is subsistent.

<p>Thus appears the Reply to the Third Objection. For the act of divine understanding subsists in itself, and belongs to its very self and is not another's; hence it need not proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God knows things other than Himself?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things besides Himself. For all other things but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are outside of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not behold anything out of Himself." Therefore He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things other than Himself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the object understood is the perfection of the one who understands. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands other things besides Himself, something else will be the perfection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will be nobler than He; which is impossible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the act of understanding is specified by the intelligible object, as is every other act from its own object. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act is so much the nobler, the nobler the object understood. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act. If therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands anything other than Himself, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is specified by something else than Himself; which cannot be. Therefore He does not understand things other than Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "All things are naked and open to His eyes" (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse13">Hebrews 4:13</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself. For it is manifest that He perfectly understands Himself; otherwise His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> would not be perfect, since His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is His act of understanding. Now if anything is perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that its power is perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But the power of anything can be perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> to what its power extends. Since therefore the divine power extends to other things by the very fact that it is the first effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, as is clear from the aforesaid (2, 3), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things other than Himself. And this appears still more plainly if we add that the every <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the first effective <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>--viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--is His own act of understanding. Hence whatever effects pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, must be in His act of understanding, and all things must be in Him according to an intelligible mode: for everything which is in another, is in it according to the mode of that in which it is.

<p>Now in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself, we must consider that a thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in two ways: in itself, and in another. A thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> adequate to the knowable object; as when the eye sees a man through the image of a man. A thing is seen in another through the image of that which contains it; as when a part is seen in the whole by the image of the whole; or when a man is seen in a mirror by the image in the mirror, or by any other mode by which one thing is seen in another.

<p>So we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees Himself in Himself, because He sees Himself through His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and He sees other things not in themselves, but in Himself; inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> contains the similitude of things other than Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in which it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "sees nothing outside Himself" is not to be taken in such a way, as if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw nothing outside Himself, but in the sense that what is outside Himself He does not see except in Himself, as above explained.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The object understood is a perfection of the one understanding not by its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but by its image, according to which it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and perfection, as is said in De Anima iii. For "a stone is not in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but its image." Now those things which are other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are understood by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contains their images as above explained; hence it does not follow that there is any perfection in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> other than the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act is not specified by what is understood in another, but by the principal object understood in which other things are understood. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act is specified by its object, inasmuch as the intelligible form is the principle of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation: since every operation is specified by the form which is its principle of operation; as heating by heat. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation is specified by that intelligible form which makes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act. And this is the image of the principal thing understood, which in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is nothing but His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in which all images of things are comprehended. Hence it does not follow that the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act, or rather <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, is specified by anything else than the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether God knows things other than Himself by proper knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things other than Himself by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For, as was shown (5), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself, according as they are in Himself. But other things are in Him as in their common and universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in their first and universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. This is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by general, and not by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things besides Himself by general, and not by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is as distant from the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is distant from the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as said above (12/2). Therefore neither can the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Thus as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it follows that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the creature is in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "what it is," which is to have proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a thing can come only through its proper ratio. But as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it seems that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each thing by its proper ratio; for one thing cannot be the proper ratio of many and diverse things. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, but a general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things otherwise than by their proper ratio is to have only a common and general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To have a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them not only in general, but as they are distinct from each other. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things in that manner. Hence it is written that He reaches "even to the division of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart; neither is there any creature invisible in His sight" (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> on this point, saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself only in general, that is, only as beings. For as fire, if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of heat, and all things else in so far as they are hot; so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Himself as the principle of being, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being, and all other things in so far as they are beings.

<p>But this cannot be. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing in general and not in particular, is to have an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when it is reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, acquires first a universal and confused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, before it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them in particular; as proceeding from the imperfect to the perfect, as is clear from Phys. i. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regarding things other than Himself is only universal and not special, it would follow that His understanding would not be absolutely perfect; therefore neither would His being be perfect; and this is against what was said above (Question 4, Article 1). We must therefore hold that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself with a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; not only in so far as being is common to them, but in so far as one is distinguished from the other. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> thereof we may observe that some wishing to show that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things by one, bring forward some examples, as, for instance, that if the centre <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> itself, it would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all lines that proceed from the centre; or if light <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> itself, it would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all colors.

<p>Now these examples although they are similar in part, namely, as regards universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, nevertheless they fail in this respect, that multitude and diversity are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the one universal principle, not as regards that which is the principle of distinction, but only as regards that in which they communicate. For the diversity of colors is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the light only, but by the different disposition of the diaphanous medium which receives it; and likewise, the diversity of the lines is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by their different position. Hence it is that this kind of diversity and multitude cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its principle by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but only in a general way. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, it is otherwise. For it was shown above (Question 4, Article 2) that whatever perfection <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in any creature, wholly pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> and is contained in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an excelling manner. Now not only what is common to creatures--viz. being--belongs to their perfection, but also what makes them distinguished from each other; as living and understanding, and the like, whereby living beings are distinguished from the non-living, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a> from the non-<a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligent</a>. Likewise every form whereby each thing is constituted in its own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, is a perfection; and thus all things pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only as regards what is common to all, but also as regards what distinguishes one thing from another. And therefore as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contains all perfections in Himself, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is compared to all other <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of things, not as the common to the proper, as unity is to numbers, or as the centre (of a circle) to the (radiating) lines; but as perfect acts to imperfect; as if I were to compare <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to animal; or six, a perfect number, to the imperfect numbers contained under it. Now it is manifest that by a perfect act imperfect acts can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only in general, but also by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; thus, for example, whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a man, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> an animal by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the number six, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the number three also by proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>As therefore the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contains in itself all the perfection contained in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of any other being, and far more, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in Himself all of them with proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proper to each thing consists in some degree of participation in the divine perfection. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could not be said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Himself perfectly unless He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the ways in which His own perfection can be shared by others. Neither could He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of being perfectly, unless He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all modes of being. Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things with proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in their distinction from each other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> So to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing as it is in the knower, may be understood in two ways. In one way this adverb "so" imports the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on the part of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and in that sense it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For the knower does not always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> it has in the knower; since the eye does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a stone according to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> it has in the eye; but by the image of the stone which is in the eye, the eye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the stone according to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> outside the eye. And if any knower has a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> according to the (mode of) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> it has in the knower, the knower nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it according to its (mode of) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> outside the knower; thus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a stone according to the intelligible <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> it has in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it understands; while nevertheless it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what a stone is in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If however the adverb 'so' be understood to import the mode (of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>) on the part of the knower, in that sense it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that only the knower has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as it is in the knower; for the more perfectly the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower, the more perfect is the mode of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>We must say therefore that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that all things are in Himself; but by the fact that they are in Him, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and all the more perfectly, the more perfectly each one is in Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is compared to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the imperfect to the perfect act. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot sufficiently lead us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but rather the converse.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The same thing cannot be taken in an equal manner as the ratio of different things. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> excels all creatures. Hence it can be taken as the proper ration of each thing according to the diverse ways in which diverse creatures participate in, and imitate it.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the knowledge of God is discursive?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is discursive. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. ii): "The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may regard many things at once; but actual understanding regards only one thing at a time." Therefore as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> many things, Himself and others, as shown above (2,5), it seems that He does not understand all at once, but discourses from one to another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, discursive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the effect through its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things through Himself; as an effect (is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>) through its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is discursive.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> each creature more perfectly than we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the effects in their <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and thus we go discursively from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to things <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>. Therefore it seems that the same applies to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not see all things in their particularity or separately, as if He saw alternately here and there; but He sees all things together at once."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there is no discursion; the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which is as follows. In our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there is a twofold discursion: one is according to succession only, as when we have actually understood anything, we turn ourselves to understand something else; while the other mode of discursion is according to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as when through principles we arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conclusions. The first kind of discursion cannot belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For many things, which we understand in succession if each is considered in itself, we understand simultaneously if we see them in some one thing; if, for instance, we understand the parts in the whole, or see different things in a mirror. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things in one (thing), which is Himself. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees all things together, and not successively. Likewise the second mode of discursion cannot be applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>First, because this second mode of discursion presupposes the first mode; for whosoever proceeds from principles to conclusions does not consider both at once; secondly, because to discourse thus is to proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the unknown. Hence it is manifest that when the first is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the second is still unknown; and thus the second is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not in the first, but from the first. Now the term discursive reasoning is attained when the second is seen in the first, by resolving the effects into their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; and then the discursion ceases. Hence as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees His effects in Himself as their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not discursive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Altogether there is only one act of understanding in itself, nevertheless many things may be understood in one (medium), as shown above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as it were previously, effects unknown; but He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the effects in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and hence His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not discursive, as was shown above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees the effects of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> themselves, much better than we can; but still not in such a manner that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the effects is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in Him by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as is the case with us; and hence His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not discursive.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the knowledge of God is the cause of things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. For <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says, on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans 8:30</a>, "Whom He called, them He also justified," etc.: "A thing will happen not because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it as future; but because it is future, it is on that account <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, given the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the effect follows. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, it seems that creatures are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "The thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is prior to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and is its measure," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. x). But what is posterior and measured cannot be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv), "Not because they are, does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all creatures <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and temporal, but because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them, therefore they are."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to all creatures what the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the artificer is to things made by his art. Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the artificer is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the things made by his art from the fact that the artificer works by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence the form of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> must be the principle of action; as heat is the principle of heating. Nevertheless, we must observe that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, being a form that remains in that to which it gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, denotes a principle of action according only as it has an inclination to an effect; and likewise, the intelligible form does not denote a principle of action in so far as it resides in the one who understands unless there is added to it the inclination to an effect, which inclination is through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For since the intelligible form has a relation to opposite things (inasmuch as the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> relates to opposites), it would not produce a determinate effect unless it were determined to one thing by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. ix). Now it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> things by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since His being is His act of understanding; and hence His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, in so far as His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is joined to it. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things is usually called the "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of approbation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> spoke in reference to that aspect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> does not belong unless the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is joined to it, as is said above.

<p>But when he says the reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows some things is because they are future, this must be understood according to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of consequence, and not according to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For if things are in the future, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them; but not that the futurity of things is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things according as things are in His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now that things should be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> was not in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence although the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, it does not follow that creatures are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Natural things are midway between the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for we receive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are prior to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and are its measure, so, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is prior to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, and is the measure of them; as, for instance, a house is midway between the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the builder who made it, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the one who gathers his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the house from the house already built.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether God has knowledge of things that are not?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things that are not. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things. But "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" and "being" are convertible terms. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not of things that are not.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requires likeness between the knower and the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But those things that are not cannot have any likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is very being. Therefore what is not, cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him. But it is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things that are not, because a thing that is not, has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things that are not.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says: "Who . . . calleth those things that are not as those that are" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse17">Romans 4:17</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things whatsoever that in any way are. Now it is possible that things that are not absolutely, should be in a certain sense. For things absolutely are which are actual; whereas things which are not actual, are in the power either of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself or of a creature, whether in active power, or passive; whether in power of thought or of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or of any other manner of meaning whatsoever. Whatever therefore can be made, or thought, or said by the creature, as also whatever He Himself can do, all are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they are not actual. And in so far it can be said that He has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even of things that are not.

<p>Now a certain difference is to be noted in the consideration of those things that are not actual. For though some of them may not be in act now, still they were, or they will be; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all these with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision: for since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act of understanding, which is His being, is measured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and since <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is without succession, comprehending all time, the present glance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> extends over all time, and to all things which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in any time, as to objects present to Him. But there are other things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, or the creature's, which nevertheless are not, nor will be, nor were; and as regards these He is said to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not of vision, but of simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. This is so called because the things we see around us have distinct being outside the seer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Those things that are not actual are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as they are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they are in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>; and as such they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is very being everything is, in so far as it participates in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as everything is hot in so far as it participates in heat. So, things in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they are not in act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, joined to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things. Hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that what ever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is, or was, or will be; but only is this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as regards what He wills to be, or permits to be. Further, it is in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not that they be, but that they be possible.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether God knows evil things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

Therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is never in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, but is always in act, as is clear from the foregoing (2), it seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is either the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, or is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by it. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor is it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> either by its likeness, or by its opposite. But whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> through His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as is clear from the foregoing (5). Now the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> neither is the likeness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> contrary to it; for to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> there is no contrary, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another and not through itself, is imperfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> must be in the knower. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through another, namely, through <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it would be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him imperfectly; which cannot be, for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not imperfect.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a thing perfectly, must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that can be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to it. Now there are some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to which corruption by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>.

Now a thing is knowable in the degree in which it is; hence since this is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that it is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, by the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things also; as by light is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> darkness. Hence <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Himself receives the vision of darkness, not otherwise seeing darkness except through light."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> must be understood as meaning that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is not in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> privation by privation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in it; and this agrees with what he said previously, that a point and every indivisible thing are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by privation of division. This is because simple and indivisible forms are in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> not actually, but only <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>; for were they actually in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, they would not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by privation. It is thus that simple things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by separate <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not by privation <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in Himself, but by the opposite <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not opposed to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which is not corruptible by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; it is opposed to the effects of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether God knows singular things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things. For the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is more immaterial than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by reason of its immateriality does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things; but as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima ii), "reason has to do with universals, sense with singular things." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in us those faculties alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular, which receive the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> not abstracted from material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> things are in the highest degree abstracted from all materiality. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes about through the medium of some likeness. But the likeness of singular things in so far as they are singular, does not seem to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the principle of singularity is <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which, since it is in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> only, is altogether unlike <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">pure act</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse2">Proverbs 16:2</a>), "All the ways of a man are open to His eyes."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singular things. For all perfections found in creatures pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a higher way, as is clear from the foregoing (4, 2). Now to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things is part of our perfection. Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things. Even the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> considers it incongruous that anything <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us should be unknown to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus against Empedocles he argues (De Anima i and Metaph. iii) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> if He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> discord. Now the perfections which are divided among inferior beings, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> simply and unitedly in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence, although by one faculty we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the universal and immaterial, and by another we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular and material things, nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both by His simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>Now some, wishing to show how this can be, said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singular things by universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For nothing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in any singular thing, that does not arise from some universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. They give the example of an <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all the universal movements of the heavens, and can thence foretell all eclipses that are to come. This, however, is not enough; for singular things from universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> attain to certain forms and powers which, however they may be joined together, are not individualized except by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Hence he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> because he is white, or because he is the son of Sophroniscus, or because of something of that kind, would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him in so far as he is this particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence according to the aforesaid mode, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> singular things in their singularity.

<p>On the other hand, others have said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> singular things by the application of universal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to particular effects. But this will not hold; forasmuch as no one can apply a thing to another unless he first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that thing; hence the said application cannot be the reason of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the particular, for it presupposes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of singular things.

<p>Therefore it must be said otherwise, that, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things by His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>), His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends as far as His <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> extends. Hence as the active power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> extends not only to forms, which are the source of universality, but also to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as we shall <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> further on (44, 2), the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must extend to singular things, which are individualized by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. For since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things other than Himself by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as being the likeness of things, or as their active principle, His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> must be the sufficing principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things made by Him, not only in the universal, but also in the singular. The same would apply to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the artificer, if it were productive of the whole thing, and not only of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individualizing</a> principles; hence the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> principles; and on that account our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the singular. But the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is immaterial not by <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstraction</a>, but of itself, being the principle of all the principles which enter into the composition of things, whether principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> or principles of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; hence by it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not only universal, but also singular things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although as regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> its being has no material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> like the images received in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and sense, yet its power extends to both immaterial and material things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as regards its <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> recedes from likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet, even in so far as it has being in this wise, it retains a certain likeness to the divine being.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether God can know infinite things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things. For the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as such, is unknown; since the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is that which, "to those who measure it, leaves always something more to be measured," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iii). Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii) that "whatever is comprehended by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is bounded by the comprehension of the knower." Now <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things have no boundary. Therefore they cannot be comprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if we say that things <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in themselves are finite in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, against this it may be urged that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is that it is untraversable, and the finite that it is traversable, as said in Phys. iii. But the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not traversable either by the finite or by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Phys. vi. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be bounded by the finite, nor even by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; and so the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be finite in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the measure of what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> that it be measured. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii), "Although we cannot number the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, nevertheless it can be comprehended by Him whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has no bounds."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not only things actual but also things possible to Himself or to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, as shown above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), and as these must be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it must be held that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things. Although the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision which has relation only to things that are, or will be, or were, is not of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things, as some say, for we do not say that the world is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, nor that generation and movement will go on for ever, so that <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> multiplied; yet, if we consider more attentively, we must hold that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things even by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> even the thoughts and affections of hearts, which will be multiplied to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> as rational creatures go on for ever.

<p>The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of every knower is measured by the mode of the form which is the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the sensible image in sense is the likeness of only one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> thing, and can give the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of only one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>. But the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the likeness of the thing as regards its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is participable by <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> particulars; hence our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in a certain way <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> men; not however as distinguished from each other, but as communicating in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and the reason is because the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not as to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> principles, but as to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. On the other hand, the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, whereby the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, is a sufficing likeness of all things that are, or can be, not only as regards the universal principles, but also as regards the principles proper to each one, as shown above. Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> extends to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things, even as distinct from each other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. i). But the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> implies the order of parts. Therefore to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> according to the mode of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> part after part; and in this way the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for whatever <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> of parts be taken, there will always remain something else outside. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things, as if He enumerated part after part; since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things simultaneously, and not successively, as said above (<a href="#7">Article 7</a>). Hence there is nothing to prevent Him from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Transition imports a certain succession of parts; and hence it is that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot be traversed by the finite, nor by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But equality suffices for comprehension, because that is said to be comprehended which has nothing outside the comprehender. Hence it is not against the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> to be comprehended by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. And so, what is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in itself can be called finite to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as comprehended; but not as if it were traversable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the measure of things, not quantitatively, for the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is not subject to this kind of measure; but it is the measure of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things. For everything has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> according to the degree in which it imitates the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the thing made by art agrees with the art. Granted, however, an actually <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of things, for instance, an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> in continuous <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, as an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitude</a> of air, as some of the ancients held; yet it is manifest that these would have a determinate and finite being, because their being would be limited to some determinate <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence they would be measurable as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article13">Article 13. Whether the knowledge of God is of future contingent things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not of future contingent things. For from a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> proceeds a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> effect. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as said above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). Since therefore that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> must also be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not of contingent things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every conditional proposition of which the antecedent is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> must have an absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequent. For the antecedent is to the consequent as principles are to the conclusion: and from <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> principles only a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusion can follow, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in Poster. i. But this is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conditional proposition, "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this thing will be, it will be," for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is only of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things. Now the antecedent conditional of this is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, because it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and because it is signified as past. Therefore the consequent is also absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not of contingent things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, everything <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be, because even what we ourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be; and, of course, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is much more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> than ours. But no future contingent things must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be. Therefore no contingent future thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse15">Psalm 32:15</a>), "He Who hath made the hearts of every one of them; Who understandeth all their works," i.e. of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, being subject to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> future contingent things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since as was shown above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things; not only things actual but also things possible to Him and creature; and since some of these are future contingent to us, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> future contingent things.

<p>In evidence of this, we must consider that a contingent thing can be considered in two ways; first, in itself, in so far as it is now in act: and in this sense it is not considered as future, but as present; neither is it considered as contingent (as having reference) to one of two terms, but as determined to one; and on account of this it can be infallibly the object of certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for instance to the sense of sight, as when I see that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is sitting down. In another way a contingent thing can be considered as it is in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and in this way it is considered as future, and as a contingent thing not yet determined to one; forasmuch as a contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has relation to opposite things: and in this sense a contingent thing is not subject to any certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence, whoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a contingent effect in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only, has merely a conjectural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all contingent things not only as they are in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, but also as each one of them is actually in itself. And although contingent things become actual successively, nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> contingent things not successively, as they are in their own being, as we do but simultaneously. The reason is because His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is measured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, as is also His being; and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> being simultaneously whole comprises all time, as said above (Question 10, Article 2). Hence all things that are in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are present to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, not only because He has the types of things present within Him, as some say; but because His glance is carried from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> over all things as they are in their presentiality. Hence it is manifest that contingent things are infallibly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as they are subject to the divine sight in their presentiality; yet they are future contingent things in relation to their own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the supreme <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the effect may be contingent by reason of the proximate contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; just as the germination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate contingent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, although the movement of the sun which is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. So likewise things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are contingent on account of their proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some say that this antecedent, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this contingent to be future," is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>; because, although it is past, still it imports relation to the future. This however does not remove <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> from it; for whatever has had relation to the future, must have had it, although the future sometimes does not follow. On the other hand some say that this antecedent is <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, because it is a compound of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>; as this saying is <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is a white <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But this also is to no purpose; for when we say, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this contingent to be future," contingent is used here only as the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of the word, and not as the chief part of the proposition. Hence its contingency or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> has no reference to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or contingency of the proposition, or to its being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For it may be just as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that I said a man is an ass, as that I said <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> runs, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is: and the same applies to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>. Hence it must be said that this antecedent is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Nor does it follow, as some say, that the consequent is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, because the antecedent is the remote <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the consequent, which is contingent by reason of the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But this is to no purpose. For the conditional would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> were its antecedent the remote <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the consequent a contingent effect; as, for example, if I said, "if the sun moves, the grass will grow."

<p>Therefore we must reply otherwise; that when the antecedent contains anything belonging to an act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the consequent must be taken not as it is in itself, but as it is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing in itself is different from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For example, when I say, "What the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> understands is immaterial," this is to be understood that it is immaterial as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not as it is in itself. Likewise if I say, "If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> anything, it will be," the consequent must be understood as it is subject to the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. as it is in its presentiality. And thus it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as also is the antecedent: "For everything that is, while it is, must be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in Peri Herm. i.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things reduced to act in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us successively in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>) in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, which is above time. Whence to us they cannot be certain, forasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> future contingent things as such; but (they are certain) to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, whose understanding is in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> above time. Just as he who goes along the road, does not see those who come after him; whereas he who sees the whole road from a height, sees at once all travelling by the way. Hence what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us must be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, even as it is in itself; for what is future contingent in itself, cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us. Whereas what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> according to the mode in which they are subject to the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as already stated, but not absolutely as considered in their own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Hence also this proposition, "Everything <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be," is usually distinguished; for this may refer to the thing, or to the saying. If it refers to the thing, it is divided and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; for the sense is, "Everything which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>." If understood of the saying, it is composite and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for the sense is, "This proposition, 'that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is' is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>."

<p>Now some urge an objection and say that this distinction holds good with regard to forms that are separable from the subject; thus if I said, "It is possible for a white thing to be black," it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as applied to the saying, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as applied to the thing: for a thing which is white, can become black; whereas this saying, " a white thing is black" can never be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But in forms that are inseparable from the subject, this distinction does not hold, for instance, if I said, "A black crow can be white"; for in both senses it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Now to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is inseparable from the thing; for what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. This objection, however, would hold if these words "that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>" implied any disposition inherent to the subject; but since they import an act of the knower, something can be attributed to the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, in itself (even if it always be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>), which is not attributed to it in so far as it stands under actual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; thus material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is attributed to a stone in itself, which is not attributed to it inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<h2 id="article14">Article 14. Whether God knows enunciable things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enunciable things. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enunciable things belongs to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as it composes and divides. But in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, there is no composition. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enunciable things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is made through some likeness. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no likeness of enunciable things, since He is altogether simple. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enunciable things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written: "The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa093.htm#verse11">Psalm 93:11</a>). But enunciable things are contained in the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> enunciable things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since it is in the power of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to form enunciations, and since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whatever is in His own power or in that of creatures, as said above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), it follows of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all enunciations that can be formed.

<p>Now just as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> material things immaterially, and composite things simply, so likewise He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> enunciable things not after the manner of enunciable things, as if in His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there were composition or division of enunciations; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> each thing by simple <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, by understanding the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of each thing; as if we by the very fact that we understand what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, were to understand all that can be predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. This, however, does not happen in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which discourses from one thing to another, forasmuch as the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> represents one thing in such a way as not to represent another. Hence when we understand what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, we do not forthwith understand other things which belong to him, but we understand them one by one, according to a certain succession. On this account the things we understand as separated, we must reduce to one by way of composition or division, by forming an enunciation. Now the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, suffices to represent all things. Hence by understanding His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of all things, and also whatever can be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This objection would avail if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> enunciable things after the manner of enunciable things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Enunciatory composition signifies some <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a thing; and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, which is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is the similitude of all those things which are signified by enunciation.

<h2 id="article15">Article 15. Whether the knowledge of God is variable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is variable. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is related to what is knowable. But whatever imports relation to the creature is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from time, and varies according to the variation of creatures. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is variable according to the variation of creatures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make, He can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make more than He does. Therefore He can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more than He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Thus His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can vary according to increase and diminution.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knew that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be born. But He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will be born; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not to be born in the future. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything He once knew; and thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is variable.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said, that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "there is no change nor shadow of alteration" (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James 1:17</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as is clear from the foregoing (4), just as His <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is altogether immutable, as shown above (Question 9, Article 1), so His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> likewise must be altogether invariable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> "Lord", "Creator" and the like, import relations to creatures in so far as they are in themselves. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imports relation to creatures in so far as they are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because everything is actually understood according as it is in the one who understands. Now <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an invariable manner; while they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> variably in themselves. We may also say that "Lord", "Creator" and the like, import the relations consequent upon the acts which are understood as terminating in the creatures themselves, as they are in themselves; and thus these relations are attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> variously, according to the variation of creatures. But "knowledge" and "love," and the like, import relations consequent upon the acts which are understood to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore these are predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in an invariable manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also what He can make, and does not make. Hence from the fact that He can make more than He makes, it does not follow that He can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more than He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, unless this be referred to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of vision, according to which He is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which are in act in some period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But from the fact that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> some things might be which are not, or that some things might not be which are, it does not follow that His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is variable, but rather that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the variability of things. If, however, anything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, then His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> would be variable. But this could not be; for whatever is, or can be in any period of time, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore from the fact that a thing <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in some period of time, it follows that it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore it cannot be granted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more than He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; because such a proposition implies that first of all He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and then afterwards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The ancient <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> said that it was the same thing to say "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is born" and "will be born" and "was born"; because the same thing is signified by these three--viz. the nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it follows, they said, that whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; because now He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is born, which means the same thing as that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will be born. This opinion, however, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; both because the diversity in the parts of a sentence <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a diversity of enunciations; and because it would follow that a proposition which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> once would be always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; which is contrary to what the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> lays down (Categor. iii) when he says that this sentence, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when he is sitting, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> when he rises up. Therefore, it must be conceded that this proposition is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "Whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>," if referred to enunciable propositions. But because of this, it does not follow that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is variable. For as it is without variation in the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> one and the same thing sometime to be, and sometime not to be, so it is without variation in the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> an enunciable proposition is sometime <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and sometime <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, would be variable if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> enunciable things by way of enunciation, by composition and division, as occurs in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> varies either as regards <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>, for example, if when either as regards <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>, for example, if when a thing suffers change we retained the same opinion about it; or as regards diverse opinions, as if we first thought that anyone was sitting, and afterwards thought that he was not sitting; neither of which can be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article16">Article 16. Whether God has a speculative knowledge of things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not a speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, as shown above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). But speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not speculative.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes by abstraction from things; which does not belong to the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not speculative.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is the more excellent must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more excellent than practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the beginning of Metaphysics. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is speculative only; some is practical only; and some is partly speculative and partly practical. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> whereof it must be observed that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be called speculative in three ways: first, on the part of the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which are not operable by the knower; such is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> about <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or divine thing.

<p>Secondly, as regards the manner of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>--as, for instance, if a builder consider a house by defining and dividing, and considering what belongs to it in general: for this is to consider operable things in a speculative manner, and not as practically operable; for operable means the application of form to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and not the resolution of the composite into its universal formal principles.

<p>Thirdly, as regards the end; "for the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> differs in its end from the speculative," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii). For the practical <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is ordered to the end of the operation; whereas the end of the speculative <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the consideration of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence if a builder should consider how a house can be made, not ordering this to the end of operation, but only to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> (how to do it), this would be only a speculative considerations as regards the end, although it concerns an operable thing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is speculative by reason of the thing itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is merely speculative. But that which is speculative either in its mode or as to its end is partly speculative and partly practical: and when it is ordained to an operative end it is simply practical.

<p>In accordance with this, therefore, it must be said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has of Himself a speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> only; for He Himself is not operable. But of all other things He has both speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He has speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as regards the mode; for whatever we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> speculatively in things by defining and dividing, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all this much more perfectly.

<p>Now of things which He can make, but does not make at any time, He has not a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is called practical from the end. But He has a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what He makes in some period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. And, as regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, although they are not operable by Him, yet they fall under His practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, like <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, inasmuch as He permits, or impedes, or directs them; as also sicknesses fall under the practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the physician, inasmuch as he cures them by his art.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, not indeed of Himself, but of other things. He is actually the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of some, that is, of things that come to be in some period of time; and He is virtually the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of others, that is, of things which He can make, and which nevertheless are never made.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is derived from things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> belong to speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.

<p>In answer to what is objected on the contrary, we must say that perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of operable things is obtainable only if they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in so far as they are operable. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in every way perfect, He must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is operable by Him, formally as such, and not only in so far as they are speculative. Nevertheless this does not impair the nobility of His speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, forasmuch as He sees all things other than Himself in Himself, and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself speculatively; and so in the speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, he possesses both speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all other things.
