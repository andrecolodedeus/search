<h1>Question 14. The defects of body assumed by the Son of God</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4014.htm#article1"> Should the Son of God have assumed in human nature defects of body?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4014.htm#article2"> Did he assume the obligation of being subject to these defects?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4014.htm#article3"> Did He contract these defects?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4014.htm#article4"> Did he assume all these defects?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the Son of God in human nature ought to have assumed defects of body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought not to have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with defects of body. For as His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is personally united to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, so also is His body. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had every perfection, both of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as was said above (7, 9; 9, seqq.). Hence, His body also ought to have been in every way perfect, not having any imperfection in it.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> saw the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> by the vision wherein the blessed see, as was said above (Question 9, Article 2), and thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was blessed. Now by the beatification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the body is glorified; since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dios. cxviii), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> so strong that from the fulness of its blessedness there pours over even into the lower <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (i.e. the body), "not indeed the bliss proper to the beatific fruition and vision, but the fulness of health" (i.e. the vigor of incorruptibility). Therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was incorruptible and without any defect.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, penalty is the consequence of fault. But there was no fault in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a>: "Who did no guile." Therefore defects of body, which are penalties, ought not to have been in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no reasonable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> assumes what keeps him from his proper end. But by such like bodily defects, the end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> seems to be hindered in many ways. First, because by these infirmities men were kept back from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Him, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>: "[There was no sightliness] that we should be desirous of Him. Despised and the most abject of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity, and His look was, as it were, hidden and despised, whereupon we esteemed Him not." Secondly, because the de. sire of the Fathers would not seem to be fulfilled, in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse9">Isaiah 51:9</a>): "Arise, arise, put on Thy strength, O Thou Arm of the Lord." Thirdly, because it would seem more fitting for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power to be overcome and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weakness healed, by strength than by weakness. Therefore it does not seem to have been fitting that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with infirmities or defects of body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse18">Hebrews 2:18</a>): "For in that, wherein He Himself hath suffered and been tempted, He is able to succor them also that are tempted." Now He came to succor us. hence David said of Him (<a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse1">Psalm 120:1</a>): "I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me." Therefore it was fitting for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to assume flesh subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmities, in order to suffer and be tempted in it and so bring succor to us.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It was fitting for the body assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmities and defects; and especially for three reasons. First, because it was in order to satisfy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, having taken flesh, came into the world. Now one satisfies for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by taking on himself the punishment due to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the other. But these bodily defects, to wit, death, hunger, thirst, and the like, are the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which was brought into the world by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>: "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death." Hence it was useful for the end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> that He should assume these penalties in our flesh and in our stead, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>, "Surely He hath borne our infirmities." Secondly, in order to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. For since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> only as it is subject to these defects, if the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without these defects, He would not have seemed to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor to have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, flesh, as the Manicheans held. And so, as is said, <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>: "He . . . emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> found as a man." Hence, Thomas, by the sight of His wounds, was recalled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as related <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John 20:26</a>. Thirdly, in order to show us an example of patience by valiantly bearing up against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> passibility and defects. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse3">Hebrews 12:3</a>) that He "endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, that you be not wearied. fainting in your minds."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The penalties one suffers for another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as it were, of the satisfaction for that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the principle is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby one is inclined to wish to satisfy for another, and from which the satisfaction has its efficacy, for satisfaction would not be efficacious unless it proceeded from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as will be explained (XP, 14, 2). Hence, it behooved the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be perfect as regards the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in order to have the power of satisfying; but His body was subject to infirmities, that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of satisfaction should not be wanting.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> From the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relationship which is between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> flows into the body from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Yet this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> relationship in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Godhead, and thereby it came to pass that the beatitude remained in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and did not flow into the body; but the flesh suffered what belongs to a passible <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15) that, "it was by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was allowed to suffer and do what belonged to it."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Punishment always follows <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> actual or original, sometimes of the one punished, sometimes of the one for whom he who suffers the punishment satisfies. And so it was with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah 53:5</a>: "He was wounded for our iniquities, He was bruised for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The infirmity assumed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not impede, but greatly furthered the end of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, as above stated. And although these infirmities concealed His Godhead, they made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His Manhood, which is the way of coming to the Godhead, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans 5:1-2</a>: "By <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> we have access to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Moreover, the ancient Fathers did not desire bodily strength in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> strength, wherewith He vanquished the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and healed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether Christ was of necessity subject to these defects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> subject to these defects. For it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>): "He was offered because it was His own will"; and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is speaking of the offering of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> subject to bodily defects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 20): "Nothing obligatory is seen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: all is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>." Now what is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Therefore these defects were not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is induced by something more powerful. But no creature is more powerful than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to which it pertained to preserve its own body. Therefore these defects were not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" sent "His own Son in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh." Now it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh to be under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying, and suffering other like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of suffering these defects was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">Necessity</a> is twofold. one is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of "constraint," brought about by an external agent; and this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is contrary to both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and will, since these flow from an internal principle. The other is "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>" <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, resulting from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles--either the form (as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for fire to heat), or the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (as it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a body composed of contraries to be dissolved). Hence, with this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, which results from the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death and other like defects, since, as was said (1, ad 2), "it was by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was allowed to do and suffer what belonged to it." And this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> results from the principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was said above in this article. But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of constraint, as repugnant to the bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, thus again was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> in regard to the nail that pierced and the scourge that struck. Yet inasmuch as such <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> is repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, it is clear that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> these defects were not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> as regards either the Divine will, or the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> considered absolutely, as following the deliberation of reason; but only as regards the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, inasmuch as it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> shrinks from death and bodily hurt.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said to be "offered because it was His own will," i.e. Divine will and deliberate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will; although death was contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23,24).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This is plain from what has been said.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing was more powerful than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, absolutely; yet there was nothing to hinder a thing being more powerful in regard to this or that effect, as a nail for piercing. And this I say, in so far as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is considered in its own proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and power.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ contracted these defects?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> contracted bodily defects. For we are said to contract what we derive with our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from birth. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, derived His bodily defects and infirmities through His birth from His mother, whose flesh was subject to these defects. Therefore it seems that He contracted these defects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is derived together with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and hence is contracted. Now these penalties are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore Christ contracted them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is likened to other men in these defects, as is written <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse17">Hebrews 2:17</a>. But other men contract these defects. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> contracted these defects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> These defects are contracted through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>: "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, death." Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had no place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not contract these defects.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In the verb "to contract" is understood the relation of effect to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, i.e. that is said to be contracted which is derived of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> together with its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death and such like defects in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since "by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death entered into this world," according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>. And hence they who incur these defects, as due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are properly said to contract them. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not these defects, as due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Alcuin in the Gloss, Ord., expounding <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse31">John 3:31</a>, "He that cometh from above, is above all," says: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came from above, i.e. from the height of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which it had before the fall of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." For He received <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the purity which it had in the state of innocence. In the same way He might have assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without defects. Thus it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not contract these defects as if taking them upon Himself as due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but by His own will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The flesh of the Virgin was conceived in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, [See introductory note to 27] and therefore contracted these defects. But from the Virgin, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh assumed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and He might likewise have assumed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> without its penalties. But He wished to bear its penalties in order to carry out the work of our redemption, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore He had these defects--not that He contracted them, but that He assumed them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death and other corporeal defects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is twofold: the first is remote, and results from the material principles of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, inasmuch as it is made up of contraries. But this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was held in check by original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Hence the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death and other defects is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is withdrawn. And thus, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He is said not to have contracted these defects, but to have assumed them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was made like to other men in the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> and not in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these defects; and hence, unlike others, He did not contract them.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ ought to have assumed all the bodily defects of men?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have assumed all the bodily defects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6,18): "What is unassumable is incurable." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to cure all our defects. Therefore He ought to have assumed all our defects.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further it was said (1), that in order to satisfy for us, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have had perfective <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and defects of body. Now as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He assumed the fulness of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore as regards the body, He ought to have assumed all defects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, amongst all bodily defects death holds the chief place. Now Christ assumed death. Much more, therefore, ought He to have assumed other defects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Contraries cannot take place simultaneously in the same. Now some infirmities are contrary to each other, being <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by contrary principles. Hence it could not be that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmities.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1,2), Christ assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> defects in order to satisfy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and for this it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to have the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> ought to have assumed those defects which flow from the common <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet are not incompatible with the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And thus it was not fitting for Him to assume all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> defects or infirmities. For there are some defects that are incompatible with the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, a proneness towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and a difficulty in well-doing. Some other defects do not flow from the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in common on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, but are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> in some men by certain particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, epilepsy, and the like; and these defects are sometimes brought about by the fault of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, e.g. from inordinate eating; sometimes by a defect in the formative power. Now neither of these pertains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since His flesh was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who has <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom and power, and cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> or fail; and He Himself did nothing wrong in the order of His life. But there are some third defects, to be found amongst all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in common, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>, as death, hunger, thirst, and the like; and all these defects Christ assumed, which <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. i, 11; iii, 20) calls "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and indetractible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>" --<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as following all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in common; indetractible, as implying no defect of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> All particular defects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the corruptibility and passibility of the body, some particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> being added; and hence, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> healed the passibility and corruptibility of our body by assuming it, He consequently healed all other defects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fulness of all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was due to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of itself, from the fact of its being assumed by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and hence Christ assumed all the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom absolutely. But He assumed our defects economically, in order to satisfy for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not that they belonged to Him of Himself. Hence it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Him to assume them all, but only such as sufficed to satisfy for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Death comes to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a>; but not other defects, although they are less than death. Hence there is no parity.
