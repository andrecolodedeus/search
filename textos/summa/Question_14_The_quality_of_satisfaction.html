<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether a man can satisfy for one sin without satisfying for another?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a man can satisfy for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without satisfying for another. Because when several things are not connected together one can be taken away without another. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not connected together, else whoever had one would have them all. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be expiated by satisfaction, without another.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more merciful than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> accepts the payment of one debt without the payment of another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accepts satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the other.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15), "satisfaction is to uproot the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and give no opening to the suggestions thereof." Now this can be done with regard to one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not another, as when a mall curbs his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and perseveres in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Therefore we can make satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without satisfying for another.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The fast of those who fasted "for debates and strifes" (<a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse4">Isaiah 58:4-5</a>) was not acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> be a work of satisfaction. Now satisfaction cannot be made save by works that are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore he that has a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> cannot make satisfaction to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Further, satisfaction is a remedy for the healing of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and for preserving from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as stated above (Question 12, Article 3). But without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> it is impossible to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore, since each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> excludes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not possible to make satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not for another.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have held that it is possible to make satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not for another, as the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> states (Sent. iv, D, 15). But this cannot be. For since the previous offense has to be removed by satisfaction, the mode of satisfaction must needs be consistent with the removal of the offense. Now removal of offense is renewal of friendship: wherefore if there be anything to hinder the renewal of friendship there can be no satisfaction. Since, therefore, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a hindrance to the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which is the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to make satisfaction for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while holding to another: even as neither would a man make satisfaction to another for a blow, if while throwing himself at his feet he were to give him another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not connected together in some single one, a man can incur one without incurring another; whereas all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted by reason of one same thing, so that the remissions of various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are connected together. Consequently satisfaction cannot be made for one and not for another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When a man is under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to another by reason of a debt, the only inequality between them is that which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so that for restitution nothing further is required than that the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should be reinstated, and this can be done in respect of one debt without another. But when the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is based on an offense, there is inequality not only of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but also of friendship, so that for the offense to be removed by satisfaction, not only must the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be restored by the payment of a punishment equal to the offense, but also the equality of friendship must be reinstated, which is impossible so long as an obstacle to friendship remains.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> By its weight, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> drags us down to another, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxv): so that when a man holds to one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he does not sufficiently cut himself off from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of further <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether, when deprived of charity, a man can make satisfaction for sins for which he was previously contrite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that if a man fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after being <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> for all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he can, now that he has lost <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, satisfy for his other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which were already pardoned him through his <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> (<a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse24">Daniel 4:24</a>): "Redeem thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>." Yet he was still a sinner, as is shown by his subsequent punishment. Therefore a man can make satisfaction while in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not whether he be worthy of love or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>" (<a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>). If therefore one cannot make satisfaction unless one be in a state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it would be impossible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether one had made satisfaction, which would be unseemly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a man's entire action takes its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> which he had at the beginning. But a penitent is in a state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> when he begins to repent. Therefore his whole subsequent satisfaction will derive its efficacy from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> which quickens his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, satisfaction consists in a certain equalization of guilt to punishment. But these things can be equalized even in one who is devoid of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> covereth all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse12">Proverbs 10:12</a>). But satisfaction has the power of blotting out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore it is powerless without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p>Further, the chief work of satisfaction is <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> given by one who is devoid of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> avail nothing, as is clearly stated <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>, "If I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor . . . and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore there can be no satisfaction with mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that if, when all a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been pardoned through <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, and before he has made satisfaction for them, he falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then makes satisfaction, such satisfaction will be valid, so that if he die in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he will not be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p>But this cannot be, because satisfaction requires the reinstatement of friendship and the restoration of the equality of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the contrary of which destroys friendship, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ix, 1,3). Now in satisfaction made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the equality is based, not on equivalence but rather on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> acceptation: so that, although the offense be already removed by previous <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, the works of satisfaction must be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for this they are dependent on <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Consequently works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not satisfactory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel's</a> advice meant that he should give up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and repent, and so make satisfaction by giving <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not for certain whether he had <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> when making satisfaction, or whether he has it now, so too he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not for certain whether he made full satisfaction: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse5">Sirach 5:5</a>): "Be not without fear about <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> forgiven." And yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> need not, on account of that fear, repeat the satisfaction made, if he is not conscious of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For although he may not have expiated his punishment by that satisfaction, he does not incur the guilt of omission through neglecting to make satisfaction; even as he who receives the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> without being conscious of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which he is guilty, does not incur the guilt of receiving unworthily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> His <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> was interrupted by his subsequent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that it gives no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to the works done after that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Sufficient equalization is impossible both as to the Divine acceptation and as to equivalence: so that the argument proves nothing.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether previous satisfaction begins to avail after man is restored to charity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that when a man has recovered <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> his previous satisfaction begins to avail, because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/lev025.htm#verse25">Leviticus 25:25</a>, "If thy brother being impoverished," etc., says that "the fruit of a man's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works should be counted from the time when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>." But they would not be counted, unless they derived some efficacy from his subsequent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore they begin to avail after he recovers <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the efficacy of satisfaction is hindered by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is hindered by insincerity. Now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> begins to avail when insincerity ceases. Therefore satisfaction begins to avail when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is taken away.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if a man is given as a penance for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has committed, to fast for several days, and then, after falling again into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he completes his penance, he is not told, when he goes to confession a second time, to fast once again. But he would be told to do so, if he did not fulfill his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of satisfaction by them. Therefore his previous works become valid unto satisfaction, through his subsequent repentance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> were not satisfactory, through being dead works. But they are not quickened by penance. Therefore they do not begin to be satisfactory.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not quicken a work, unless in some way that work proceeds therefrom. But works cannot be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore cannot be satisfactory, unless they be quickened by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Since then the works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in no way proceeded from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, nor ever can proceed therefrom, they can by no means count towards satisfaction.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that works done while in a state of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which are called living works, are <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in respect of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and satisfactory in respect of paying off the debt of punishment; and that by subsequent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are quickened so as to be satisfactory, but not so as to be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>. But this is impossible, because works done in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> produce both these effects for the same reason, viz. because they are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> by its advent cannot make works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> to be pleasing in one respect, so neither can it make them pleasing in the other respect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This means that the fruits are reckoned, not from the time when he was first in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but from the time when he ceased to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when, to wit, he was last in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; unless he was <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> as soon as he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and did many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions before he confessed. Or we may say that the greater the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> the more it alleviates the punishment, and the more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions a man does while in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the more he disposes himself to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, so that it is probable that he owes a smaller debt of punishment. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should use discretion in taking them into account, so as to give him a lighter penance, according as he finds him better disposed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> imprints a character on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereas satisfaction does not. Hence on the advent of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which removes both insincerity and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> to have its effect, whereas it does not do this for satisfaction. Moreover <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> confers justification in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> [ex opere operato] which is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, wherefore it does not become a lifeless <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> as satisfaction does, which is a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sometimes satisfaction is such as to leave an effect in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who makes satisfaction, even after the act of satisfaction has been done; thus <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> leaves the body weak, and almsdeeds result in a diminution of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and so on. In such cases there is no need to repeat the works of satisfaction if they have been done while in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because through penance they are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the result they leave behind. But when a work of satisfaction leaves behind no effect in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> that does satisfaction, it needs to be repeated, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and so forth. Interior works, since they pass away altogether, are nowise quickened, and must be repeated.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether works done without charity merit any, at least temporal, good?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> some, at least a temporal, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For as punishment is to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act, so is reward to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> act. Now no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is unpunished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the just judge. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> is unrewarded, and so every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, reward is not given except for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Now some reward is given for works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse2">Matthew 6:2-16</a>) of those who do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that "they have received their reward." Therefore those works <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if there be two men both in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, one of whom does many <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves and in their circumstances, while the other does none, they are not equally near to the reception of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from Gods else the latter need not be advised to do any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now he that is nearer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> receives more of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Therefore the former, on account of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says that "the sinner is not worthy of the bread he eats." Therefore he cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> anything from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Further, he that is nothing, can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing. But a sinner, through not having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is nothing in respect of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> being, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>. Therefore he can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> nothing.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is an action on account of which it is just that the agent should be given something. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is twofold: first, there is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> properly so called, which regards something due on the part of the recipient. Secondly, there is metaphorical <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so to speak, which regards something due on the part of the giver, for it may be right for the giver to give something to which the receiver has no claim. In this sense the "fitness of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>" is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (Proslog. x) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is just when He spares the sinner, because this is befitting." And in this way <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is also twofold. The first is an act in respect of which the agent himself has a claim to receive something, and this is called <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of "condignity." The second is an act the result of which is that there is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of giving in the giver by reason of fittingness, wherefore it is called <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of "congruity." Now since in all gratuitous givings, the primary reason of the giving is love, it is impossible for anyone, properly speaking, to lay claim to a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, if he lack friendship. Wherefore, as all things, whether temporal or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, are bestowed on us by the bounty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no one can acquire a claim to any of them, save through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so that works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are not condignly <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> or temporal. But since it is befitting the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that wherever He finds a disposition He should grant the perfection, a man is said to <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> congruously some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Accordingly suchlike works avail for a threefold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, acquisition of temporal goods, disposition to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, habituation to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works. Since, however, this is not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> properly so called, we should grant that such works are not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, rather than that they are.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. viii, 14), since no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> what a son may do, he can never give back to his father the equal of what he has received from him a father can never become his son's debtor: and much less can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his debtor on account of equivalence of work. Consequently no work of ours can <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a reward by reason of its measure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but it can by reason of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which makes friends hold their possessions in common. Therefore, no matter how <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> a work may be, if it be done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it does not give <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a claim to receive anything from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> deserves an equivalent punishment according to the measure of its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, because no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has been done to us on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which He has done. Therefore, although an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> deserves condign punishment, nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> condign reward.

<p><strong>Reply to Objections 2 and 3.</strong> These arguments consider <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of congruity; while the other arguments consider <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of condignity.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the aforesaid works avail for the mitigation of the pains of hell?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aforesaid works do not avail for the mitigation of the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For the measure of punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will answer to the measure of guilt. But works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> do not diminish the measure of guilt. Neither, therefore, do they lessen the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, though <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in duration, is nevertheless finite in intensity. Now anything finite is done away with by finite subtraction. If therefore works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> canceled any of the punishment due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, those works might be so numerous, that the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> would be done away with altogether: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are more efficacious than works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion cx), "the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do not profit the damned in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." Much less therefore are those pains mitigated by works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> also says (Enchiridion cx): "Whomsoever they profit, either receive a full pardon, or at least find damnation itself more tolerable."

<p>Further, it is a greater thing to do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> than to omit an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>. But the omission of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> always avoids a punishment, even in one who lacks <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Much more, therefore, do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> void punishment.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Mitigation of the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> can be understood in two ways: first, as though one were delivered from the punishment which he already deserved, and thus, since no one is delivered from punishment unless he be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> from guilt, (for an effect is not diminished or taken away unless its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be diminished or taken away), the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> cannot be mitigated by works done without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, since they are unable to remove or diminish guilt. Secondly, so that the demerit of punishment is hindered; and thus the aforesaid works diminish the pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>--first because he who does such works escapes being guilty of omitting them--secondly, because such works dispose one somewhat to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from less contempt, and indeed is drawn away from many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thereby.

<p>These works do, however <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> a diminution or postponement of temporal punishment, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse27">1 Kings 21:27, seqq.</a>), as also the acquisition of temporal goods.

<p>Some, however, say that they mitigate the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, not by subtracting any of their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, but by strengthening the subject, so that he is more able to bear them. But this is impossible, because there is no strengthening without a diminution of passibility. Now passibility is according to the measure of guilt, wherefore if guilt is not removed, neither can the subject be strengthened.

<p>Some again say that the punishment is mitigated as to the remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, though not as to the pain of fire. But neither will this stand, because as the pain of fire is equal to the guilt, so also is the pain of the remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: so that what applies to one applies to the other.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
