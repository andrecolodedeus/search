<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether chastity is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For here we are treating of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, seemingly, belongs to the body: for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be chaste because he behaves in a certain way as regards the use of certain parts of the body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>," as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. But <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, apparently, is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, since it can be taken away by force from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is done. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in unbelievers. Yet some unbelievers are chaste. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the fruits are distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is reckoned among the fruits (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse23">Galatians 5:23</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Decem Chord. [Serm. ix de Tempore]): "Whereas thou shouldst excel thy wife in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, thou yieldest to the first onslaught of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, while thou wishest thy wife to be victorious."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Chastity takes its name from the fact that reason "chastises" <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which, like a child, needs curbing, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iii, 12). Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in being something moderated by reason, as shown above (I-II, 64, 1). Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Chastity does indeed reside in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as its subject, though its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is in the body. For it belongs to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> that a man make moderate use of bodily members in accordance with the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and the choice of his will.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 18), "so long as her mind holds to its purpose, whereby she has <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merited</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> even in body, not even the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> can deprive her body of its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which is safeguarded by her persevering <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>." He also says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that "in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is the companion of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, whereby it is resolved to suffer any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whatsoever rather than consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Contra Julian. iv, 3), "it is impossible to have any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unless one be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> just; nor is it possible to be just unless one live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Whence he argues that in unbelievers there is neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, nor any other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because, to wit, they are not referred to the due end, and as he adds (Contra Julian. iv, 3) "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are distinguished from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> not by their functions," i.e. their acts, "but by their ends."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Chastity is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as it works in accordance with reason, but in so far as it delights in its act, it is reckoned among the fruits.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether chastity is a general virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Mendacio xx) that "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is the well-ordered movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that does not prefer the lesser to the greater things." But this belongs to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Chastity" takes its name from "chastisement" [Cf. 1]. Now every movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part should be chastised by reason. Since, then, every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> curbs some movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it seems that every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is opposed to fornication. But fornication seems to belong to every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa072.htm#verse27">Psalm 72:27</a>): "Thou shalt destroy [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'hast destroyed'] all them that go awhoring from [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'are disloyal to'] Thee." Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Macrobius [In Somn. Scip. i, 8 reckons it to be a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>" is employed in two ways. First, properly; and thus it is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> having a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> relating to venereal pleasures. Secondly, the word "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>" is employed metaphorically: for just as a mingling of bodies conduces to venereal pleasure which is the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> its contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, so too the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with certain things conduces to a pleasure which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> metaphorically speaking, as well as of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication likewise metaphorically so called. For if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind delight in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> union with that to which it behooves it to be united, namely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and refrains from delighting in union with other things against the requirements of the order established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this may be called a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." If, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be united to any other things whatsoever, against the prescription of the Divine order, it will be called <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication, according to <a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 3:1</a>, "But thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers." Taking <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in this sense, it is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> withdraws the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind from delighting in a union with unlawful things. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of this <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> consists principally in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument takes <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in the metaphorical sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (1; 142, 2), the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of that which gives pleasure is especially likened to a child, because the desire of pleasure is connatural to us, especially of pleasures of touch which are directed to the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence it is that if the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of such pleasures be fostered by consenting to it, it will wax very strong, as in the case of a child left to his own will. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of these pleasures stands in very great need of being chastised: and consequently <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is applied antonomastically to such like <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is about those matters wherein we stand in the greatest need of strength of mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> fornication metaphorically so called, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as stated.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether chastity is a distinct virtue from abstinence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from abstinence. Because where the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is generically the same, one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> suffices. Now it would seem that things pertaining to the same sense are of one genus. Therefore, since pleasures of the palate which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of abstinence, and venereal pleasures which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, pertain to the touch, it seems that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from abstinence.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iii, 12) likens all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of intemperance to childish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which need chastising. Now "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>" takes its name from "chastisement" of the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Since then certain <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are bridled by abstinence, it seems that abstinence is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the pleasures of the other senses are the concern of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in so far as they refer to pleasures of touch; which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Now pleasures of the palate, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of abstinence, are directed to venereal pleasures, which are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Ep. cxlvii ad Amand. Cf. Gratian, Dist. xliv.], commenting on <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus 1:7</a>, "Not given to wine, no striker," etc.: "The belly and the organs of generation are neighbors, that the neighborhood of the organs may indicate their complicity in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." Therefore abstinence and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> are not distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 6:5-6</a>) reckons "<a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>" together with "fastings" which pertain to abstinence.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 141, Article 4), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is properly about the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the pleasures of touch: so that where there are different kinds of pleasure, there are different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> comprised under <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Now pleasures are proportionate to the actions whose perfections they are, as stated in Ethic. ix, 4,5: and it is evident that actions connected with the use of food whereby the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is maintained differ generically from actions connected with the use of matters venereal, whereby the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is preserved. Therefore <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, which is about venereal pleasures, is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from abstinence, which is about pleasures of the palate.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Temperance is chiefly about pleasures of touch, not as regards the sense's judgment concerning the objects of touch. which judgment is of uniform character concerning all such objects, but as regards the use itself of those objects, as stated in Ethic. iii, 10. Now the uses of meats, drinks, and venereal matters differ in character. Wherefore there must needs be different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, though they regard the one sense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Venereal pleasures are more impetuous, and are more oppressive on the reason than the pleasures of the palate: and therefore they are in greater need of chastisement and restraint, since if one consent to them this increases the force of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and weakens the strength of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 10): "I consider that nothing so casts down the manly mind from its heights as the fondling of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and those bodily contacts which belong to the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> state."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The pleasures of the other senses do not pertain to the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, except in so far as they are directed to pleasures of touch. Wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of such pleasures there is no other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comprised under <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But the pleasures of the palate, though directed somewhat to venereal pleasures, are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> directed to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life: wherefore by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they have a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is called abstinence directs its act to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> as its end.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether purity belongs especially to chastity?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that purity does not belong especially to chastity. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that "purity is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore it is not something belonging to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but is of itself a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "pudicitia" [purity] is derived from "pudor," which is equivalent to shame. Now shame, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> [De Fide Orth. ii, 15, is about a disgraceful act, and this is common to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts. Therefore purity belongs no more to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 12) that "every kind of intemperance is most deserving of reproach." Now it would seem to belong to purity to avoid all that is deserving of reproach. Therefore purity belongs to all the parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and not especially to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Perseverantia xx): "We must give praise to purity, that he who has ears to hear, may put to none but a lawful use the organs intended for procreation." Now the use of these organs is the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Therefore purity belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Objection 2), "pudicitia" [purity] takes its name from "pudor," which signifies shame. Hence purity must needs be properly about the things of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is most ashamed. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are most ashamed of venereal acts, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (De Civ. Dei xiv, 18), so much so that even the conjugal act, which is adorned by the honesty [Cf. 145] of marriage, is not devoid of shame: and this because the movement of the organs of generation is not subject to the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as are the movements of the other external members. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is ashamed not only of this sexual union but also of all the signs thereof, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Rhet. ii, 6). Consequently purity regards venereal matters properly, and especially the signs thereof, such as impure looks, kisses, and touches. And since the latter are more wont to be observed, purity regards rather these external signs, while <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> regards rather sexual union. Therefore purity is directed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, not as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct therefrom, but as expressing a circumstance of chastity. Nevertheless the one is sometimes used to designate the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is here speaking of purity as designating <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> has a certain disgrace, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of intemperance are especially disgraceful, as stated above (Question 142, Article 4).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of intemperance, venereal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are most deserving of reproach, both on account of the insubordination of the genital organs, and because by these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> especially, the reason is absorbed.
