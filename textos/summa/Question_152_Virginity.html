<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether virginity consists in integrity of the flesh?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> does not consist in integrity of the flesh. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nup. et Concup.) [The quotation is from De Sancta Virgin. xiii] that "<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the continual meditation on incorruption in a corruptible flesh." But meditation does not concern the flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not situated in the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> denotes a kind of purity. Now <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that "purity dwells in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not incorruption of the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the integrity of the flesh would seem to consist in the seal of virginal purity. Yet sometimes the seal is broken without loss of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that "those organs may be injured through being wounded by mischance. Physicians, too, sometimes do for the sake of health that which makes one shudder to see: and a midwife has been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to destroy by touch the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> that she sought." And he adds: "Nobody, I think, would be so foolish as to deem this <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> to have forfeited even bodily sanctity, though she lost the integrity of that organ." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> does not consist in incorruption of the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, corruption of the flesh consists chiefly in resolution of the semen: and this may take place without copulation, whether one be asleep or awake. Yet seemingly <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not lost without copulation: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xiii) that "virginal integrity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> that refrains from all sexual intercourse is the portion of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> does not consist in incorruption of the flesh.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. viii) that "<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> whereby integrity of the flesh is vowed, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and observed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virginity</a> takes its name apparently from "viror" [freshness], and just as a thing is described as fresh and retaining its freshness, so long as it is not parched by excessive heat, so too, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> denotes that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> possessed thereof is unseared by the heat of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which is experienced in achieving the greatest bodily pleasure which is that of sexual intercourse. Hence, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Virgin. i, 5) that "virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is integrity free of pollution."

<p>Now venereal pleasures offer three points for consideration. The first is on the part of the body, viz. the violation of the seal of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. The second is the link between that which concerns the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and that which concerns the body, and this is the resolution of the semen, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> sensible pleasure. The third is entirely on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely the purpose of attaining this pleasure. Of these three the first is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the moral act, which as such must be considered in reference to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The second stands in the relation of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the moral act, since the sensible <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are the matters of moral acts. But the third stands in the position of form and complement, because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> is perfected in that which concerns the reason. Since then <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> consists in freedom from the aforesaid corruption, it follows that the integrity of the bodily organ is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; while freedom from pleasure in resolution of the semen is related thereto materially; and the purpose of perpetually abstaining from this pleasure is the formal and completive element in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This definition of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> expresses directly that which is formal in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For "meditation" denotes reason's purpose; and the addition "perpetual" does not imply that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> must always retain this meditation actually, but that she should bear in mind the purpose of always persevering therein. The material element is expressed indirectly by the words "on incorruption in a corruptible body." This is added to show the difficulty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: for if the flesh were incorruptible, it would not be difficult to maintain a perpetual meditation on incorruption.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that purity, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but as to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it is in the body: and it is the same with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. viii) that "although <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> resides in the flesh," and for this reason is a bodily <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>, "yet it is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> thing, which a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> fosters and preserves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, the integrity of a bodily organ is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, in so far as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, through purposely abstaining from venereal pleasure, retains the integrity of a bodily organ. Hence if the organ lose its integrity by chance in some other way, this is no more prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> than being deprived of a hand or foot.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Pleasure resulting from resolution of semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> purpose, it destroys <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, whether copulation takes place or not. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> result thereof. On another way this may happen beside the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, either during sleep, or through <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and without the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again through weakness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as in the case of those who are subject to a flow of semen. On such cases <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not forfeit, because such like pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether virginity is unlawful?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is unlawful. For whatever is contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is unlawful. Now just as the words of <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse16">Genesis 2:16</a>, "Of every tree" that is in "paradise, thou shalt eat," indicate a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, in reference to the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, so also the words of <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis 1:28</a>, "Increase and multiply, and fill the earth," express a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, in reference to the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore just as it would be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to abstain from all food, as this would be to act counter to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, so too it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to abstain altogether from the act of procreation, for this is to act against the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever declines from the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is apparently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> declines from the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it abstains from all venereal pleasures: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 2), that "he who revels in every pleasure, and abstains from not even one, is intemperate: but he who refrains from all is loutish and insensible." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is something <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, punishment is not due save for a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now in olden times those were punished who led a celibate life, as Valerius Maximus asserts [Dict. Fact. Mem. ii, 9. Hence according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. iii) <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> "is said to have sacrificed to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in order that he might <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atone</a> for his perpetual <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a> as though it were a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> No <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a matter of direct counsel. But <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a matter of direct counsel: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>): "Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not an unlawful thing.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, those are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> which are against right reason. Now right reason requires that things directed to an end should be used in a measure proportionate to that end. Again, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is threefold as stated in Ethic. i, 8; one consisting in external things, for instance <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>; another, consisting in bodily goods; the third, consisting in the goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> among which the goods of the contemplative life take precedence of the goods of the active life, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> shows (Ethic. x, 7), and as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> declared (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse42">Luke 10:42</a>), "<a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary</a> hath chosen the better part." Of these goods those that are external are directed to those which belong to the body, and those which belong to the body are directed to those which belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and furthermore those which belong to the active life are directed to those which belong to the life of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Accordingly, right reason dictates that one use external goods in a measure proportionate to the body, and in like manner as regards the rest. Wherefore if a man refrain from possessing certain things (which otherwise it were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him to possess), for the sake of his body's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, but in accord with right reason. On like manner if a man abstain from bodily pleasures, in order more freely to give himself to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this is in accordance with the rectitude of reason. Now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> refrains from all venereal pleasure in order more freely to have leisure for Divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>): "The unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in both body and in spirit. But she that is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband." Therefore it follows that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> instead of being <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> is worthy of praise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A precept implies a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, as stated above (Question 122, Article 1). Now there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. There is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> that has to be fulfilled by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of this kind cannot be set aside without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> has to be fulfilled by the multitude, and the fulfilment of this kind of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is not binding on each one of the multitude. For the multitude has many <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which cannot be discharged by the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>; but are fulfilled by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> doing this, and another doing that. Accordingly the precept of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> which binds <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to eat must needs be fulfilled by each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, otherwise the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cannot be sustained. On the other hand, the precept of procreation regards the whole multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which needs not only to multiply in body, but also to advance spiritually. Wherefore sufficient provision is made for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> multitude, if some betake themselves to carnal procreation, while others abstaining from this betake themselves to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things, for the beauty and welfare of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Thus too in an army, some take sentry <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, others are standard-bearers, and others fight with the sword: yet all these things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the multitude, although they cannot be done by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, beside the dictate of right reason, abstains from all pleasures through aversion, as it were, for pleasure as such, is insensible as a country lout. But a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> does not refrain from every pleasure, but only from that which is venereal: and abstains therefrom according to right reason, as stated above. Now the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is fixed with reference, not to <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> but to right reason, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6: wherefore it is said of the magnanimous (Ethic. iv, 3) that "in point of <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> he goes to the extreme, but in point of becomingness he follows the mean."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Laws are framed according to what occurs more frequently. Now it seldom happened in olden times that anyone refrained from all venereal pleasure through love of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> alone is related to have done. Hence it was not through thinking this a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that he offered sacrifice, but "because he yielded to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion of his fellow countrymen," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (De Vera Relig. iii).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether virginity is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For "no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 1). Now <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since all are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> when born. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (I-II, 65, 1). Yet some have other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without having <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: else, since none can go to the heavenly kingdom without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, no one could go there without <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which would involve the condemnation of marriage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is recovered by penance. But <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not recovered by penance: wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Ep. xxii ad Eustoch.]: "Other things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can do, but He cannot restore the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after her downfall." Therefore seemingly <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is lost without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is lost without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely by marriage. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is condivided with <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> and conjugal purity. But neither of these is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Virgin. i, 3): "Love of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> moves us to say something about <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, lest by passing it over we should seem to cast a slight on what is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of high degree."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the formal and completive element in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the purpose of abstaining from venereal pleasure, which purpose is rendered praiseworthy by its end, in so far, to wit, as this is done in order to have leisure for Divine things: while the material element in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is integrity of the flesh free of all experience of venereal pleasure. Now it is manifest that where a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> action has a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> through having a special excellence, there is a special kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: for example, magnificence which is about great expenditure is for this reason a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> distinct from liberality, which is about all uses of money in general. Now to keep oneself free from the experience of venereal pleasure has an excellence of its own deserving of greater praise than keeping oneself free from inordinate venereal pleasure. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being related to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> as magnificence to liberality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Men have from their birth that which is material in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, namely integrity of the flesh and freedom from venereal experience. But they have not that which is formal in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, namely the purpose of safeguarding this integrity for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, which purpose gives <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> its character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xi): "Nor do we praise <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> for being <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, but, because their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Virtues are connected together by reason of that which is formal in them, namely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or by reason of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as stated above (129, 3, ad 2), but not by reason of that which is material in them. For nothing hinders a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from providing the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, but not that of magnificence. It is in this way that one who has the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> lacks the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, namely the aforesaid integrity of the flesh: nevertheless he can have that which is formal in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, his mind being so prepared that he has the purpose of safeguarding this same integrity of the flesh, should it be fitting for him to do so: even as a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be so prepared in mind as to have the purpose of being magnificent in his expenditure, were he in a position to do so: or again as a prosperous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so prepared in mind as to purpose bearing misfortune with equanimity: without which preparedness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Virtue can be recovered by penance as regards that which is formal in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but not as to that which is material therein. For if a magnificent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has squandered all his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> he does not recover his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> by repenting of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On like manner a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has lost <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, recovers by repenting, not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> but the purpose of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p>As regards the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> there is that which can be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> restored by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely the integrity of the organ, which we hold to be <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: while there is something else which cannot be restored even by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, to wit, that one who has experienced venereal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> should cease to have had that experience. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot make that which is done not to have been done, as stated in I, 25, 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">Virginity</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> denotes the purpose, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, of observing perpetual integrity. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. viii) that "by <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, integrity of the flesh is vowed, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and observed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> of both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh." Hence <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is never lost without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is deserving of praise merely because it abstains from unlawful pleasures: hence no excellence attaches to it above that of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in general. Widowhood, however, adds something to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in general; but it does not attain to that which is perfect in this matter, namely to entire freedom from venereal pleasure; <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> alone achieves this. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> alone is accounted a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> above <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, even as magnificence is reckoned above liberality.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether virginity is more excellent than marriage?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not more excellent than marriage. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xxi): "Continence was equally <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> in John who remained unmarried and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who begot children." Now a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has greater <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the praise accorded a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> depends on his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If, then, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> were preferable to conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, it would seem to follow that every <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is to be praised more than any <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not preferable to marriage.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> takes precedence of the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 2). Now marriage is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xvi): "What food is to a man's wellbeing, such is sexual intercourse to the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>." On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is ordered to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely in order to avoid what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> calls the "tribulation of the flesh," to which <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> people are subject (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not greater than conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xix): "Both solid reason and the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> show that neither is marriage <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, nor is it to be equaled to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of virginal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> or even to that of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Contra Jovin. i) the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Jovinian consisted in holding <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> not to be preferable to marriage. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is refuted above all by the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who both chose a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> for His mother, and remained Himself a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and by the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> who (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>) counsels <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is also refuted by reason, both because a Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> takes precedence of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is preferable to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, and again because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the contemplative life is better than that of the active life. Now <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in respect of the contemplative life, which consists in thinking "on the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the Lord'], whereas marriage is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the body, namely the bodily increase of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and belongs to the active life, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who embrace the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> life have to think "on the things of the world," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>). Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is preferable to conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Merit is measured not only by the kind of action, but still more by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the agent. Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had a mind so disposed, that he was prepared to observe <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, if it were in keeping with the times for him to do so. Wherefore in him conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> was equally <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> with the virginal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> of John, as regards the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> reward, but not as regards the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> reward. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xxi) that both "the celibacy of John and the marriage of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> fought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> battle in keeping with the difference of the times: but John was continent even in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was continent only in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is better than conjugal <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be better than a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> for two reasons. First, on the part of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> itself; if to wit, the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is more prepared in mind to observe <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, if it should be expedient, than the one who is actually a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Bono Conjug. xxii) charges the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to say: "I am no better than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of celibacy is better than the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of marriage." Further on he gives the reason for this: "For what I do now, he would have done better, if it were fitting for him to do it then; and what they did I would even do now if it behooved me now to do it." Secondly, because perhaps the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> has some more excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xliv): "Whence does a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that belong to the Lord, however solicitous she be about them, if perchance on account of some <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> fault she be not yet ripe for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, whereas this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to whom she delighted in preferring herself is already able to drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the Lord?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> takes precedence of the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if it be of the same genus: but it may be that the private <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is better generically. It is thus that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> that is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is preferable to carnal fruitfulness. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. ix): "It must be confessed that the fruitfulness of the flesh, even of those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who in these times seek naught else from marriage but children in order to make them servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cannot compensate for lost <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>."

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether virginity is the greatest of virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (De Virgin. [De Habitu Virg.]): "We address ourselves now to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Sublime is their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but no less exalted is their vocation. They are a flower of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> sowing, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and ornament of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> portion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a greater reward is due to the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the greatest reward is due to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, namely the hundredfold fruit, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse23">Matthew 13:23</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> conforms us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the greater it is. Now <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> above all conforms us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; for it is declared in the <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Apocalypse 14:4</a> that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> "follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth," and (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse3">Apocalypse 14:3</a>) that they sing "a new canticle," which "no" other "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" could say. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xlvi): "No one, methinks, would dare prefer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>," and (De Virgin. xlv): "The authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> informs the faithful in no uncertain manner, so that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what place the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who have departed this life are commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Altar</a>." By this we are given to understand that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and also the monastic state, are preferable to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing may excel all others in two ways. First, in some particular genus: and thus <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is most excellent, namely in the genus of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, since it surpasses the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> both of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> and of marriage. And because comeliness is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> antonomastically, it follows that surpassing beauty is ascribed to chastity. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Virgin. i, 7): "Can anyone esteem any beauty greater than a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a>, since she is beloved of her King, approved by her Judge, dedicated to her Lord, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" Secondly, a thing may be most excellent simply, and in this way <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not the most excellent of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Because the end always excels that which is directed to the end; and the more effectively a thing is directed to the end, the better it is. Now the end which renders <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> praiseworthy is that one may have leisure for Divine things, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Wherefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of religion, the acts of which consist in being occupied about Divine things, are preferable to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> work more mightily in order to cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--since for this end they hold their own life in contempt; and those who dwell in monasteries--since for this end they give up their own will and all that they may possess--than <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who renounce venereal pleasure for that same purpose. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not simply the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Virgins are "the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> portion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock," and "their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> more sublime" in comparison with <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The hundredfold fruit is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Ep. cxxiii ad Ageruch.], on account of its superiority to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, to which the sixtyfold fruit is ascribed, and to marriage, to which is ascribed the thirtyfold fruit. But according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De QQ. Evang. i, 9), "the hundredfold fruit is given to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the sixtyfold to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and the thirtyfold to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>." Wherefore it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is simply the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only in comparison with other degrees of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Virgins "follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth," because they imitate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by integrity not only of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> but also of the flesh, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virgin. xxvii). Wherefore they follow the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> in more ways, but this does not imply that they follow more closely, because other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> make us cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more closely by imitation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. The "new <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>" which <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone sing, is their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at having preserved integrity of the flesh.
