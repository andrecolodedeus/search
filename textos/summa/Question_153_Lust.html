<h1>Question 153. Lust</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3153.htm#article1"> What is the matter of lust?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3153.htm#article2"> Is all copulation unlawful?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3153.htm#article3"> Is lust a mortal sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3153.htm#article4"> Is lust a capital vice?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3153.htm#article5"> Its daughters</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the matter of lust is only venereal desires and pleasures?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not only venereal desires and pleasures. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> affects to be called surfeit and abundance." But surfeit regards meat and drink, while abundance refers to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not properly about venereal desires and pleasures.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse1">Proverbs 20:1</a>): "Wine is a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'luxurious'] thing." Now wine is connected with pleasure of meat and drink. Therefore these would seem to be the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is defined "as the desire of wanton pleasure" [<a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, Summ. Theol. ii, cxvli]. But wanton pleasure regards not only venereal matters but also many others. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not only about venereal desires and pleasures.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> it is said (De Vera Relig. iii [Written by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>]): "He that soweth in the flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption." Now the sowing of the flesh refers to venereal pleasures. Therefore these belong to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x), "a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is debauched with pleasures." Now venereal pleasures above all debauch a man's mind. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is especially concerned with such like pleasures.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> chiefly and properly applies to pleasures of touch, yet consequently and by a kind of likeness is referred to other matters, so too, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> applies chiefly to venereal pleasures, which more than anything else work the greatest havoc in a man's mind, yet secondarily it applies to any other matters pertaining to excess. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a> says "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is any kind of surfeit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Wine is said to be a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> thing, either in the sense in which surfeit in any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or because the use of too much wine affords an incentive to venereal pleasure.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although wanton pleasure applies to other matters, the name of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> has a special application to venereal pleasures, to which also wantonness is specially applicable, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (De Civ. xiv, 15,16).

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether no venereal act can be without sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no venereal act can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would seem to hinder <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now every venereal act is a great hindrance to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. i, 10): "I consider that nothing so casts down the manly mind from its height as the fondling of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and those bodily contacts." Therefore, seemingly, no venereal act is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, any excess that makes one forsake the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is corrupted by "excess" and "deficiency" as stated in Ethic. ii, 2. Now in every venereal act there is excess of pleasure, since it so absorbs the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that "it is incompatible with the act of understanding," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes (Ethic. vii, 11); and as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. vi in Num.; Cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Ep. cxxiii ad Ageruch.] states, rendered the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for the moment, insensible to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Therefore no venereal act can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more powerful than its effect. Now <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted to children by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, without which no venereal act is possible, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (De Nup. et Concup. i, 24). Therefore no venereal act can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xxv): "This is a sufficient answer to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if only they will understand that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed in that which is against neither <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nor morals, nor a commandment": and he refers to the act of sexual intercourse between the patriarchs of old and their several wives. Therefore not every venereal act is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, is that which is against the order of reason. Now the order of reason consists in its ordering everything to its end in a fitting manner. Wherefore it is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if one, by the dictate of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, makes use of certain things in a fitting manner and order for the end to which they are adapted, provided this end be something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now just as the preservation of the bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so, too, is the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> a very great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And just as the use of food is directed to the preservation of life in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, so is the use of venereal acts directed to the preservation of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xvi): "What food is to a man's well being, such is sexual intercourse to the welfare of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>." Wherefore just as the use of food can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it be taken in due manner and order, as required for the welfare of the body, so also the use of venereal acts can be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided they be performed in due manner and order, in keeping with the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> procreation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing may be a hindrance to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. First, as regards the ordinary degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and as to this nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Secondly, as regards the perfect degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and as to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be hindered by that which is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a lesser <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On this way sexual intercourse casts down the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> not from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but from the height, i.e. the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. viii): "Just as that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which Martha did when busy about serving <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, yet better still that which Mary did in hearing the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so, too, we praise the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of Susanna's conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, yet we prefer the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Anna, and much more that of the Virgin Mary."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (152, 2, ad 2; I-II, 64, 2), the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends not on <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a> but on conformity with right reason: and consequently the exceeding pleasure attaching to a venereal act directed according to reason, is not opposed to the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not concerned with the amount of pleasure experienced by the external sense, as this depends on the disposition of the body; what matters is how much the interior <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is affected by that pleasure. Nor does it follow that the act in question is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, from the fact that the free <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in considering <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things is incompatible with the aforesaid pleasure. For it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be sometimes interrupted for something that is done in accordance with reason, else it would be against <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to set himself to sleep. That venereal <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and pleasure are not subject to the command and moderation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is due to the punishment of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as the reason, for rebelling against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deserved that its body should rebel against it, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 13).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 13), "the child, shackled with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, is born of fleshly <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> (which is not imputed as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the regenerate) as of a daughter of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Hence it does not follow that the act in question is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that it contains something penal resulting from the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the lust that is about venereal acts can be a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> about venereal acts cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the venereal act consists in the emission of semen which is the surplus from food, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Gener. Anim. i, 18). But there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> attaching to the emission of other superfluities. Therefore neither can there be any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in venereal acts.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, everyone can lawfully make what use he pleases of what is his. But in the venereal act a man uses only what is his own, except perhaps in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or rape. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in venereal acts, and consequently <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has an opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But, seemingly, no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is more powerful than its effect. Now wine is forbidden on account of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians 5:18</a>), "Be not drunk with wine wherein is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'luxury']." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is forbidden.

<p>Further, it is numbered among the works of the flesh: <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'luxury'].

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> a thing is, the more it behooves one to observe the order of reason in its regard; wherefore the more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> it becomes if the order of reason be forsaken. Now the use of venereal acts, as stated in the foregoing Article, is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Wherefore there is the greatest <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for observing the order of reason in this matter: so that if anything be done in this connection against the dictate of reason's ordering, it will be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in exceeding the order and mode of reason in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of venereal acts. Wherefore without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says in the same book (De Gener. Anim. i, 18), "the semen is a surplus that is needed." For it is said to be superfluous, because it is the residue from the action of the nutritive power, yet it is needed for the work of the generative power. But the other superfluities of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body are such as not to be needed, so that it matters not how they are emitted, provided one observe the decencies of social life. It is different with the emission of semen, which should be accomplished in a manner befitting the end for which it is needed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>) in speaking against <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, "You are bought with a great price: glorify and bear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in your body." Wherefore by inordinately using the body through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> a man wrongs <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the Supreme Lord of our body. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Decem. Chord. 10 [Serm. ix (xcvi de Temp.)]): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who thus governs His servants for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not for His, made this order and commandment, lest unlawful pleasures should destroy His temple which thou hast begun to be."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The opposite of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not found in many, since men are more inclined to pleasure. Yet the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is comprised under insensibility, and occurs in one who has such a dislike for sexual intercourse as not to pay the marriage debt.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether lust is a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is apparently the same as "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ephesians 5:3</a> (Cf. <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). But <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is a daughter of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii, 39) that "as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of mind leads to the depravity of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of mind safeguard the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the flesh." Now it is seemingly contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to arise from another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, according to <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse19">Ephesians 4:19</a>, "Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness." But <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is not a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; indeed, it is accounted a daughter of sloth, as stated above (35, 4, ad 2). Much less, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) places <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (148, 5; I-II, 84, 3,4), a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is one that has a very desirable end, so that through desire for that end, a man proceeds to commit many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, all of which are said to arise from that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> as from a principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now the end of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is venereal pleasure, which is very great. Wherefore this pleasure is very desirable as regards the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, both on account of the intensity of the pleasure, and because such like <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 148, Article 6), according to some, the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> which is reckoned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is a certain <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the body, and thus the objection is not to the point. If, however, it denote the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, we must reply that it is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> materially--in so far as <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> provides the bodily <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>--and not under the aspect of final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in which respect chiefly the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are said to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (132, 4, ad 1), when we were treating of vainglory, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is accounted the common mother of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that even the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> originate therefrom.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> refrain from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> pleasures chiefly through hope of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come, which hope is removed by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, so that the latter is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as removing an obstacle thereto, not as its direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; whereas this is seemingly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the daughters of lust are fittingly described?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are unfittingly reckoned to be "blindness of mind, thoughtlessness, inconstancy, rashness, self-love, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, love of this world and abhorrence or <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of a future world." For <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> blindness, thoughtlessness and rashness pertain to imprudence, which is to be found in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> is in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore they should not be reckoned especially as daughters of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, constancy is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as stated above (128, ad 6; 137, 3). But <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is contrary, not to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> but to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore inconstancy is not a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Self-love extending to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is the origin of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28). Therefore it should not be accounted a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> [QQ. in Deut., qu. xvi] mentions four, namely, "obscene," "scurrilous," "wanton" and "foolish talking." There the aforesaid enumeration would seem to be superfluous.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When the lower powers are strongly moved towards their objects, the result is that the higher powers are hindered and disordered in their acts. Now the effect of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is that the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, is most vehemently intent on its object, to wit, the object of pleasure, on account of the vehemence of the pleasure. Consequently the higher powers, namely the reason and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, are most grievously disordered by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p>Now the reason has four acts in matters of action. First there is simple understanding, which apprehends some end as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this act is hindered by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, according to <a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse56">Daniel 13:56</a>, "Beauty hath deceived thee, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> hath perverted thy heart." On this respect we have "blindness of mind." The second act is counsel about what is to be done for the sake of the end: and this is also hindered by the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Hence Terence says (Eunuch., act 1, sc. 1), speaking of lecherous love: "This thing admits of neither counsel nor moderation, thou canst not control it by counseling." On this respect there is "rashness," which denotes absence of counsel, as stated above (Question 53, Article 3). The third act is judgment about the things to be done, and this again is hindered by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For it is said of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> old men (<a href="../bible/dan013.htm#verse9">Daniel 13:9</a>): "They perverted their own mind . . . that they might not . . . remember just judgments." On this respect there is "thoughtlessness." The fourth act is the reason's command about the thing to be done, and this also is impeded by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, in so far as through being carried away by <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, a man is hindered from doing what his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> ordered to be done. [To this "inconstancy" must be referred.] [The sentence in brackets is omitted in the Leonine edition.] Hence Terence says (Eunuch., act 1, sc. 1) of a man who declared that he would leave his mistress: "One little <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> tear will undo those words."

<p>On the part of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> there results a twofold inordinate act. One is the desire for the end, to which we refer "self-love," which regards the pleasure which a man desires inordinately, while on the other hand there is "<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," by reason of His forbidding the desired pleasure. The other act is the desire for the things directed to the end. With regard to this there is "love of this world," whose pleasures a man desires to enjoy, while on the other hand there is "<a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of a future world," because through being held back by carnal pleasures he cares not to obtain <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> pleasures, since they are distasteful to him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vi, 5), intemperance is the chief corruptive of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> arise chiefly from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is the principal <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of intemperance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The constancy which is a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> regards hardships and objects of fear; but constancy in refraining from pleasures pertains to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> which is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (143). Hence the inconstancy which is opposed thereto is to be reckoned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Nevertheless even the first named inconstancy arises from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, inasmuch as the latter enfeebles a man's heart and renders it effeminate, according to <a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse11">Hosea 4:11</a>, "Fornication and wine and drunkenness take away the heart [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'understanding']." Vegetius, too, says (De Re Milit. iii) that "the less a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of the pleasures of life, the less he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> death." Nor is there any need, as we have repeatedly stated, for the daughters of a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to agree with it in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> (cf. 35, 4, ad 2; 118, 8, ad 1; 148, 6).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Self-love in respect of any goods that a man desires for himself is the common origin of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but in the special point of desiring carnal pleasures for oneself, it is reckoned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> are inordinate external acts, pertaining in the main to speech; wherein there is a fourfold inordinateness. First, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and to this we refer "obscene words": for since "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew 12:34</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose heart is full of lewd <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, readily breaks out into lewd words. Secondly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: for, since <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> thoughtlessness and rashness, the result is that it makes a man speak without weighing or giving a thought to his words. which are described as "scurrilous." Thirdly, on account of the end: for since the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks pleasure, he directs his speech thereto, and so gives utterance to "wanton words." Fourthly, on account of the sentiments expressed by his words, for through <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> blindness of mind, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> perverts a man's sentiments, and so he gives way "to foolish talking," for instance, by expressing a preference for the pleasures he desires to anything else.
