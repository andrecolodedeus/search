<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether six species are fittingly assigned to lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that six <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are unfittingly assigned to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, namely, "simple fornication, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>, seduction, rape, and the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." For diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> does not diversify the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Now the aforesaid division is made with regard to diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with whom a man has intercourse is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or of some other <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are diversified in this way.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are not differentiated by things that belong to another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> does not differ from simple fornication, save in the point of a man having intercourse with one who is another's, so that he commits an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as a man may happen to have intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is bound to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by marriage, so may it happen that a man has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> should be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only if he be with another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but also if he use his own wife inordinately. But the latter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is comprised under <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore it should be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>): "Lest again, when I come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me among you, and I mourn many of them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before, and have not done penance for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed." Therefore it seems that also <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and lasciviousness should be reckoned <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as well as fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the thing divided is not to be reckoned among its parts. But <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is reckoned together with the aforesaid: for it is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19</a>): "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, immodesty, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'luxury']." Therefore it seems that fornication is unfittingly reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The aforesaid division is given in the Decretals 36, qu. i [Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa].

<p><strong>I answer that</strong> As stated above (Question 153, Article 3), the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> consists in seeking venereal pleasure not in accordance with right reason. This may happen in two ways. First, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein this pleasure is sought; secondly, when, whereas there is due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, other due circumstances are not observed. And since a circumstance, as such, does not specify a moral act, whose <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is derived from its object which is also its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> must be assigned with respect to its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or object.

<p>Now this same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be discordant with right reason in two ways. First, because it is inconsistent with the end of the venereal act. On this way, as hindering the begetting of children, there is the "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," which attaches to every venereal act from which generation cannot follow; and, as hindering the due upbringing and advancement of the child when born, there is "simple fornication," which is the union of an unmarried <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with an unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein the venereal act is consummated may be discordant with right reason in relation to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and this in two ways. First, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, with whom a man has connection, by reason of due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> not being paid to her; and thus there is "<a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>," which consists in the misuse of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity. Secondly, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> under whose authority the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is placed: and if she be under the authority of a husband, it is "<a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>," if under the authority of her father, it is "seduction," in the absence of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and "rape" if <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> be employed.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are differentiated on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> rather than of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because in the venereal act the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is passive and is by way of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is by way of agent; and it has been stated above (Objection 1) that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are assigned with regard to a difference of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The aforesaid diversity of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is connected with a formal difference of object, which difference results from different modes of opposition to right reason, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (I-II, 18, 07), nothing hinders the deformities of different <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> concurring in the one act, and in this way <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is comprised under <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Nor is this deformity of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> altogether <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: since the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that obeys <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> so far as to lead to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, is thereby shown to be more grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by vowing <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, contracts a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> marriage with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> that is committed in the violation of such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. On like manner, the other kinds of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> are reduced to other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a husband with his wife is not connected with undue <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but with other circumstances, which do not constitute the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of a moral act, as stated above (I-II, 18, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this passage, "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>" stands for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while "lasciviousness" is a man's abuse of boys, wherefore it would appear to pertain to seduction. We may also reply that "lasciviousness" relates to certain acts circumstantial to the venereal act, for instance kisses, touches, and so forth.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> According to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on this passage "<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>" there signifies any kind of excess.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether simple fornication is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that simple fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For things that come under the same head would seem to be on a par with one another. Now fornication comes under the same head as things that are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse29">Acts 15:29</a>): "That you abstain from things sacrificed to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication." But there is not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in these observances, according to <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, "Nothing is rejected that is received with thanksgiving." Therefore fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a Divine precept. But the Lord commanded (<a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse2">Hosea 1:2</a>): "Go take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications." Therefore fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> without disapprobation. Yet simple fornication is mentioned without disapprobation by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> in connection with the patriarchs. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse4">Genesis 16:4</a>) that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went in to his handmaid Agar; and further on (<a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse5">Genesis 30:5-9</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> went in to Bala and Zelpha the handmaids of his wives; and again (<a href="../bible/gen038.htm#verse18">Genesis 38:18</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was with Thamar whom he thought to be a harlot. Therefore simple fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But simple fornication is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, neither as regards the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly against. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor as regards the love of our neighbor, since thereby no one is injured. Therefore simple fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> leads to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> perdition. But simple fornication has not this result: because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [The quotation is from the Gloss of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, who refers it to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>: whereas it is from <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>] on <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a> is profitable to all things," says: "The whole of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching is summed up in mercy and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>: if a man conforms to this, even though he gives way to the inconstancy of the flesh, doubtless he will be punished, but he will not perish." Therefore simple fornication is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Bono Conjug. xvi) that "what food is to the well-being of the body, such is sexual intercourse to the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>." But inordinate use of food is not always a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither is all inordinate sexual intercourse; and this would seem to apply especially to simple fornication, which is the least grievous of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse13">Tobit 4:13</a>): "Take heed to keep thyself . . . from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a crime." Now crime denotes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore fornication and all intercourse with other than one's wife is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, nothing but mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> debars a man from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> kingdom. But fornication debars him, as shown by the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians 5:21</a>), who after mentioning fornication and certain other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, adds: "They who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." Therefore simple fornication is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Further, it is written in the Decretals (XXII, qu. i, can. Praedicandum): "They should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the same penance is to be enjoined for perjury as for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, fornication, and wilful <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and other criminal offenses." Therefore simple fornication is a criminal or mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we must hold simple fornication to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, notwithstanding that a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, QQ. in Deut., qu. 37 on <a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>, says: "This is a prohibition against going with whores, whose vileness is venial." For instead of "venial" it should be "venal," since such is the wanton's trade. On order to make this evident, we must take note that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed directly against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now simple fornication implies an inordinateness that tends to injure the life of the offspring to be born of this union. For we find in all animals where the upbringing of the offspring needs care of both male and female, that these come together not indeterminately, but the male with a certain female, whether one or several; such is the case with all birds: while, on the other hand, among those animals, where the female alone suffices for the offspring's upbringing, the union is indeterminate, as in the case of dogs and like animals. Now it is evident that the upbringing of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> child requires not only the mother's care for his nourishment, but much more the care of his father as guide and guardian, and under whom he progresses in goods both internal and external. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rebels against an indeterminate union of the sexes and demands that a man should be united to a determinate <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and should abide with her a long time or even for a whole lifetime. Hence it is that in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the male has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of offspring, because on him devolves the upbringing of the child: and this certainly would cease if the union of sexes were indeterminate.

<p>This union with a certain definite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is called <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>; which for the above reason is said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Since, however, the union of the sexes is directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and common goods depend on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for their determination, as stated above (I-II, 90, 2), it follows that this union of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which is called <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, is determined by some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. What this determination is for us will be stated in the Third Part of this work (Supplement,050, seqq.), where we shall treat of the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">sacrament of matrimony</a>. Wherefore, since fornication is an indeterminate union of the sexes, as something incompatible with <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the child's upbringing, and consequently it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Nor does it matter if a man having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by fornication, make sufficient provision for the upbringing of the child: because a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> that comes under the determination of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is judged according to what happens in general, and not according to what may happen in a particular case.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Fornication is reckoned in conjunction with these things, not as being on a par with them in sinfulness, but because the matters mentioned there were equally liable to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> dispute between <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and thus prevent them from agreeing unanimously. For among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, fornication was not deemed unlawful, on account of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: whereas the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, taught by the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, considered it to be unlawful. The other things mentioned were loathsome to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> through custom introduced by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> into their daily life. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a> forbade these things to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, not as though they were unlawful in themselves, but because they were loathsome to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, as stated above (I-II, 103, 4, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Fornication is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it is contrary to right reason. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason is right, in so far as it is ruled by the Divine Will, the first and supreme rule. Wherefore that which a man does by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will and in obedience to His command, is not contrary to right reason, though it may seem contrary to the general order of reason: even so, that which is done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> by the Divine power is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, though it be contrary to the usual course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore just as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in being willing to slay his innocent son, because he obeyed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although considered in itself it was contrary to right <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in general, so, too, Osee <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not in committing fornication by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command. Nor should such a copulation be strictly called fornication, though it be so called in reference to the general course of things. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iii, 8): "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands a thing to be done against the customs or agreement of any people, though it were never done by them heretofore, it is to be done"; and afterwards he adds: "For as among the powers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society, the greater authority is obeyed in preference to the lesser, so must <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in preference to all."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> went in to their handmaidens with no purpose of fornication, as we shall show further on when we treat of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a> (Supplement,065, 5, ad 2). As to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> there is no need to excuse him, for he also <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> to be sold.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Simple fornication is contrary to the love of our neighbor, because it is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the child to be born, as we have shown, since it is an act of generation accomplished in a manner disadvantageous to the future child.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who, while given to works of piety, yields to the inconstancy of the flesh, is freed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> loss, in so far as these works dispose him to receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to repent, and because by such works he makes satisfaction for his past inconstancy; but not so as to be freed by pious works, if he persist in carnal inconstancy impenitent until death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> One copulation may result in the begetting of a man, wherefore inordinate copulation, which hinders the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the future child, is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to the very genus of the act, and not only as to the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. On the other hand, one meal does not hinder the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a man's whole life, wherefore the act of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its genus. It would, however, be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if a man were knowingly to partake of a food which would alter the whole <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of his life, as was the case with <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p>Nor is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that fornication is the least of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> comprised under <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for the marriage act that is done out of sensuous pleasure is a lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether fornication is the most grievous of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that fornication is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For seemingly a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the more grievous according as it proceeds from a greater sensuous pleasure. Now the greatest sensuous pleasure is in fornication, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 7:9</a> says that the "flame of sensuous pleasure is most fierce in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>." Therefore it seems that fornication is the gravest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the more grievous that is committed against a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> more closely united to the sinner: thus he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously who strikes his father than one who strikes a stranger. Now according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>, "He that committeth fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> against his own body," which is most intimately connected with a man. Therefore it seems that fornication is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is, the graver would seem to be the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against it. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication is seemingly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, as appears from what was said in the foregoing Article. It is also against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>, "Shall I . . . take the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and make them the members of a harlot?" Therefore fornication is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiii, 12) that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh are less grievous than <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be measured in two ways, first with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, secondly with regard to some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. The gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is measured with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is determined according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to which that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed. Now fornication is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the child to be born. Wherefore it is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as to its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, than those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are contrary to external goods, such as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> and the like; while it is less grievous than those which are directly against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are injurious to the life of one already born, such as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sensual pleasure that aggravates a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that which is in the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But the sensual pleasure that is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, lessens <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the less grievous according as it is committed under the impulse of a greater passion. It is in this way that the greatest sensual pleasure is in fornication. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christiano [Serm. ccxciii; ccl de Temp.; see Appendix to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> works]) that of all a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> conflicts, the most difficult combats are those of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; wherein the fight is a daily one, but victory rare: and <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> declares (De Summo Bono ii, 39) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is subjected to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> more than by anything else," because, to wit, the vehemence of this passion is more difficult to overcome.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fornicator is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against his own body, not merely because the pleasure of fornication is consummated in the flesh, which is also the case in <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, but also because he acts against the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his own body by an undue resolution and defilement thereof, and an undue association with another. Nor does it follow from this that fornication is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reason is of greater value than the body, wherefore if there be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more opposed to reason, it will be more grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in so far as it is prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> begetting of the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that may be born. Now one who is already an actual member of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> attains to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> more than one who is a man <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentially</a>, and from this point of view <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than fornication and every kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, through being more opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Again, a Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: and therefore those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also that are against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are more grievous. Moreover, fornication is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not directly as though the fornicator intended to offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but consequently, in the same way as all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And just as the members of our body are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> members, so too, our spirit is one with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are more against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> than fornication is.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there can be mortal sin in touches and kisses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in touches and kisses. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ephesians 5:3</a>): "Fornication and all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>," then he adds: "Or obscenity" (which a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> refers to "<a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> and fondling"), "or foolish talking" (as "soft speeches"), "or scurrility" (which "fools call geniality--i.e. jocularity"), and afterwards he continues (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians 5:5</a>): "For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye this and understand that no fornicator, or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, or covetous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (which is the serving of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>), hath inheritance in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," thus making no further mention of obscenity, as neither of foolish talking or scurrility. Therefore these are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, fornication is stated to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as being prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the future child's begetting and upbringing. But these are not affected by kisses and touches or blandishments. Therefore there is no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in these.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things that are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in themselves can never be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> actions. Yet kisses, touches, and the like can be done sometimes without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore they are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in themselves.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> look is less than a touch, a caress or a kiss. But according to <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew 5:28</a>, "Whosoever shall look on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her hath already committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her in his heart." Much more therefore are <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> kisses and other like things mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (Ad Pompon, de Virgin., Ep. lxii), "By their very intercourse, their blandishments, their converse, their embraces, those who are associated in a sleep that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> neither <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> nor shame, acknowledge their disgrace and crime." Therefore by doing these things a man is guilty of a crime, that is, of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be a mortal works. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in two ways. First, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and in this way a kiss, caress, or touch does not, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, imply a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is possible to do such things without <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> pleasure, either as being the custom of one's country, or on account of some <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> or reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Secondly, a thing is said to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: thus he who gives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, in order to lead someone into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mortally on account of his corrupt <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>. Now it has been stated above (I-II, 74, 8), that it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only to consent to the act, but also to the delectation of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore since fornication is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and much more so the other kinds of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, it follows that in such like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not only consent to the act but also consent to the pleasure is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently, when these kisses and caresses are done for this delectation, it follows that they are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and only in this way are they said to be <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a>. Therefore in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a>, they are mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> makes no further mention of these three because they are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> except as directed to those that he had mentioned before.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although kisses and touches do not by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> hinder the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offspring, they proceed from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is the source of this hindrance: and on this account they are mortally <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument proves that such things are not mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether nocturnal pollution is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that nocturnal pollution is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the same things are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and demerit. Now a man may <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> while he sleeps, as was the case with Solomon, who while asleep obtained the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa003.htm#verse5">1 Samuel 3:5</a>). Therefore a man may demerit while asleep; and thus nocturnal pollution would seem to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whoever has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now a man has the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> while asleep, since in our sleep we frequently discuss matters, choose this rather than that, consenting to one thing, or dissenting to another. Therefore one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while asleep, so that nocturnal pollution is not prevented by sleep from being a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seeing that it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> according to its genus.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is useless to reprove and instruct one who cannot act according to or against <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, while asleep, is instructed and reproved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse15">Job 33:15-16</a>, "By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to lay hold of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'When deep sleep falleth upon men.' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is apparently quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, as the passage is given correctly above, 95, 6, Objection 1 . . . Then He openeth the ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn." Therefore a man, while asleep, can act according to or against his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and this is to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> actions, and thus it seems that nocturnal pollution is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15): "When the same image that comes into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of a speaker presents itself to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the sleeper, so that the latter is unable to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> from the real union of bodies, the flesh is at once moved, with the result that usually follows such motions; and yet there is as little <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this as there is in speaking and therefore thinking about such things while one is awake."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nocturnal pollution may be considered in two ways. First, in itself; and thus it has not the character of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since even the first movement of the sensuality has nothing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in it, except in so far as it can be suppressed by reason; wherefore in the absence of reason's judgment, there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in it. Now during sleep reason has not a free judgment. For there is no one who while sleeping does not regard some of the images formed by his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> as though they were real, as stated above in I, 84, 8, ad 2. Wherefore what a man does while he sleeps and is deprived of reason's judgment, is not imputed to him as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as neither are the actions of a maniac or an imbecile.

<p>Secondly, nocturnal pollution may be considered with reference to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. This may be threefold. One is a bodily <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For when there is excess of seminal humor in the body, or when the humor is disintegrated either through overheating of the body or some other disturbance, the sleeper dreams things that are connected with the discharge of this excessive or disintegrated humor: the same thing happens when <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is cumbered with other superfluities, so that phantasms relating to the discharge of those superfluities are formed in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Accordingly if this excess of humor be due to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (for instance excessive eating or drinking), nocturnal pollution has the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: whereas if the excess or disintegration of these superfluities be not due to a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, nocturnal pollution is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, neither in itself nor in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>A second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of nocturnal pollution is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the inner <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for instance when it happens to the sleeper on account of some previous thought. For the thought which preceded while he was awake, is sometimes purely speculative, for instance when one thinks about the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh for the purpose of discussion; while sometimes it is accompanied by a certain emotion either of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> or of abhorrence. Now nocturnal pollution is more apt to arise from thinking about carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> for such pleasures, because this leaves its trace and inclination in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that the sleeper is more easily led in his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> to consent to acts productive of pollution. In this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 13) that "in so far as certain movements in some degree pass" from the waking state to the state of sleep, "the dreams of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men are better than those of any other people": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15) that "even during sleep, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may have conspicuous <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> on account of its <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition." Thus it is evident that nocturnal pollution may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> on the part of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. on the other hand, it may happen that nocturnal pollution ensues after thoughts about carnal acts, though they were speculative, or accompanied by abhorrence, and then it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, neither in itself nor in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and external; for instance when by the work of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the sleeper's phantasms are disturbed so as to induce the aforesaid result. Sometimes this is associated with a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely the neglect to guard against the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Hence the words of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> at even: "Our enemy repress, that so our bodies no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>" [Translation W. K. Blount].

<p>On the other hand, this may occur without any fault on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part, and through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> alone. Thus we read in the Collationes Patrum (Coll. xxii, 6) of a man who was ever wont to suffer from nocturnal pollution on festivals, and that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> brought this about in order to prevent him from receiving Holy Communion. Hence it is manifest that nocturnal pollution is never a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is sometimes the result of a previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Solomon did not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> to receive wisdom from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> while he was asleep. He received it in token of his previous desire. It is for this reason that his petition is stated to have been pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#verse10">1 Kings 3:10</a>), as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is more or less hindered in sleep, according as the inner sensitive powers are more or less overcome by sleep, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or attenuation of the evaporations. Nevertheless it is always hindered somewhat, so as to be unable to elicit a judgment altogether free, as stated in I, 84, 8, ad 2. Therefore what it does then is not imputed to it as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason's</a> apprehension is not hindered during sleep to the same extent as its judgment, for this is accomplished by reason turning to sensible objects, which are the first principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought. Hence nothing hinders <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reason during sleep from apprehending anew something arising out of the traces left by his previous thoughts and phantasms presented to him, or again through Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, or the interference of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether seduction should be reckoned a species of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that seduction should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For seduction denotes the unlawful violation of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, according to the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1) [Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa]. But this may occur between an unmarried <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and an unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which pertains to fornication. Therefore seduction should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, distinct from fornication.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Patriarch. [De <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> i, 4): "Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be deluded by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws: all seduction is <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>." Now a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not contained under another that is differentiated in opposition to it. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, it seems that seduction should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to do a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> an injury would seem to pertain to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> rather than to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Now the seducer does an injury to another, namely the violated <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a>'s father, who "can take the injury as personal to himself" [Gratian, ad can. Lex illa], and sue the seducer for damages. Therefore seduction should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Seduction consists properly in the venereal act whereby a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is violated. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is properly about venereal actions, it would seem that seduction is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> has a special deformity, we must reckon it to be a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> concerned with venereal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, as stated above (Question 153, Article 1). And a special deformity attaches to the violation of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> who is under her father's care: both on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a>, who through being violated without any previous compact of marriage is both hindered from contracting a lawful marriage and is put on the road to a wanton life from which she was withheld lest she should lose the seal of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: and on the part of the father, who is her guardian, according to <a href="../bible/sir042.htm#verse11">Sirach 42:11</a>, "Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest at any time she make thee become a laughing-stock to thy enemies." Therefore it is evident that seduction which denotes the unlawful violation of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, while still under the guardianship of her parents, is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is free from the bond of marriage, she is not free from her father's power. Moreover, the seal of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a special obstacle to the intercourse of fornication, in that it should be removed by marriage only. Hence seduction is not simple fornication, since the latter is intercourse with harlots, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, namely, who are no longer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>, "And have not done penance for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and fornication," etc.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> here takes seduction in another sense, as applicable in a general way to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Wherefore seduction, in the words quoted, signifies the intercourse between a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> other than his wife. This is clear from his adding: "Nor is it lawful for the husband to do what the wife may not." On this sense, too, we are to understand the words of <a href="../bible/num005.htm#verse13">Numbers 5:13</a>: "If [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'But'] the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is secret, and cannot be provided by <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, because she was not found in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> [stupro]."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Nothing prevents a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from having a greater deformity through being united to another <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> obtains a greater deformity from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> would seem to be more inordinate, seeing that it refrains not from the pleasurable object so that it may avoid an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. On fact a twofold <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> attaches to it. One is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, who, though not violated by force, is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a>, and thus the seducer is bound to compensation. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse16">Exodus 22:16-17</a>): "If a man <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduce</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> not yet espoused, and lie with her, he shall endow her and have her to wife. If the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid's</a> father will not give her to him, he shall give money according to the <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dowry</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are wont to receive." The other injury is done to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid's</a> father: wherefore the seducer is bound by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to a penalty in his regard. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse28">Deuteronomy 22:28-29</a>): "If a man find a damsel that is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> come to judgment: he that lay with her shall give to the father of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> fifty sicles of silver, and shall have her to wife, and because he hath <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> her, he may not put her away all the days of his life": and this, lest he should <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> to have <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> her in mockery, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes. [QQ. in Dt., qu. xxxiv.]

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether rape is a species of lust, distinct from seduction?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that rape is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, distinct from seduction. For <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. v, 26) that "seduction [stuprum], or rape, properly speaking, is unlawful intercourse, and takes its name from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> corruption: wherefore he that is guilty of rape is a seducer." Therefore it seems that rape should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> distinct from seduction.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, rape, apparently, implies <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. For it is stated in the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1 [Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa]) that "rape is committed when a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> is taken away by force from her father's house that after being violated she may be taken to wife." But the employment of force is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> regards the pleasure of intercourse. Therefore it seems that rape should not be reckoned a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is curbed by marriage: for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>): "For fear of fornication, let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have his own wife." Now rape is an obstacle to subsequent marriage, for it was enacted in the council of Meaux: "We decree that those who are guilty of rape, or of abducting or seducing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, should not have those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in marriage, although they should have subsequently <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> them with the consent of their parents." Therefore rape is not a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> distinct from seduction.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a man may have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his newly <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> wife without committing a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Yet he may commit rape if he take her away by force from her parents' house, and have carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her. Therefore rape should not be reckoned a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Rape is unlawful sexual intercourse, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states (Etym. v, 26). But this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore rape is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Rape, in the sense in which we speak of it now, is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: and sometimes it coincides with seduction; sometimes there is rape without seduction, and sometimes seduction without rape.

<p>They coincide when a man employs force in order unlawfully to violate a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. This force is employed sometimes both towards the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and towards her father; and sometimes towards the father and not to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, for instance if she allows herself to be taken away by force from her father's house. Again, the force employed in rape differs in another way, because sometimes a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> is taken away by force from her parents' house, and is forcibly violated: while sometimes, though taken away by force, she is not forcibly violated, but of her own consent, whether by act of fornication or by the act of marriage: for the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of rape remain no matter how force is employed. There is rape without seduction if a man abduct a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> or one who is not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Hence Pope Symmachus says [Ep. v ad Caesarium; Cf. can. Raptores xxxvi, qu. 2, "We abhor abductors whether of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> or of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> on account of the heinousness of their crime."

<p>There is seduction without rape when a man, without employing force, violates a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> unlawfully.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since rape frequently coincides with seduction, the one is sometimes used to signify the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The employment of force would seem to arise from the greatness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, the result being that a man does not fear to endanger himself by offering <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The rape of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> who is promised in marriage is to be judged differently from that of one who is not so promised. For one who is promised in marriage must be restored to her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, who has a right to her in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>: whereas one that is not promised to another must first of all be restored to her father's care, and then the abductor may lawfully marry her with her parents' consent. Otherwise the marriage is unlawful, since whosoever steals a thing he is bound to restore it. Nevertheless rape does not dissolve a marriage already contracted, although it is an impediment to its being contracted. As to the decree of the council in question, it was made in abhorrence of this crime, and has been abrogated. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [The quotation is from Can. Tria. xxxvi, qu. 2 declares the contrary: "Three kinds of lawful marriage," says he, "are mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. The first is that of a chaste <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> given away lawfully in her maidenhood to a man. The second is when a man finds a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> in the city, and by force has carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her. If the father be willing, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall endow her according to the father's estimate, and shall pay the price of her purity [Cf. <a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy 22:23-29</a>. The third is, when the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> is taken away from such a man, and is given to another at the father's will."

<p>We may also take this decree to refer to those who are promised to others in marriage, especially if the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> be expressed by words in the present tense.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is just <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> has, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, a certain right in her: wherefore, although he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by using <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, he is not guilty of the crime of rape. Hence <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> says [Can. Lex illa, xxvii, qu. 2; xxxvi, qu. 1]: "This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of bygone rulers stated that rape was committed when a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a>, with regard to whose marriage nothing had so far been decided, was taken away by force."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether adultery is determinate species of lust, distinct from the other species?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, distinct from the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> takes its name from a man having intercourse "with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not his own [ad alteram]," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>: Serm. li, 13 de Divers. lxiii] on <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse14">Exodus 20:14</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not one's own may be of various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, namely either a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or under her father's care, or a harlot, or of any other description. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> distinct from the others.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Contra Jovin. i]: "It matters not for what reason a man behaves as one demented. Hence Sixtus the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> says in his Maxims: He that is insatiable of his wife is an adulterer," and in like manner one who is over enamored of any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Now every kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> includes a too ardent love. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is in every kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: and consequently it should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, where there is the same kind of deformity, there would seem to be the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, apparently, there is the same kind of deformity in seduction and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: since in either case a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is violated who is under another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> authority. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, distinct from the others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Pope Leo [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De Bono Conjug. iv; Cf. Append. Grat. ad can. Ille autem. xxxii, qu. 5 says that "<a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is sexual intercourse with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in contravention of the marriage compact, whether through the impulse of one's own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or with the consent of the other party." Now this implies a special deformity of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Adultery, as its name implies, "is access to another's marriage-bed [ad alienum torum]" [Cf. Append. Gratian, ad can. Ille autem. xxxii, qu. 1. By so doing a man is guilty of a twofold offense against <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> procreation. First, by accession to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is not joined to him in marriage, which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the upbringing of his own children. Secondly, by accession to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is united to another in marriage, and thus he hinders the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of another's children. The same applies to the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is corrupted by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir023.htm#verse32">Sirach 23:32-33</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> . . . that leaveth her husband . . . shall be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For first she hath been unfaithful to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Most High" (since there it is commanded: "Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>"); "and secondly, she hath offended against her husband," by making it uncertain that the children are his: "thirdly, she hath fornicated in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and hath gotten children of another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of her offspring. The first of these, however, is common to all mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while the two others belong especially to the deformity of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Hence it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, through having a special deformity in venereal acts.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Matrimony is specially ordained for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offspring, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is specially opposed to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">matrimony</a>, in the point of breaking the marriage <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is due between husband and wife. And since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is too ardent a lover of his wife acts counter to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage if he use her indecently, although he be not unfaithful, he may in a sense be called an adulterer; and even more so than he that is too ardent a lover of another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The wife is under her husband's authority, as united to him in marriage: whereas the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maid</a> is under her father's authority, as one who is to be <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> by that authority. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of marriage in one way, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of seduction in another; wherefore they are reckoned to differ specifically.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether incest is a determinate species of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is not a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> ['Incestus' is equivalent to 'in-castus = 'unchaste'] takes its name from being a privation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. But all kinds of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are opposed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> itself in general.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is stated in the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1 [Cf. Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa]) that "<a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is intercourse between a man and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity." Now affinity differs from <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>. Therefore it is not one but several <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that which does not, of itself, imply a deformity, does not constitute a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But intercourse between those who are related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity does not, of itself, contain any deformity, else it would never have been lawful. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is not a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are distinguished according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with whom a man has unlawful intercourse. Now <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> implies a special <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, because it is unlawful intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity as stated (Objection 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A1,6) wherever we find something incompatible with the right use of venereal actions, there must needs be a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Now sexual intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or affinity is unbecoming to venereal union on three counts. First, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> owes a certain respect to his parents and therefore to his other blood relations, who are descended in near degree from the same parents: so much so indeed that among the ancients, as Valerius Maximus relates [Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1, it was not deemed right for a son to bathe with his father, lest they should see one another naked. Now from what has been said (142, 4; 151, 4), it is evident that in venereal acts there is a certain shamefulness inconsistent with respect, wherefore men are ashamed of them. Wherefore it is unseemly that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be united in venereal intercourse. This reason seems to be indicated (<a href="../bible/lev018.htm#verse7">Leviticus 18:7</a>) where we read: "She is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness," and the same is expressed further on with regard to others.

<p>The second reason is because blood relations must needs live in close touch with one another. Wherefore if they were not debarred from venereal union, opportunities of venereal intercourse would be very frequent and thus men's minds would be enervated by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Hence in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> [<a href="../bible/lev018.htm">Leviticus 18</a>] the prohibition was apparently directed specially to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who must needs live together.

<p>The third reason is, because this would hinder a man from having many friends: since through a man taking a stranger to wife, all his wife's relations are united to him by a special kind of friendship, as though they were of the same blood as himself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16): "The demands of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> are most perfectly satisfied by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> uniting together in the bonds that the various ties of friendship require, so that they may live together in a useful and becoming amity; nor should one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have many relationships in one, but each should have one."

<p><a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> adds another reason (2 Polit. ii): for since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> that a man should have a liking for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of his kindred, if to this be added the love that has its origin in venereal intercourse, his love would be too ardent and would become a very great incentive to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: and this is contrary to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Unlawful intercourse between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> related to one another would be most prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, both on account of the opportunities it affords, and because of the excessive ardor of love, as stated in the Article. Wherefore the unlawful intercourse between such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is called "<a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>" antonomastically.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Persons are related by affinity through one who is related by <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>: and therefore since the one depends on the other, <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and affinity entail the same kind of unbecomingness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is something <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> unbecoming and contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in sexual intercourse between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> related by blood, for instance between parents and children who are directly and immediately related to one another, since children <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> owe their parents <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> instances a horse (De Animal. ix, 47) which covered its own mother by mistake and threw itself over a precipice as though horrified at what it had done, because some animals even have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> respect for those that have begotten them. There is not the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> unbecomingness attaching to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are related to one another not directly but through their parents: and, as to this, becomingness or unbecomingness varies according to custom, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>: because, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), sexual intercourse, being directed to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is subject to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16), whereas the union of brothers and sisters goes back to olden times, it became all the more worthy of condemnation when religion forbade it.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether sacrilege can be a species of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> cannot be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not contained under different genera that are not subalternated to one another. Now <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of irreligion, as stated above (Question 99, Article 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> cannot be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1 [Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa]), do not place <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> among other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are reckoned <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore it would seem not to be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, something derogatory to a sacred thing may be done by the other kinds of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as well as by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. But <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is not reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, or of any other similar <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore neither should it be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16) that "if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, to go beyond one's earthly bounds, how much more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is it through venereal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> to transgress the bounds of morals!" Now to go beyond one's earthly bounds in sacred matters is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. Therefore it is likewise a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> to overthrow the bounds of morals through venereal desire in sacred matters. But venereal desire pertains to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 18, 6,7), the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, that is directed to the end of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, assumes the latter's <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: thus, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a> committed for the sake of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, passes into the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Now it is evident that as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Virgin. 8), the observance of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, by being directed to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, becomes an act of religion, as in the case of those who <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> and keep <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Wherefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> also, by violating something pertaining to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>: and in this way <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> may be accounted a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lust, by being directed to another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> as its end, becomes a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: and so a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> may be also a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of irreligion, as of a higher genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The enumeration referred to, includes those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: whereas <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> in so far as it is directed to another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> as its end, and may coincide with the various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For unlawful intercourse between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> mutually united by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> relationship, is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> after the manner of incest. Intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as she is the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> resembling <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> be under her father's authority, it will be <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> seduction; and if force be employed it will be <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rape, which kind of rape even the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> punishes more severely than others. Thus the Emperor Justinian says [Cod. i, iii de Episc. et Cler. 5: "If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dare, I will not say to rape, but even to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> with a view to marriage, he shall be liable to capital punishment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Sacrilege is committed on a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> thing. Now a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> thing is either a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who is desired for sexual intercourse, and thus it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or it is desired for possession, and thus it is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Sacrilege may also come under the head of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for instance, if through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> an injury be done to a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Again, one may commit a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> by partaking gluttonously of sacred food. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is ascribed more specially to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> for the observance of which certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are specially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether the unnatural vice is a species of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For no mention of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is made in the enumeration given above (1, Objection 1). Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and so it is comprised under <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is comprised not under <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but under bestiality, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 5). Therefore the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> regards acts directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, as stated above (Question 153, Article 2): Whereas the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> concerns acts from which generation cannot follow. Therefore the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is reckoned together with the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>) where we read: "And have not done penance for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, and fornication, and lasciviousness," where a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Lasciviousness, i.e., unnatural <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A6,9) wherever there occurs a special kind of deformity whereby the venereal act is rendered unbecoming, there is a determinate <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. This may occur in two ways: First, through being contrary to right reason, and this is common to all <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; secondly, because, in addition, it is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order of the venereal act as becoming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>: and this is called "the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>." This may happen in several ways. First, by procuring pollution, without any copulation, for the sake of venereal pleasure: this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of "<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>" which some call "effeminacy." Secondly, by copulation with a thing of undue <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and this is called "bestiality." Thirdly, by copulation with an undue sex, male with male, or female with female, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse27">Romans 1:27</a>): and this is called the "<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of sodomy." Fourthly, by not observing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> manner of copulation, either as to undue means, or as to other monstrous and bestial manners of copulation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> There we enumerated the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that are not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: wherefore the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> was omitted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Bestiality differs from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, for the latter is opposed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by a certain excess in the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and therefore is reducible to the same genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> intends not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation but venereal pleasures. It is possible to have this without those acts from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation follows: and it is that which is sought in the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether the unnatural vice is the greatest sin among the species of lust?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For the more a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> the graver it is. Now <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, seduction and rape which are injurious to our neighbor are seemingly more contrary to the love of our neighbor, than unnatural <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by which no other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is injured. Therefore the unnatural <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the greatest among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would seem to be the most grievous. Now <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is committed directly against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is injurious to the Divine worship. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, seemingly, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is all the more grievous according as we owe a greater love to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> against whom that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> requires that a man love more those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are united to him--and such are those whom he defiles by <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>--than <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not connected with him, and whom in certain cases he defiles by the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, if the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is most grievous, the more it is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the graver it would seem to be. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> or effeminacy would seem to be most contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it would seem especially in accord with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that agent and patient should be distinct from one another. Hence it would follow that <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is the gravest of unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are not the most grievous among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De adult. conjug. [The quotation is from Cap. Adulterii xxxii, qu. 7. Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, De Bono Conjugali, viii.]) that "of all these," namely the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, "that which is against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the worst."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In every genus, worst of all is the corruption of the principle on which the rest depend. Now the principles of reason are those things that are according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because reason presupposes things as determined by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, before disposing of other things according as it is fitting. This may be observed both in speculative and in practical matters. Wherefore just as in speculative matters the most grievous and shameful <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is that which is about things the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so in matters of action it is most grave and shameful to act against things as determined by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, since by the unnatural <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> transgresses that which has been determined by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with regard to the use of venereal actions, it follows that in this matter this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is gravest of all. After it comes <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incest</a>, which, as stated above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>), is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> respect which we owe <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> related to us.

<p>With regard to the other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> they imply a transgression merely of that which is determined by right reason, on the presupposition, however, of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles. Now it is more against reason to make use of the venereal act not only with prejudice to the future offspring, but also so as to injure another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> besides. Wherefore simple fornication, which is committed without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is the least grave among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Then, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to have intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is subject to another's authority as regards the act of generation, than as regards merely her guardianship. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is more grievous than seduction. And both of these are aggravated by the use of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Hence rape of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is graver than seduction, and rape of a wife than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. And all these are aggravated by coming under the head of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, as stated above (10, ad 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as the ordering of right reason proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself: wherefore in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereby the very order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is violated, an injury is done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Author of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iii, 8): "Those foul offenses that are against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be everywhere and at all times detested and punished, such as were those of the people of Sodom, which should all nations commit, they should all stand guilty of the same crime, by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which hath not so made men that they should so abuse one another. For even that very intercourse which should be between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and us is violated, when that same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of which He is the Author, is polluted by the perversity of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Vices against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are also against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (ad 1), and are so much more grievous than the depravity of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, as the order impressed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is prior to and more firm than any subsequently established order.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is more intimately united to each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, than any other <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> is. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are more grievous.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends more on the abuse of a thing than on the omission of the right use. Wherefore among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the lowest place belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, which consists in the mere omission of copulation with another. While the most grievous is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of bestiality, because use of the due <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is not observed. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse2">Genesis 37:2</a>, "He accused his brethren of a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> crime," says that "they copulated with cattle." After this comes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of sodomy, because use of the right sex is not observed. Lastly comes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of not observing the right manner of copulation, which is more grievous if the abuse regards the "vas" than if it affects the manner of copulation in respect of other circumstances.
