<h1>Question 155. Continence</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether continence is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and genus are not co-ordinate members of the same division. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is co-ordinated with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 1,9). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by using a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19), "a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a thing that no one makes ill use of." Yet one may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by containing oneself: for instance, if one desire to do a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and contain oneself from doing it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> withdraws <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from that which is lawful, but only from unlawful things: for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse23">Galatians 5:23</a>, "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, modesty," etc., says that by <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> a man refrains even from things that are lawful. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> would seem to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now such is <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, for Andronicus says [De Affectibus] that "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> unconquered by pleasure." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The word "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>" is taken by various people in two ways. For some understand <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> to denote abstention from all venereal pleasure: thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> joins <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse23">Galatians 5:23</a>). On this sense perfect <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in the first place, and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> in the second. Wherefore the same applies to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> understood thus, as to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which we have stated above (Question 152, Article 3) to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Others, however, understand <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> as signifying that whereby a man resists <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, which in him are vehement. On this sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> takes <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> (Ethic. vii, 7), and thus also it is used in the Conferences of the Fathers (Collat. xii, 10,11). In this way <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> has something of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far, to wit, as the reason stands firm in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, lest it be led astray by them: yet it does not attain to the perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by which even the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to reason so that vehement <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> do not arise in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 9) that "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but a mixture," inasmuch as it has something of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and somewhat falls short of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>If, however, we take <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in a broad sense, for any principle of commendable actions, we may say that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> includes <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in the same division with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in so far as the former falls short of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is that which is according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore from the very fact that a man holds [tenet se] to that which is in accord with reason, he is said to contain himself. Now whatever pertains to perversion of reason is not according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence he alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said to be continent who stands to that which is in accord with right reason, and not to that which is in accord with perverse reason. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires are opposed to right reason, even as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desires are opposed to perverse reason. Wherefore he is properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> continent who holds to right reason, by abstaining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, and not he who holds to perverse reason, by abstaining from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desires: indeed, the latter should rather be said to be obstinate in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> quoted takes <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in the first sense, as denoting a perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which refrains not merely from unlawful goods, but also from certain lawful things that are lesser goods, in order to give its whole attention to the more perfect goods.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether desires for pleasures of touch are the matter of continence?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that desires for pleasures of touch are not the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of continence. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 46): "General decorum by its consistent form and the perfection of what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is restrained* in its every action." ["Continentem" according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>' reading; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> wrote "concinentem = harmonious"].

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> takes its name from a man standing for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of right reason, as stated above (1, ad 2). Now other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> lead men astray from right reason with greater vehemence than the desire for pleasures of touch: for instance, the fear of mortal dangers, which stupefies a man, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which makes him behave like a madman, as Seneca remarks [De Ira i, 1]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> does not properly regard the desires for pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54): "It is <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> that restrains cupidity with the guiding hand of counsel." Now cupidity is generally used to denote the desire for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> rather than the desire for pleasures of touch, according to <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, "Cupidity [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'The desire of money'] (<em>philargyria</em>), is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not properly about the desires for pleasures of touch

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, there are pleasures of touch not only in venereal matters but also in eating. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is wont to be applied only to the use of venereal matters. Therefore the desire for pleasures of touch is not its proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, among pleasures of touch some are not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> but bestial, both as regards food--for instance, the pleasure of eating <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh; and as regards venereal matters--for instance the abuse of animals or boys. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not about such like things, as stated in Ethic. vii, 5. Therefore desires for pleasures of touch are not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence are about the same things as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance." Now <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and intemperance are about the desires for pleasures of touch, as stated above (Question 141, Article 4). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence are also about that same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Continence denotes, by its very name, a certain curbing, in so far as a man contains himself from following his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is properly said in reference to those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which urge a man towards the pursuit of something, wherein it is praiseworthy that reason should withhold <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from pursuing: whereas it is not properly about those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, such as fear and the like, which denote some kind of withdrawal: since in these it is praiseworthy to remain firm in pursuing what reason dictates, as stated above (123, 3,4). Now it is to be observed that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> inclinations are the principles of all supervening inclinations, as stated above (I, 60, 2). Wherefore the more they follow the inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the more strongly do the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> urge to the pursuance of an object. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines chiefly to those things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to it, whether for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, such as food, or for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as venereal acts, the pleasures of which pertain to the touch. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence refer properly to desires for pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> may be used in a general sense in connection with any <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; but is properly applied to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein it is best for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be curbed: so, too, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> properly speaking regards that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> wherein it is best and most difficult to contain oneself, namely desires for pleasures of touch, and yet in a general sense and relatively may be applied to any other <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Properly speaking we do not speak of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in relation to fear, but rather of firmness of mind which <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> implies. As to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it begets an impulse to the pursuit of something, but this impulse follows an apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>--in so far as a man apprehends that someone has injured him--rather than an inclination of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore a man may be said to be continent of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, relatively but not simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> External goods, such as honors, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and the like, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 4), seem to be objects of choice in themselves indeed, but not as being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Wherefore in reference to such things we speak of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as being continent or incontinent, not simply, but relatively, by adding that they are continent or incontinent in regard to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and so forth. Hence Tully either understood <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> in a general sense, as including relative <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, or understood cupidity in a restricted sense as denoting desire for pleasures of touch.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Venereal pleasures are more vehement than pleasures of the palate: wherefore we are wont to speak of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence in reference to venereal matters rather than in reference to food; although according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> they are applicable to both.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Continence is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore it regards those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which can be connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 5) that "if a man were to lay hold of a child with desire of eating him or of satisfying an unnatural passion whether he follow up his desire or not, he is said to be continent [See 4, not absolutely, but relatively."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the subject of continence is the concupiscible power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the subject of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. For the subject of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, as stated (2), is desires for the pleasures of touch, which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Opposites are referred to one same thing" [Categ. viii]. But incontinence is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> overcome reason, for Andronicus says [De Affectibus] that "incontinence is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclination of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, by following which it chooses <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> pleasures in disobedience to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is likewise in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the subject of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either the reason, or the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which is divided into the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and the irascible. Now <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not in the reason, for then it would be an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; nor is it in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, since <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; nor again is it in the irascible, because it is not properly about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the irascible, as stated above (2, ad 2). Therefore it follows that it is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> residing in a certain power removes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act of that power. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> does not remove the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act of the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>: since "the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires," according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 9). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> while residing in a subject, makes that subject have a different disposition from that which it has while subjected to the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> has the same disposition in one who is continent and in one who is incontinent, since in both of them it breaks out into vehement <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. Wherefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> as its subject. Again the reason has the same disposition in both, since both the continent and the incontinent have right reason, and each of them, while undisturbed by passion, purposes not to follow his unlawful desires. Now the primary difference between them is to be found in their choice: since the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though subject to vehement desires, chooses not to follow them, because of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; whereas the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chooses to follow them, although his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> forbids. Hence <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> must needs reside in that power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose act it is to choose; and that is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (I-II, 13, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Continence has for its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> the desires for pleasures of touch, not as moderating them (this belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>), but its business with them is to resist them. For this reason it must be in another power, since resistance is of one thing against another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The will stands between reason and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, and may be moved by either. On the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it is moved by the reason, in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> it is moved by the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> may be ascribed to the reason as to its first mover, and incontinence to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power: though both belong immediately to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as their proper subject.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as their subject, yet it is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to resist them: thus it is that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> resists desires.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether continence is better than temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is better than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir026.htm#verse20">Sirach 26:20</a>): "No price is worthy of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> can be equalled to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the reward a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, the greater the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> apparently <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> the greater reward; for it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>): "He . . . is not crowned, except he strive lawfully," and the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since he is subject to vehement <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, strives more than the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in whom these things are not vehement. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is a more excellent power than the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. But <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) and Andronicus [De Affectibus] reckon <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> to be annexed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> has a twofold signification. On one way it denotes cessation from all venereal pleasures; and if <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> be taken in this sense, it is greater than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> considered absolutely, as may be gathered from what we said above (Question 152, Article 5) concerning the preeminence of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> over <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> considered absolutely. On another way <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> may be taken as denoting the resistance of the reason to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires when they are vehement in a man: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is far greater than <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives its praise from that which is in accord with reason. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason flourishes more in the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than in the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because in the former even the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is obedient to reason, being tamed by reason so to speak, whereas in the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> strongly resists reason by its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. Hence <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> is compared to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as the imperfect to the perfect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted may be understood in two ways. First in reference to the sense in which <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> denotes abstinence from all things venereal: and thus it means that "no price is worthy of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," in the genus of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> the fruitfulness of the flesh is the purpose of marriage is equalled to the <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> or of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, as stated above (152, 4,5). Secondly it may be understood in reference to the general sense in which <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> denotes any abstinence from things unlawful: and thus it means that "no price is worthy of a continent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," because its value is not measured with gold or silver, which are appreciable according to weight.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The strength or weakness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> may proceed from two <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. For sometimes it is owing to a bodily <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: because some people by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> temperament are more prone to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> than others; and again opportunities for pleasure which inflame the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> are nearer to hand for some people than for others. Such like weakness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> diminishes <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, whereas strength of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> increases it. on the other hand, weakness or strength of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> arises from a praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for instance the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, or the strength of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as in the case of a temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. On this way weakness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, by reason of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, increases <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, whereas strength of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> diminishes it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is more akin to the reason than the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power is. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason--on account of which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is praised by the very fact that it reaches not only to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but also to the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, as happens in the temperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--is shown to be greater than if it reach only to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as in the case of one who is continent.
