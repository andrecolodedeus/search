<h1>Question 156. Incontinence</h1>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether incontinence pertains to the soul or to the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that incontinence pertains not to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but to the body. For sexual diversity comes not from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but from the body. Now sexual diversity <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> diversity of incontinence: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 5) that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not described either as continent or as incontinent. Therefore incontinence pertains not to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but to the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not result from the temperament of the body. But incontinence results from the bodily temperament: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "it is especially people of a quick or choleric and atrabilious temper whose incontinence is one of unbridled desire." Therefore incontinence regards the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, victory concerns the victor rather than the vanquished. Now a man is said to be incontinent, because "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit," and overcomes it. Therefore incontinence pertains to the flesh rather than to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Man differs from beast chiefly as regards the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now they differ in respect of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> and incontinence, for we ascribe neither <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> nor incontinence to the beasts, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, 3). Therefore incontinence is chiefly on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things are ascribed to their direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> rather than to those which merely occasion them. Now that which is on the part of the body is merely an occasional <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of incontinence; since it is owing to a bodily disposition that vehement <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> can arise in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is a power of the organic body. Yet these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, however vehement they be, are not the sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of incontinence, but are merely the occasion thereof, since, so long as the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> remains, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is always able to resist his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> gain such strength as to take away the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> altogether--as in the case of those who become insane through the vehemence of their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>--the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> or incontinence cease, because such people do not retain the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which the continent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> follows and the incontinent forsakes. From this it follows that the direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of incontinence is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which fails to resist a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> by the reason. This happens in two ways, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 7): first, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> yields to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, before the reason has given its counsel; and this is called "unbridled incontinence" or "impetuosity": secondly, when a man does not stand to what has been counselled, through holding weakly to reason's judgment; wherefore this kind of incontinence is called "weakness." Hence it is manifest that incontinence pertains chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body, and has certain powers which make use of bodily organs. The operations of these organs conduce somewhat to those operations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which are accomplished without bodily instruments, namely to the acts of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> receives from the senses, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is urged by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Accordingly, since <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as regards the body, has a weak temperament, the result is that for the most part, whatever she holds to, she holds to it weakly; although in rare cases the opposite occurs, according to <a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse10">Proverbs 31:10</a>, "Who shall find a valiant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?" And since small and weak things "are accounted as though they were not" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Phys. ii, 5 the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as though they had not the firm judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, although the contrary happens in some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Hence he states that "we do not describe <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as being continent, because they are vacillating" through being unstable of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and "are easily led" so that they follow their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> readily.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is owing to the impulse of passion that a man at once follows his passion before his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> counsels him. Now the impulse of passion may arise either from its quickness, as in bilious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> [Cf. I-II, 46, 5], or from its vehemence, as in the melancholic, who on account of their earthy temperament are most vehemently aroused. Even so, on the other hand, a man fails to stand to that which is counselled, because he holds to it in weakly fashion by reason of the softness of his temperament, as we have stated with regard to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (ad 1). This is also the case with phlegmatic temperaments, for the same reason as in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And these results are due to the fact that the bodily temperament is an occasional but not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of incontinence, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh overcomes the spirit, not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, but through a certain negligence of the spirit in not resisting strongly.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether incontinence is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that incontinence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18): "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid." Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can by himself avoid incontinence, according to <a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse21">Wisdom 8:21</a>, "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>'] that I could not . . . be continent, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave it." Therefore incontinence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, apparently every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> originates in the reason. But the judgment of reason is overcome in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore incontinence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vehemently. Now a man becomes incontinent through the vehemence of divine love: for <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, through incontinence of divine love, exclaimed: I live, now not I" (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians 2:20</a>). Therefore incontinence is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is numbered together with other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse3">2 Timothy 3:3</a>) where it is written: "Slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful," etc. Therefore incontinence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Incontinence about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> may be considered in two ways. First it may be considered properly and simply: and thus incontinence is about <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of pleasures of touch, even as intemperance is, as we have said in reference to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> (155, 2). On this way incontinence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for two reasons: first, because the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> goes astray from that which is in accord with reason; secondly, because he plunges into shameful pleasures. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 4) that "incontinence is censurable not only because it is wrong"--that is, by straying from reason--"but also because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>"--that is, by following <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. Secondly, incontinence about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is considered, properly--inasmuch as it is a straying from reason--but not simply; for instance when a man does not observe the mode of reason in his desire for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and so forth, which seem to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in themselves. About such things there is incontinence, not simply but relatively, even as we have said above in reference to <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a> (155, 2, ad 3). On this way incontinence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not from the fact that one gives way to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires, but because one fails to observe the mode of reason even in the desire for things that are of themselves desirable.

<p>Thirdly, incontinence is said to be about a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, not properly, but metaphorically. for instance about the desires for things of which one cannot make an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use, such as the desire for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be said to be incontinent in these matters metaphorically, because just as the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is entirely led by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, even so is a man entirely led by his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> desire which is in accord with reason. Such like incontinence is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but pertains to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Man can avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet not without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John 15:5</a>: "Without Me you can do nothing." Wherefore the fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help in order to be continent, does not show incontinence to be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3, "what we can do by means of a friend we do, in a way, ourselves."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The judgment of reason is overcome in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a>, for then he would commit no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but through a certain negligence on account of his not standing firm in resisting the passion by holding to the judgment formed by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument takes incontinence metaphorically and not properly.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the incontinent man sins more gravely than the intemperate?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the intemperate. For, seemingly, the more a man acts against his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the more gravely he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke 12:47</a>, "That servant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord . . . and did not . . . shall be beaten with many stripes." Now the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would seem to act against his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> more than the intemperate because, according to Ethic. vii, 3, the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are the things he desires, nevertheless acts through passion, whereas the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judges what he desires to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the intemperate.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, apparently, the graver a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, the more incurable it is: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, being most grave, are declared to be unpardonable. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of incontinence would appear to be more incurable than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of intemperance. For a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is cured by admonishment and correction, which seemingly are no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he is doing wrong, and does wrong notwithstanding: whereas it seems to the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he is doing well, so that it were <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him to be admonished. Therefore it would appear that the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the intemperate.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more eagerly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the more grievous his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the incontinent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more eagerly than the intemperate, since the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has vehement <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and desires, which the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not always have. Therefore the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the intemperate.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Impenitence aggravates every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom. serm. xi, 12,13) that "impenitence is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. vii, 8) "the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not inclined to be penitent, for he holds on to his choice: but every incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inclined to repentance." Therefore the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more gravely than the incontinent.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [De Duab. Anim. x, xi] <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is chiefly an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, because "by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and live aright" [Retract. i, 9]. Consequently where there is a greater inclination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now in the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in virtue of its own choice, which proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> acquired through custom: whereas in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is inclined to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. And since passion soon passes, whereas a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is "a disposition difficult to remove," the result is that the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> repents at once, as soon as the passion has passed; but not so the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; in fact he rejoices in having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act has become connatural to him by reason of his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Wherefore in reference to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> it is written (<a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse14">Proverbs 2:14</a>) that "they are glad when they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rejoice in most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things." Hence it follows that "the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is much worse than the incontinent," as also the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. vii, 7).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> sometimes precedes the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it, and then the greater the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the more does it diminish or entirely excuse the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it renders it involuntary. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the reason sometimes follows the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and then such like <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the greater it is, the graver the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is shown thereby to be greater. Now in both the incontinent and the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> arises from the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being inclined to something, either by passion, as in the incontinent, or by <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as in the intemperate. Nevertheless greater <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> results thus in the intemperate than in the incontinent. On one respect as regards duration, since in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> lasts only while the passion endures, just as an attack of intermittent fever lasts as long as the humor is disturbed: whereas the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endures without ceasing, on account of the endurance of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, wherefore it is likened to phthisis or any chronic disease, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 8). On another respect the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is greater as regards the thing ignored. For the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> regards some particular detail of choice (in so far as he deems that he must choose this particular thing now): whereas the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is about the end itself, inasmuch as he judges this thing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in order that he may follow his desires without being curbed. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7,8) that "the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is better than the intemperate, because he retains the best principle [<em>To beltiston, e arche</em>, 'the best thing, i.e. the principle']," to wit, the right estimate of the end.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Mere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not suffice to cure the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for he needs the inward assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which quenches <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, besides the application of the external remedy of admonishment and correction, which induce him to begin to resist his desires, so that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is weakened, as stated above (Question 142, Article 2). By these same means the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can be cured. But his curing is more difficult, for two reasons. The first is on the part of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is corrupt as regards the estimate of the last end, which holds the same position as the principle in demonstrations. Now it is more difficult to bring back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> as to the principle; and it is the same in practical matters with one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in regard to the end. The other reason is on the part of the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: for in the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> this proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, which is difficult to remove, whereas the inclination of the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, which is more easily suppressed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The eagerness of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which increases a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is greater in the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than in the incontinent, as explained above. But the eagerness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is sometimes greater in the incontinent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except through vehement <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, whereas the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even through slight <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and sometimes forestalls it. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7) that we blame more the intemperate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "because he pursues pleasure without desiring it or with calm," i.e. slight desire. "For what would he have done if he had desired it with passion?"

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the incontinent in anger is worse than the incontinent in desire?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the incontinent in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is worse than the incontinent in desire. For the more difficult it is to resist the passion, the less grievous, apparently is incontinence: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7): "It is not wonderful, indeed it is pardonable if a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is overcome by strong and overwhelming pleasures or pains." Now, "as Heraclitus says, it is more difficult to resist desire than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>" [Ethic. ii. 3. Therefore incontinence of desire is less grievous than incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one is altogether excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if the passion be so vehement as to deprive one of the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as in the case of one who becomes demented through passion. Now he that is incontinent in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> retains more of the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, than one who is incontinent in desire: since "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> listens to reason somewhat, but desire does not" as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. vii, 6). Therefore the incontinent in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is worse than the incontinent in desire.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the more dangerous a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the more grievous it is. Now incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> would seem to be more dangerous, since it leads a man to a greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, for this is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, to which incontinence of desire leads. Therefore incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is graver than incontinence of desire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is less disgraceful than incontinence of desire."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of incontinence may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the passion which occasions the downfall of reason. In this way incontinence of desire is worse than incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because the movement of desire is more inordinate than the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. There are four reasons for this, and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> indicates them, Ethic. vii, 6: First, because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> partakes somewhat of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tends to avenge the injury done to him, and reason dictates this in a certain degree. Yet he does not tend thereto perfectly, because he does not intend the due mode of vengeance. on the other hand, the movement of desire is altogether in accord with sense and nowise in accord with reason. Secondly, because the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> results more from the bodily temperament owing to the quickness of the movement of the bile which tends to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Hence one who by bodily temperament is disposed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more readily <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> than one who is disposed to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is liable to be concupiscent: wherefore also it happens more often that the children of those who are disposed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are themselves disposed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, than that the children of those who are disposed to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> are also disposed to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Now that which results from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition of the body is deemed more deserving of pardon. Thirdly, because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> seeks to work openly, whereas <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is fain to disguise itself and creeps in by stealth. Fourthly, because he who is subject to <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> works with pleasure, whereas the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> works as though forced by a certain previous displeasure.

<p>Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of incontinence may be considered with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> into which one falls through forsaking reason; and thus incontinence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is, for the most part, more grievous, because it leads to things that are harmful to one's neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is more difficult to resist pleasure perseveringly than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> is enduring. But for the moment it is more difficult to resist <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, on account of its impetuousness.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Concupiscence is stated to be without reason, not as though it destroyed altogether the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but because nowise does it follow the judgment of reason: and for this reason it is more disgraceful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers incontinence with regard to its result.
