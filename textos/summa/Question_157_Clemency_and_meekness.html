<h1>Question 157. Clemency and meekness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3157.htm#article1"> Are clemency and meekness altogether identical?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3157.htm#article2"> Is each of them a virtue?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3157.htm#article3"> Is each a part of temperance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3157.htm#article4"> Their comparison with the other virtues</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether clemency and meekness are absolutely the same?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that clemency and meekness are absolutely the same. For meekness moderates <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5). Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is "desire of vengeance" [Aristotle, Rhet. ii, 2]. Since, then, clemency "is leniency of a superior in inflicting punishment on an inferior," as Seneca states (De Clementia ii, 3), and vengeance is taken by means of punishment, it would seem that clemency and meekness are the same.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) that "clemency is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is restrained by kindness when unreasonably provoked to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," so that apparently clemency moderates <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Now, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> [Ep. ccxi], <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and this is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of meekness and clemency. Therefore seemingly clemency and meekness are absolutely the same.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is not opposed to different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But the same <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, namely cruelty, is opposed to meekness and clemency. Therefore it seems that meekness and clemency are absolutely the same.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> According to the aforesaid definition of Seneca (Objection 1) "clemency is leniency of a superior towards an inferior": whereas meekness is not merely of superior to inferior, but of each to everyone. Therefore meekness and clemency are not absolutely the same.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in Ethic. ii, 3, a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and actions." Now internal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are principles of external actions, and are likewise obstacles thereto. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that moderate <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, to a certain extent, concur towards the same effect as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that moderate actions, although they differ specifically. Thus it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to restrain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, whereunto he is inclined by immoderate love or desire of money, which is restrained by liberality; so that liberality concurs with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards the effect, which is abstention from <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>. This applies to the case in point; because through the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> a man is provoked to inflict a too severe punishment, while it belongs directly to clemency to mitigate punishment, and this might be prevented by excessive <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p>Consequently meekness, in so far as it restrains the onslaught of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, concurs with clemency towards the same effect; yet they differ from one another, inasmuch as clemency moderates external punishment, while meekness properly mitigates the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Meekness regards properly the desire itself of vengeance; whereas clemency regards the punishment itself which is applied externally for the purpose of vengeance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> affections incline to the moderation of things that are unpleasant to him in themselves. Now it results from one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> another that he takes no pleasure in the latter's punishment in itself, but only as directed to something else, for instance <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or the correction of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> punished. Hence love makes one quick to mitigate punishment --and this pertains to clemency--while <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is an obstacle to such mitigation. For this reason Tully says that "the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> provoked to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>" that is to punish too severely, "is restrained by clemency," from inflicting too severe a punishment, so that clemency directly moderates not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> but punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which denotes excess in the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, is properly opposed to meekness, which is directly concerned with the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; while cruelty denotes excess in punishing. Wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "those are called cruel who have reason for punishing, but lack moderation in punishing." Those who delight in a man's punishment for its own sake may be called savage or brutal, as though lacking the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling that leads one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to love another.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether both clemency and meekness are virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that neither clemency nor meekness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet both of these are apparently opposed to severity, which is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore neither clemency nor meekness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Virtue is destroyed by excess and defect" [Ethic. ii, 2. But both clemency and meekness consist in a certain decrease; for clemency decreases punishment, and meekness decreases <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore neither clemency nor meekness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, meekness or mildness is included (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse4">Matthew 5:4</a>) among the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a>, and (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse23">Galatians 5:23</a>) among the fruits. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> differ from the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> and fruits. Therefore they are not comprised under <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 5): "Every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is conspicuous for his clemency and meekness." Now it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> properly that belongs to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> it is that makes its possessor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and renders his works <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore clemency and meekness are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in the subjection of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to reason, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> declares (Ethic. i, 13). Now this is verified both in clemency and in meekness. For clemency, in mitigating punishment, "is guided by reason," according to Seneca (De Clementia ii, 5), and meekness, likewise, moderates <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> according to right reason, as stated in Ethic. iv, 5. Wherefore it is manifest that both clemency and meekness are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Meekness is not directly opposed to severity; for meekness is about <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. On the other hand, severity regards the external infliction of punishment, so that accordingly it would seem rather to be opposed to clemency, which also regards external punishing, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Yet they are not really opposed to one another, since they are both according to right reason. For severity is inflexible in the infliction of punishment when right reason requires it; while clemency mitigates punishment also according to right reason, when and where this is requisite. Wherefore they are not opposed to one another as they are not about the same thing.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5), "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that observes the mean in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is unnamed; so that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is denominated from the diminution of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and is designated by the name of meekness." For the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more akin to diminution than to excess, because it is more <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to desire vengeance for injuries done to him, than to be lacking in that desire, since "scarcely anyone belittles an injury done to himself," as Sallust observes [Cf. 120]. As to clemency, it mitigates punishment, not in respect of that which is according to right reason, but as regards that which is according to common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is the object of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: yet on account of some particular consideration, it mitigates the punishment, deciding, as it were, that a man is not to be punished any further. Hence Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 1): "Clemency grants this, in the first place, that those whom she sets free are declared immune from all further punishment; and remission of punishment due amounts to a pardon." Wherefore it is clear that clemency is related to severity as equity [the Greek 'epieikeia' [Cf. 120]] to legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereof severity is a part, as regards the infliction of punishment in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Yet clemency differs from equity, as we shall state further on (3, ad 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">beatitudes</a> are acts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: while the fruits are delights in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> acts. Wherefore nothing hinders meekness being reckoned both <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and beatitude and fruit.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the aforesaid virtues are parts of temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are not parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For clemency mitigates punishment, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 10) ascribes this to equity, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above (Question 120, Article 2). Therefore seemingly clemency is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is concerned with <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>; whereas meekness and clemency regard, not <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and vengeance. Therefore they should not be reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be said to be of unsound mind when he takes pleasure in cruelty." Now this is opposed to clemency and meekness. Since then an unsound mind is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it seems that clemency and meekness are parts of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "clemency is <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in exercising the power of taking revenge." Tully also (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) reckons clemency a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Parts are assigned to the principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in so far as they imitate them in some secondary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as to the mode whence the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives its praise and likewise its name. Thus the mode and name of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consist in a certain "equality," those of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in a certain "strength of mind," those of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in a certain "restraint," inasmuch as it restrains the most vehement <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the pleasures of touch. Now clemency and meekness likewise consist in a certain restraint, since clemency mitigates punishment, while meekness represses <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as stated above (1 and 2). Therefore both clemency and meekness are annexed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> as principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and accordingly are reckoned to be parts thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Two points must be considered in the mitigation of punishment. one is that punishment should be mitigated in accordance with the lawgiver's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, although not according to the letter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; and in this respect it pertains to equity. The other point is a certain moderation of a man's inward disposition, so that he does not exercise his power of inflicting punishment. This belongs properly to clemency, wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "it is <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in exercising the power of taking revenge." This moderation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes from a certain sweetness of disposition, whereby a man recoils from anything that may be painful to another. Wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "clemency is a certain smoothness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>"; for, on the other hand, there would seem to be a certain roughness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in one who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> not to pain others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The annexation of secondary to principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> depends on the mode of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is, so to speak, a kind of form of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, rather than on the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now meekness and clemency agree with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in mode, as stated above, though they agree not in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Unsoundness" is corruption of "soundness." Now just as soundness of body is corrupted by the body lapsing from the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, so unsoundness of mind is due to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> lapsing from the disposition due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. This occurs both in respect of the reason, as when a man loses the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and in respect of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as when a man loses that humane feeling whereby "every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> friendly towards all other men" (Ethic. viii, 1). The unsoundness of mind that excludes the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But that a man who takes pleasure in the punishment of others is said to be of unsound mind, is because he seems on this account to be devoid of the humane feeling which gives rise to clemency.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether clemency and meekness are the greatest virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that clemency and meekness are the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is deserving of praise chiefly because it directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now meekness above all directs <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse21">James 1:21</a>): "With meekness receive the ingrafted word," and (<a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse13">Sirach 5:13</a>): "Be meek to hear the word" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. viii ad Demophil.) that "<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was deemed worthy of the Divine apparition on account of his great meekness." Therefore meekness is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is all the greater according as it is more acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men. Now meekness would appear to be most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse34">Sirach 1:34-35</a>): "That which is agreeable" to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and meekness"; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> expressly invites us to be meek like unto Himself (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a>), where He says: "Learn of Me, because I am meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart"; and <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> declares [Comment. in Matth. iv, 3 that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> dwells in us by our meekness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Again, it is most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse19">Sirach 3:19</a>): "My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>": for which reason it is also declared (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse28">Proverbs 20:28</a>) that the King's "throne is strengthened by clemency." Therefore meekness and clemency are the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 2) that "the meek are they who yield to reproaches, and resist not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." Now this seems to pertain to mercy or piety which would seem to be the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>] on <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, "Piety [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Godliness</a>'] is profitable to all things," observes that "piety is the sum total of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>." Therefore meekness and clemency are the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> They are not reckoned as principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but are annexed to another, as to a principal, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing prevents certain <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> from being greatest, not indeed simply, nor in every respect, but in a particular genus. It is impossible for clemency or meekness to be absolutely the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since they owe their praise to the fact that they withdraw a man from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by mitigating <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or punishment. Now it is more perfect to obtain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than to lack <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> like <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and likewise <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which direct one to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> simply, are absolutely greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> than clemency and meekness.

<p>Yet nothing prevents clemency and meekness from having a certain restricted excellence among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which resist <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> inclinations. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is mitigated by meekness, is, on account of its impetuousness, a very great obstacle to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> free judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: wherefore meekness above all makes a man self-possessed. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse31">Sirach 10:31</a>): "My son, keep thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in meekness." Yet the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of the pleasures of touch are more shameful, and harass more incessantly, for which reason <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is more rightly reckoned as a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. as stated above (141, 07, ad 2). As to clemency, inasmuch as it mitigates punishment, it would seem to approach nearest to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since thereby we do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> towards our neighbor, and hinder his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Meekness disposes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by removing an obstacle; and this in two ways. First, because it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> self-possessed by mitigating his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as stated above; secondly, because it pertains to meekness that a man does not contradict the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which many do through being disturbed by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 7): "To be meek is not to contradict <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, whether we understand it, if it condemn our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways, or understand it not, as though we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better and have a clearer insight of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Meekness and clemency make us acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, in so far as they concur with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, towards the same effect, namely the mitigation of our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Mercy and piety agree indeed with meekness and clemency by concurring towards the same effect, namely the mitigation of our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Nevertheless they differ as to motive. For piety relieves a neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through reverence for a superior, for instance <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or one's parents: mercy relieves a neighbor's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is displeasing to one, in so far as one looks upon it as affecting oneself, as stated above (Question 30, Article 2): and this results from friendship which makes friends rejoice and grieve for the same things: meekness does this, by removing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that urges to vengeance, and clemency does this through leniency of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in so far as it judges equitable that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be no further punished.
