<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it is lawful to be angry?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it cannot be lawful to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in his exposition on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>, "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother," etc. says: "Some codices add 'without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.' However, in the genuine codices the sentence is unqualified, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is forbidden altogether." Therefore it is nowise lawful to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv) "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be without reason." Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is always without reason: for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not listen perfectly to reason"; and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45) that "when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> sunders the tranquil surface of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it mangles and rends it by its riot"; and Cassian says (De Inst. Caenob. viii, 6): "From whatever <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it arises, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> passion boils over and blinds the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Therefore it is always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is "desire for vengeance" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Rhet. ii, 2 according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse17">Leviticus 19:17</a>, "Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thy brother in thy heart." Now it would seem unlawful to desire vengeance, since this should be left to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse35">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, "Revenge is Mine." Therefore it would seem that to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all that makes us depart from likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> always makes us depart from likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges with tranquillity according to <a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse18">Wisdom 12:18</a>. Therefore to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xi in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says: "He that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall be in danger; but he that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall not be in danger: for without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked." Therefore to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is not always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and gives its name to the irascible power, as stated above (I-II, 46, 1) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Now with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is to be observed that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be found in them in two ways. First by reason of the passion's very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which is derived from the passion's object. Thus <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, in respect of its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, denotes an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since it is displeasure at another's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and such displeasure is in itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> remarks (Ethic. ii, 6), "the very mention of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> denotes something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now this does not apply to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is the desire for revenge, since revenge may be desired both well and ill. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is found in a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> in respect of the passion's <a href="../cathen/12591a.htm">quantity</a>, that is in respect of its excess or deficiency; and thus <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be found in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, when, to wit, one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, more or less than right reason demands. But if one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in accordance with right reason, one's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is deserving of praise.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Stoics designated <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and all the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as emotions opposed to the order of reason; and accordingly they deemed <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and all other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as stated above (I-II, 24, 2) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> considers <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> whereby one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with one's neighbor, with the intent of doing him a wrong.--But, according to the Peripatetics, to whose opinion <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> inclines (De Civ. Dei ix, 4), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, whether they be moderated or not, according to reason: and in this sense <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Anger may stand in a twofold relation to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. First, antecedently; in this way it withdraws reason from its rectitude, and has therefore the character of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Secondly, consequently, inasmuch as the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is directed against <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and in accordance with reason, this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and is called "zealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45): "We must beware lest, when we use <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> as an instrument of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it overrule the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and go before it as its mistress, instead of following in reason's train, ever ready, as its handmaid, to obey." This latter <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, although it hinder somewhat the judgment of reason in the execution of the act, does not destroy the rectitude of reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45) that "zealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> troubles the eye of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> blinds it." Nor is it incompatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that the deliberation of reason be interrupted in the execution of what reason has deliberated: since art also would be hindered in its act, if it were to deliberate about what has to be done, while having to act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is unlawful to desire vengeance considered as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is to be punished, but it is praiseworthy to desire vengeance as a corrective of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and to this the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can tend, in so far as it is moved thereto by the reason: and when revenge is taken in accordance with the order of judgment, it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work, since he who has power to punish "is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister," as stated in <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse4">Romans 13:4</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> We can and ought to be like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but we cannot be altogether likened to Him in the mode of our desire, since in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as in us, the movement of which has to obey reason. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more firmly erect in withstanding <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, when it bows to the command of reason."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether anger is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For we demerit by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. But "we do not demerit by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, even as neither do we incur blame thereby," as stated in Ethic. ii, 5. Consequently no passion is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> as stated above (I-II, 46, 1) in the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> there is conversion to some mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> there is conversion not to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in what he cannot avoid," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> asserts [De Lib. Arb. iii, 18. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot avoid <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse5">Psalm 4:5</a>, "Be ye <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not," says: "The movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not in our power." Again, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (Ethic. vii, 6) that "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts with displeasure." Now displeasure is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> [De Fide Orth. ii, 4,30. But it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> act of a power, namely the irascible; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in a letter [Ep. xii ad Anton. Monach.] that "to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is the property of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse31">Ephesians 4:31</a>): "Let all indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Anger and indignation'] . . . be put away from you."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anger, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), is properly the name of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. A passion of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in so far as it is regulated by reason, whereas it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if it set the order of reason aside. Now the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in regard to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, may be considered in relation to two things. First, in relation to the appetible object to which <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> tends, and that is revenge. Wherefore if one desire revenge to be taken in accordance with the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the desire of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is praiseworthy, and is called "zealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>" [Cf. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Moral. v, 45. On the other hand, if one desire the taking of vengeance in any way whatever contrary to the order of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, for instance if he desire the punishment of one who has not deserved it, or beyond his deserts, or again contrary to the order prescribed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or not for the due end, namely the maintaining of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the correction of defaults, then the desire of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and this is called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p>Secondly, the order of reason in regard to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be considered in relation to the mode of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, namely that the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should not be immoderately fierce, neither internally nor externally; and if this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> be disregarded, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will not lack <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even though just vengeance be desired.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Since passion may be either regulated or not regulated by reason, it follows that a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> considered absolutely does not include the notion of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or demerit, of praise or blame. But as regulated by reason, it may be something <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and deserving of praise; while on the other hand, as not regulated by reason, it may be demeritorious and blameworthy. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 5) that "it is he who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in a certain way, that is praised or blamed."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of another, not for its own sake but for the sake of revenge, towards which his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> turns as to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is master of his actions through the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherefore as to the movements that forestall that judgment, it is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to prevent them as a whole, i.e. so that none of them arise, although his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is able to check each one, if it arise. Accordingly it is stated that the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power, to the extent namely that no such movement arise. Yet since this movement is somewhat in his power, it is not entirely sinless if it be inordinate. The statement of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> that "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> acts with displeasure," means that he is displeased, not with his being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, but with the injury which he deems done to himself: and through this displeasure he is moved to seek vengeance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The irascible power in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> subject to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, wherefore its act is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as it is in accord with reason, and in so far as it is against reason, it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether all anger is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse2">Job 5:2</a>): "Anger killeth the foolish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Anger indeed killeth the foolish']," and he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> killing, whence mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> takes its name. Therefore all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, nothing save mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deserving of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> condemnation. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> deserves <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> condemnation; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>): "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on this passage says that "the three things mentioned there, namely judgment, council, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>-fire, signify in a pointed manner different abodes in the state of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> corresponding to various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatsoever is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is of itself contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> declares in his commentary on <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>, "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother," etc. where he says that this is contrary to the love of your neighbor. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse5">Psalm 4:5</a>, "Be ye <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not," says: "Anger is venial if it does not proceed to action."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be inordinate and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in two ways, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). First, on the part of the appetible object, as when one desires <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> revenge; and thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the point of its genus, because it is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Nevertheless such like <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may happen to be a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of the imperfection of the act. This imperfection is considered either in relation to the subject desirous of vengeance, as when the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> forestalls the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; or in relation to the desired object, as when one desires to be avenged in a trifling <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which should be deemed of no account, so that even if one proceeded to action, it would not be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance by pulling a child slightly by the hair, or by some other like action. Secondly, the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be inordinate in the mode of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, for instance, if one be too fiercely <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> inwardly, or if one exceed in the outward signs of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. On this way <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the point of its genus; yet it may happen to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance if through the fierceness of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> a man fall away from the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It does not follow from the passage quoted that all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that the foolish are killed spiritually by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because, through not checking the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by their reason, they fall into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for instance by blaspheming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or by doing injury to their neighbor.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said this of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, by way of addition to the words of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: "Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse21">Matthew 5:21</a>). Consequently <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> is speaking here of the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> wherein a man desires the killing or any grave injury of his neighbor: and should the consent of reason be given to this desire, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it will be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In the case where <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, it is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it is not always so, as appears from what we have said.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether anger is the most grievous sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xlviii in Joan.] that "nothing is more repulsive than the look of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and nothing uglier than a ruthless* face, and most of all than a cruel <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." ['Severo'. The correct text is 'Si vero.' The translation would then run thus . . . 'and nothing uglier.' And if his 'face is ugly, how much uglier is his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>!']. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the more hurtful a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, the worse it would seem to be; since, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Enchiridion xii), "a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because it hurts." Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is most hurtful, because it deprives <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby he is master of himself; for <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Hom. xlviii in Joan.) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> differs in no way from <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; it is a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> while it lasts, indeed more troublesome than one harassed by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, inward movements are judged according to their outward effects. Now the effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Anger is compared to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> as the mote to the beam; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "Lest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> grow into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and a mote become a beam." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2), the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is considered in a twofold respect, namely with regard to an undue object, and with regard to an undue mode of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. As to the appetible object which it desires, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> would seem to be the least of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> desires the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment for some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, under the aspect of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that is vengeance. Hence on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which it desires the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> agrees with those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which desire the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of our neighbor, such as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; but while <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> desires absolutely another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as such, and the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through desire of his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of just revenge. Wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is more grievous than <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: since it is worse to desire <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and to desire <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as an external <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> such as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, than under the aspect of the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. On the part of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, under the aspect of which the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> concurs with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> that tends to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. On this respect again, absolutely speaking. the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is apparently less grievous than that of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires, is better than the pleasurable or useful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is desired by the subject of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 4) that "the incontinent in desire is more disgraceful than the incontinent in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>."

<p>On the other hand, as to the inordinateness which regards the mode of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> would seem to have a certain pre-eminence on account of the strength and quickness of its movement, according to <a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse4">Proverbs 27:4</a>, "Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of one provoked?" Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45): "The heart goaded by the pricks of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is convulsed, the body trembles, the tongue entangles itself, the face is inflamed, the eyes are enraged and fail utterly to recognize those whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: the tongue makes sounds indeed, but there is no sense in its utterance."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> is alluding to the repulsiveness of the outward gestures which result from the impetuousness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the inordinate movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that results from its impetuousness, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Murder results from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> no less than from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: yet <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is less grievous, inasmuch as it considers the aspect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stated above.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the Philosopher suitably assigns the species of anger?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are unsuitably assigned by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5) where he says that some <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are "choleric," some "sullen," and some "ill-tempered" or "stern." According to him, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be "sullen" whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> "is appeased with difficulty and endures a long time." But this apparently pertains to the circumstance of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> can be differentiated specifically in respect also of the other circumstances.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, he says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "ill-tempered" or "stern" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> "are those whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not appeased without revenge, or punishment." Now this also pertains to the unquenchableness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore seemingly the ill-tempered is the same as bitterness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> mentions three degrees of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, when He says (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a>): "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council, and whosoever shall say" to his brother, "Thou fool." But these degrees are not referable to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore it seems that the above division of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not fitting.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xx.] says "there are three <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of irascibility," namely, "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which is called wrath ['Fellea,' i.e. like gall. But in I-II, 46, 8, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> quoting the same authority has <em>Cholos</em> which we render 'wrath']," and "ill-will" which is a disease of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and "rancour." Now these three seem to coincide with the three aforesaid. For "wrath" he describes as "having beginning and movement," and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 5) ascribes this to "choleric" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: "ill-will" he describes as "an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that endures and grows old," and this the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> ascribes to "sullenness"; while he describes "rancour" as "reckoning the time for vengeance," which tallies with the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> description of the "ill-tempered." The same division is given by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 16). Therefore the aforesaid division assigned by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> is not unfitting.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The aforesaid distinction may be referred either to the passion, or to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. We have already stated when treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> (I-II, 46, 8) how it is to be applied to the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And it would seem that this is chiefly what <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> had in view. Here, however, we have to take the distinction of these <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> in its application to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and as set down by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>.

<p>For the inordinateness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be considered in relation to two things. First, in relation to the origin of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and this regards "choleric" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> too quickly and for any slight <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Secondly, in relation to the duration of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> endures too long; and this may happen in two ways. On one way, because the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to wit, the inflicted injury, remains too long in a man's <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, the result being that it gives rise to a lasting displeasure, wherefore he is "grievous" and "sullen" to himself. On another way, it happens on the part of vengeance, which a man seeks with a stubborn desire: this applies to "ill-tempered" or "stern" people, who do not put aside their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> until they have inflicted punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not time, but a man's propensity to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or his pertinacity in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that is the chief point of consideration in the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Both "sullen" and "ill-tempered" people have a long-lasting <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but for different reasons. For a "sullen" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has an abiding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on account of an abiding displeasure, which he holds locked in his breast; and as he does not break forth into the outward signs of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, others cannot reason him out of it, nor does he of his own accord lay aside his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, except his displeasure wear away with time and thus his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> cease. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of "ill-tempered" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is long-lasting on account of their intense desire for revenge, so that it does not wear out with time, and can be quelled only by revenge.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The degrees of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> do not refer to the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but correspond to the course of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> [Cf. I-II, 46, 8, Objection 3]. For the first degree is an inward conception, and in reference to this He says: "Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother." The second degree is when the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is manifested by outward signs, even before it breaks out into effect; and in reference to this He says: "Whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca!" which is an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> exclamation. The third degree is when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> conceived inwardly breaks out into effect. Now the effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is another's hurt under the aspect of revenge; and the least of hurts is that which is done by a mere word; wherefore in reference to this He says: "Whosoever shall say to his brother Thou fool!" Consequently it is clear that the second adds to the first, and the third to both the others; so that, if the first is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the case referred to by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, as stated above (3, ad 2), much more so are the others. Wherefore some kind of condemnation is assigned as corresponding to each one of them. On the first case "judgment" is assigned, and this is the least severe, for as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says [Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 9, "where judgment is to be delivered, there is an opportunity for defense": in the second case "council" is assigned, "whereby the judges deliberate together on the punishment to be inflicted": to the third case is assigned "<a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>-fire," i.e. "decisive condemnation."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether anger should be reckoned among the capital vices?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should not be reckoned among the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is born of sorrow which is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the name of sloth. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should not be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Therefore it should be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse22">Proverbs 29:22</a>, "An <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'passionate'] <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> provoketh quarrels," says: "Anger is the door to all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>: if it be closed, peace is ensured within to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; if it be opened, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is armed for every crime." Now no capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is the origin of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but only of certain definite ones. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should not be reckoned among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) places <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 84, 3,4), a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is defined as one from which many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise. Now there are two reasons for which many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> can arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. The first is on the part of its object which has much of the aspect of desirability, in so far as revenge is desired under the aspect of just or honest*, which is attractive by its excellence, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). [Honesty must be taken here in its broad sense as synonymous with moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, from the point of view of decorum; Cf. 145, 1. The second is on the part of its impetuosity, whereby it precipitates the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> into all kinds of inordinate action. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The sorrow whence <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> arises is not, for the most part, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of sloth, but the passion of sorrow, which results from an injury inflicted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (118, 07; 148, 5;k1 153, 4; I-II, 84, 4), it belongs to the notion of a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to have a most desirable end, so that many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed through the desire thereof. Now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which desires <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has a more desirable end than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> has, since the latter desires <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the aspect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is more a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Anger is stated to be the door to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, that is by removing obstacles, to wit by hindering the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is, however, directly the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of certain special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are called its daughters.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether six daughters are fittingly assigned to anger?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that six daughters are unfittingly assigned to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, namely "quarreling, swelling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, contumely, clamor, indignation and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>." For <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is reckoned by <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> [QQ. in Deut., qu. xvi] to be a daughter of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore it should not be accounted a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is born of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his rule (Ep. ccxi). Therefore it should be placed among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "a swollen mind" would seem to be the same as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the daughter of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but "the mother of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore swelling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> should not be reckoned among the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns these daughters to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anger may be considered in three ways. First, as consisting in thought, and thus two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arise from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. one is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and whom he deems unworthy [indignum] of acting thus towards him, and this is called "indignation." The other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, in so far as he devises various means of vengeance, and with such like thoughts fills his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job015.htm#verse2">Job 15:2</a>, "Will a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> . . . fill his stomach with burning heat?" And thus we have "swelling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>."

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be considered, as expressed in words: and thus a twofold disorder arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. One is when a man manifests his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in his manner of speech, as stated above (5, ad 3) of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who says to his brother, "Raca": and this refers to "clamor," which denotes disorderly and confused speech. The other disorder is when a man breaks out into injurious words, and if these be against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is "<a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>," if against one's neighbor, it is "contumely."

<p>Thirdly, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may be considered as proceeding to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> gives rise to "quarrels," by which we are to understand all manner of injuries inflicted on one's neighbor through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> into which a man breaks out deliberately proceeds from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, whereby a man lifts himself up against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: since, according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>, "the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," i.e. to fall away from reverence for Him is the first part of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> [Cf. 162, 07, ad 2; and this gives rise to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> into which a man breaks out through a disturbance of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, proceeds from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> sometimes arises from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, it has a previous <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from which it arises more directly, namely displeasure, even as, on the other hand, love is born of pleasure. Now through displeasure, a man is moved sometimes to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sometimes to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Wherefore it was fitting to reckon that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> arises from sloth rather than from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Swelling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not taken here as identical with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but for a certain effort or daring attempt to take vengeance; and daring is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether there is a vice opposed to anger resulting from lack of anger?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there. is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, resulting from lack of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> makes us like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now by being entirely without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, a man becomes like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who judges "with tranquillity" (<a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse18">Wisdom 12:18</a>). Therefore seemingly it is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to be altogether without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to lack what is altogether useless. But the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is useful for no purpose, as Seneca proves in the book he wrote on <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (De Ira i, 9, seqq.). Therefore it seems that lack of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv), "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be without reason." Now the judgment of reason remains unimpaired, if all movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be done away. Therefore no lack of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> amounts to a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> [Hom. xi in Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] says: "He who is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, whereas he has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For unreasonable patience is the hotbed of many <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, it fosters negligence, and incites not only the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> but even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to do wrong."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Anger may be understood in two ways. On one way, as a simple movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereby one inflicts punishment, not through passion, but in virtue of a judgment of the reason: and thus without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> lack of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is the sense in which <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is taken in the saying of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, for he says (Hom. xi in Matth., in the Opus Imperfectum, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>): "Anger, when it has a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> but judgment. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, properly speaking, denotes a movement of passion": and when a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with reason, his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is no longer from passion: wherefore he is said to judge, not to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. On another way <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is taken for a movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is with passion resulting from a bodily transmutation. This movement is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sequel, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to the movement of his will, since the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> follows the movement of the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, unless there be an obstacle. Hence the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> cannot be lacking altogether, unless the movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be altogether lacking or weak. Consequently lack of the passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is also a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, even as the lack of movement in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> directed to punishment by the judgment of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> He that is entirely without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when he ought to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, imitates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to lack of passion, but not as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishing by judgment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The passion of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, like all other movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, is useful, as being conducive to the more prompt execution [Cf. I-II, 24, 3 of reason's dictate: else, the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be to no purpose, whereas "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does nothing without purpose" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, De Coelo i, 4.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When a man acts inordinately, the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only of the simple movement of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but also of the passion in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as stated above. Wherefore just as the removal of the effect is a sign that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is removed, so the lack of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a sign that the judgment of reason is lacking.
