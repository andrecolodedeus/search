<h1>Question 15. Ideas</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1015.htm#article1"> Are there ideas?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1015.htm#article2"> Are they many, or one only?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1015.htm#article3"> Are there ideas of all things known by God?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there are ideas?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there are no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. vii), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things by <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are for nothing else except that things may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through them. Therefore there are no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things in Himself, as has been already said (14, 5). But He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Himself through an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; neither therefore other things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is considered to be the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and action. But the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is a sufficient principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and effecting all things. It is not therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi),"Such is the power inherent in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, that no one can be wise unless they are understood."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in the divine mind. For the Greek word <em>Idea</em> is in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> "forma." Hence by <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are understood the forms of things, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from the things themselves. Now the form of anything <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> apart from the thing itself can be for one of two ends: either to be the type of that of which it is called the form, or to be the principle of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that thing, inasmuch as the forms of things knowable are said to be in him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them. In either case we must suppose <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as is clear for the following reason:

<p>In all things not generated by chance, the form must be the end of any generation whatsoever. But an agent does not act on account of the form, except in so far as the likeness of the form is in the agent, as may happen in two ways. For in some agents the form of the thing to be made pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, as in those that act by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as a man generates a man, or fire generates fire. Whereas in other agents (the form of the thing to be made pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>) according to intelligible being, as in those that act by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and thus the likeness of a house pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the builder. And this may be called the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the house, since the builder intends to build his house like to the form conceived in his mind. As then the world was not made by chance, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acting by His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as will appear later (46, 1), there must <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the divine mind a form to the likeness of which the world was made. And in this the notion of an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not understand things according to an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> outside Himself. Thus <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Metaph. ix) rejects the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who held that <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> of themselves, and not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself and all else by His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, yet His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is the operative principle of all things, except of Himself. It has therefore the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> with respect to other things; though not with respect to Himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the similitude of all things according to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; therefore an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is identical with His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether ideas are many?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are not many. For an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is one only. Therefore there is only one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and operating, so are art and wisdom. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there are not several arts or wisdoms. Therefore in Him there is no plurality of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if it be said that <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are multiplied according to their relations to different creatures, it may be argued on the contrary that the plurality of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. If, then, <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are many, but creatures temporal, then the temporal must be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, these relations are either real in creatures only, or in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also. If in creatures only, since creatures are not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, the plurality of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> cannot be from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, if <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are multiplied only according to these relations. But if they are real in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that there is a real plurality in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> other than the plurality of Persons: and this is against the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. i, 10), who says, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things are one, except "ingenerability, generation, and procession." Ideas therefore are not many.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi), "Ideas are certain principal forms, or permanent and immutable types of things, they themselves not being formed. Thus they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> always in the same manner, as being contained in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. Whilst, however, they themselves neither come into being nor decay, yet we say that in accordance with them everything is formed that can rise or decay, and all that actually does so."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It must <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> be held that <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are many. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which it is to be considered that in every effect the ultimate end is the proper <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the principal agent, as the order of an army (is the proper <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>) of the general. Now the highest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in things is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> clearly teaches in Metaph. xii. Therefore the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is properly intended by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is not the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> result of a succession of agents, as has been supposed by those who have taught that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> only the first creature, and that this creature <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the second creature, and so on, until this great multitude of beings was produced. According to this opinion <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> thing alone; whereas, if the order itself of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by Him immediately, and intended by Him, He must have the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Now there cannot be an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of any whole, unless particular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are had of those parts of which the whole is made; just as a builder cannot conceive the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a house unless he has the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of each of its parts. So, then, it must needs be that in the divine mind there are the proper <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of all things. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi), "that each thing was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> proper to it," from which it follows that in the divine mind <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are many. Now it can easily be seen how this is not repugnant to the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we consider that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a work is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the operator as that which is understood, and not as the image whereby he understands, which is a form that makes the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in act. For the form of the house in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the builder, is something understood by him, to the likeness of which he forms the house in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now, it is not repugnant to the simplicity of the divine mind that it understand many things; though it would be repugnant to its simplicity were His understanding to be formed by a plurality of images. Hence many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the divine mind, as things understood by it; as can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thus. Inasmuch as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> perfectly, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it according to every mode in which it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Now it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only as it is in itself, but as it can be participated in by creatures according to some degree of likeness. But every creature has its own proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, according to which it participates in some degree in likeness to the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. So far, therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as capable of such imitation by any creature, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it as the particular type and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of that creature; and in like manner as regards other creatures. So it is clear that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands many particular types of things and these are many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not called an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in so far as it is that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but only in so far as it is the likeness or type of this or that thing. Hence <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are said to be many, inasmuch as many types are understood through the self-same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By wisdom and art we signify that by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands; but an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understands. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by one understands many things, and that not only according to what they are in themselves, but also according as they are understood, and this is to understand the several types of things. In the same way, an architect is said to understand a house, when he understands the form of the house in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. But if he understands the form of a house, as devised by himself, from the fact that he understands that he understands it, he thereby understands the type or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the house. Now not only does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> understand many things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but He also understands that He understands many things by His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And this means that He understands the several types of things; or that many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are in His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as understood by Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Such relations, whereby <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are multiplied, are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> not by the things themselves, but by the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> comparing its own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with these things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Relations multiplying <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> do not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet they are not real relations, such as those whereby the Persons are distinguished, but relations understood by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there are ideas of all things that God knows?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there are not <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since it would follow that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was in Him. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there are not <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of all things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> things that neither are, nor will be, nor have been, as has been said above (<a href="#9">Article 9</a>). But of such things there are no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. v): "Acts of the divine will are the determining and effective types of things." Therefore there are not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, of which there can be no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, since it has no form. Hence the same conclusion.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not only <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, but also genera, singulars, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>. But there are not <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of these, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> teaching, who first taught <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi). Therefore there are not <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Ideas are types <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in the divine mind, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi). But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the proper types of all things that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; and therefore He has <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, are principles of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things and of their generation, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> has this twofold office, as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So far as the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the principle of the making of things, it may be called an "exemplar," and belongs to practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But so far as it is a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is properly called a "type," and may belong to speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also. As an exemplar, therefore, it has respect to everything made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in any period of time; whereas as a principle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it has respect to all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even though they never come to be in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; and to all things that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> according to their proper type, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him in a speculative manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not through its own type, but through the type of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a>, therefore, has no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither in so far as an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is an "exemplar" nor as a "type."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has no practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, except virtually, of things which neither are, nor will be, nor have been. Hence, with respect to these there is no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in so far as <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> signifies an "exemplar" but only in so far as it denotes a "type."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is said by some to have considered <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>; and therefore he postulated not an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> but a concause with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Since, however, we hold <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though not apart from form, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> has its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but not apart from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the composite; for <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in itself can neither <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, nor be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Genus can have no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, in so far as <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> denotes an "exemplar"; for genus cannot <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> except in some <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. The same is the case with those <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> that inseparably accompany their subject; for these come into being along with their subject. But <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> which supervene to the subject, have their special <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. For an architect produces through the form of the house all the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> that originally accompany it; whereas those that are superadded to the house when completed, such as painting, or any other such thing, are produced through some other form. Now <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> things, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, have no other <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> than that of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; both because particular things are individualized by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, which, as some say, he held to be uncreated and the concause with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; and because the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and produces <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> only that in them the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> may be preserved. However, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> extends not merely to <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; but to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> as will be shown later (22, 3).
