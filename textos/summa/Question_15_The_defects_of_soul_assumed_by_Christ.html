<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there was sin in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse2">Psalm 21:2</a>): "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . why hast Thou forsaken Me? Far from My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are the words of My <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now these words are said in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, as appears from His having uttered them on the cross. Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there were <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>) that "in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>"--namely, because all were in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by origin. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by origin. Therefore He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse18">Hebrews 2:18</a>) that "in that, wherein He Himself hath suffered and been tempted, He is able to succor them also that are tempted." Now above all do we require His help against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that there was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) that "Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>), "for us" <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "hath made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." But that really is, which has been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there was really <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Agone Christ. xi), "in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> gave Himself to us as a pattern of living." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs a pattern not merely of right living, but also of repentance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore it seems that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there ought to have been <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that He might repent of His <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus afford us a pattern of repentance.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> He Himself says (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse46">John 8:46</a>): "Which of you shall convince Me of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (Question 14, Article 1), Christ assumed our defects that He might satisfy for us, that He might <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that He might become an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to us. Now it is plain that by reason of these three things He ought not to have assumed the defect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. First, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> nowise works our satisfaction; rather, it impedes the power of satisfying, since, as it is written (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse23">Sirach 34:23</a>), "The Most High approveth not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>." Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereof <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; but rather has been sown in it against its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 20). Thirdly, because by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> He could afford no example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> nowise assumed the defect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--either original or actual--according to what is written (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a>): "Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 25), things are said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, first, with reference to His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and hypostatic property, as when it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> became <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that He suffered for us; secondly, with reference to His personal and relative property, when things are said of Him in our <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> which nowise belong to Him of Himself. Hence, in the seven rules of Tichonius which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> quotes in De Doctr. Christ. iii, 31, the first regards "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and His Body," since "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His Church are taken as one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, speaking in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of His members, says (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse2">Psalm 21:2</a>): "The words of My <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>"--not that there were any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the Head.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. x, 20), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and the other fathers not altogether as we were. For we were in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as regards both seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, since, as he goes on to say: "As in the seed there is a visible bulk and an invisible <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, both have come from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took the visible <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of His flesh from the Virgin's flesh; but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His conception did not spring from the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but far otherwise--from on high." Hence He was not in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> according to seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only according to bodily <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not receive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> actively, but only materially--and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> actively; even as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> received his body materially from the slime of the earth--actively from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, in whom He was only as regards His <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In His <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and passion Christ has succored us by satisfying for us. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not further satisfaction, but hinders it, as has been said. Hence, it behooved Him not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to be wholly free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; otherwise the punishment He bore would have been due to Him for His own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"--not, indeed, in such sort that He had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that He made Him a sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: even as it is written (<a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse8">Hosea 4:8</a>): "They shall eat the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of My people"--they, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> ate the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And in that way it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse6">Isaiah 53:6</a>) that "the Lord hath laid on Him the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of us all" (i.e. He gave Him up to be a victim for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>); or "He made Him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (i.e. made Him to have "the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh"), as is written (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a>), and this on account of the passible and mortal body He assumed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> A penitent can give a praiseworthy example, not by having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but by freely bearing the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> set the highest example to penitents, since He willingly bore the punishment, not of His own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there was the "fomes" of sin in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the passibility and mortality of the body spring from the same principle, to wit, from the withdrawal of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereby the inferior powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were subject to the reason, and the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now passibility and mortality of body were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore there was also the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 19), "it was by consent of the Divine will that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was allowed to suffer and do what belonged to it." But it is proper to the flesh to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after its pleasures. Now since the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing more than <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse8">Romans 7:8</a>, it seems that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is by reason of the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusteth</a> against the spirit," as is written (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians 5:17</a>). But the spirit is shown to be so much the stronger and worthier to be crowned according as the more completely it overcomes its enemy--to wit, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2 Timothy 2:5</a>, he "is not crowned except he strive lawfully." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a most valiant and conquering spirit, and one most worthy of a crown, according to <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse2">Apocalypse 6:2</a>: "There was a crown given Him, and He went forth conquering that He might conquer." Therefore it would especially seem that the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ought to have been in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew 1:20</a>): "That which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> drives out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the inclination to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is implied in the word "fomes." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there ought not to have been the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (7, 2,9), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> most perfectly. Now moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are in the irrational part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, make it subject to reason, and so much the more as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more perfect; thus, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> controls the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and meekness the irascible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, as was said in I-II, 56, 4. But there belongs to the very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> an inclination of the sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to what is contrary to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. And hence it is plain that the more perfect the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the weaker the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> becomes in him. Hence, since in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were in their highest degree, the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was nowise in Him; inasmuch, also, as this defect cannot be ordained to satisfaction, but rather inclined to what is contrary to satisfaction.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The inferior powers pertaining to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> capacity to be obedient to reason; but not the bodily powers, nor those of the bodily humors, nor those of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as is made plain Ethic. i, 13. And hence perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is in accordance with right reason, does not exclude passibility of body; yet it excludes the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which consists in the resistance of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The flesh <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> seeks what is pleasing to it by the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; but the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is a rational animal, seeks this after the manner and order of reason. And thus with the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> sought food, drink, and sleep, and all else that is sought in right reason, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 14). Yet it does not therefore follow that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this implies the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after pleasurable things against the order of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The spirit gives evidence of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to some extent by resisting that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh which is opposed to it; yet a greater <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of spirit is shown, if by its strength the flesh is thoroughly overcome, so as to be incapable of lusting against the spirit. And hence this belonged to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose spirit reached the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. And although He suffered no internal assault on the part of the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He sustained an external assault on the part of the world and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and won the crown of victory by overcoming them.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether in Christ there was ignorance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which belongs to Him in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, although it does not belong to Him in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as suffering and death. But <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 21) that "He assumed an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and enslaved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one is said to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> through defect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now some kind of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> was wanting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) "Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for us He hath made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore there was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse4">Isaiah 8:4</a>): "For before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to call his Father and his mother, the strength of Damascus . . . shall be taken away." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of certain things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">Ignorance</a> is not taken away by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to take away our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for "He came to enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse79">Luke 1:79</a>). Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As there was the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so too there was the fulness of all <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as is plain from what has been said above (7, 9; 9). Now as the fulness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> excluded the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> excluded <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence, even as the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, neither was there <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be viewed in two ways. First, in its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> calls it "<a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and enslaved"; hence he adds: "For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> of Him" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) "Who made it; and it has no <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of future things." Secondly, it may be considered with regard to what it has from its union with the Divine hypostasis, from which it has the fulness of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>: "We saw Him [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'] as it were the Only-begotten of the Father, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and in this way the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not affected with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is said not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because He did not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> it by experience; but He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> it by simple cognition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is speaking in this passage of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ; thus he says: "Before the Child" (i.e. in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) "<a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> to call His father" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, who was His reputed father), "and His mother" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>), "the strength of Damascus . . . shall be taken away." Nor are we to understand this as if He had been some time a man without <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> it; but "before He <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>" (i.e. before He is a man having <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>)--literally, "the strength of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away by the King of the Assyrians"--or spiritually, "before His birth He will save His people solely by invocation," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds it. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> however (Serm. xxxii de Temp.) says that this was fulfilled in the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. For he says: "Before He uttered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> words in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, He received the strength of Damascus, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> which Damascus vaunted (for in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> the first place is given to gold). They themselves were the spoils of Samaria. Because Samaria is taken to signify <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; since this people, having turned away from the Lord, turned to the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Hence these were the first spoils which the child took from the domination of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>." And in this way "before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>" may be taken to mean "before he show himself to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Christ's soul was passible?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not passible. For nothing suffers except by reason of something stronger; since "the agent is greater than the patient," as is clear from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16), and from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima iii, 5). Now no creature was stronger than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not suffer at the hands of any creature; and hence it was not passible; for its capability of suffering would have been to no purpose if it could not have suffered at the hands of anything.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Tully (De Tusc. Quaes. iii) says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are ailments [Cf. I-II, 24, 2]. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had no ailment; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> ailment results from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as is plain from <a href="../bible/psa040.htm#verse5">Psalm 40:5</a>: "Heal my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Thee." Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there were no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> would seem to be the same as the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse5">Romans 7:5</a>) calls them the "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Now the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said 2. Therefore it seems that there were no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and hence His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not passible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse4">Psalm 87:4</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ: "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>"--not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, indeed, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, i.e. "pains," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds it. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was passible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> placed in a body may suffer in two ways: first with a bodily passion; secondly, with an animal passion. It suffers with a bodily passion through bodily hurt; for since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the form of the body, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body have but one being; and hence, when the body is disturbed by any bodily passion, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, too, must be disturbed, i.e. in the being which it has in the body. Therefore, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was passible and mortal, as was said above (Question 14, Article 2), His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also was of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> passible in like manner. But the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers with an animal passion, in its operations--either in such as are proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or in such as are of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more than of the body. And although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to suffer in this way through sensation and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, as was said in I-II, 22, 3; I-II, 41, 1; nevertheless the affections of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> are most properly called <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now these were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as all else pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> having deigned to live in the form of a servant, took these upon Himself whenever He judged they ought to be assumed; for there was no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affection in Him Who had a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p>Nevertheless we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> were in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> otherwise than in us, in three ways. First, as regards the object, since in us these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> very often tend towards what is unlawful, but not so in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Secondly, as regards the principle, since these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in us frequently forestall the judgment of reason; but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> sprang from the disposition of the reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9), that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> assumed these movements, in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by an unfailing dispensation, when He willed; even as He became <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when He willed." Thirdly, as regards the effect, because in us these movements, at times, do not remain in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but deflect the reason; but not so in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since by His disposition the movements that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> becoming to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh so remained in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that the reason was nowise hindered in doing what was right. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (on <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew 26:37</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reality of the assumed manhood, 'was sorrowful' in very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>; yet lest a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> should hold sway over His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is by a propassion that He is said to have 'begun to grow sorrowful and to be sad'"; so that it is a perfect "passion" when it dominates the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, i.e. the reason; and a "propassion" when it has its beginning in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but goes no further.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have prevented these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> from coming upon it, and especially by the Divine power; yet of His own will He subjected Himself to these corporeal and animal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Tully is speaking there according to the opinions of the Stoics, who did not give the name of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to all, but only to the disorderly movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Now, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> like these were not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" are movements of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that tend to unlawful things; and these were not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as neither was the "fomes" of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there was sensible pain in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sensible pain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. x): "Since with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to die was life, what pain may He be supposed to have suffered in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His death, Who bestows life on such as die for Him?" And further on he says: "The Only-begotten assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not ceasing to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and although blows struck Him and wounds were inflicted on Him, and scourges fell upon Him, and the cross lifted Him up, yet these wrought in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> the vehemence of the passion, but brought no pain; as a dart piercing the water." Hence there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it would seem to be proper to flesh conceived in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of pain. But the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not conceived in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the Virgin's womb. Therefore it lay under no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of suffering pain.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the delight of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Divine things dulls the sense of pain; hence the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> bore up more bravely by thinking of the Divine love. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in the perfect enjoyment of contemplating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom He saw in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as was said above (Question 9, Article 2). Therefore He could feel no pain.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah 53:4</a>): "Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As is plain from what has been said in I-II, 35, 7, for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bodily pain are required bodily hurt and the sense of hurt. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was able to be hurt, since it was passible and mortal, as above stated (14, 1,2); neither was the sense of hurt wanting to it, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possessed perfectly all <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers. Therefore no one should <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pain.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In all these and similar words, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> does not intend to exclude the reality of the pain, but the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of it. Hence after the foregoing he adds: "Nor, when He thirsted, or hungered, or wept, was the Lord seen to drink, or eat, or grieve. But in order to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the reality of the body, the body's customs were assumed, so that the custom of our body was atoned for by the custom of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Or when He took drink or food, He acceded, not to the body's <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, but to its custom." And he uses the word "<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>" in reference to the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these defects, which is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as above stated (14, 1,3), so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh is said not to have lain under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of these defects, in the sense that there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in it. Hence he adds: "For He" (i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) "had a body--one proper to His origin, which did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> through the unholiness of our conception, but subsisted in the form of our body by the strength of His power." But as regards the proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these defects, which is composition of contraries, the flesh of Christ lay under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of these defects, as was said above (14, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Flesh conceived in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is subject to pain, not merely on account of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles, but from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but only the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was said above (14, 1, ad 2), by the power of the Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the beatitude was economically kept in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so as not to overflow into the body, lest His passibility and mortality should be taken away; and for the same reason the delight of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> was so kept in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as not to overflow into the sensitive powers, lest sensible pain should thereby be prevented.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there was sorrow in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no sorrow. For it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse4">Isaiah 42:4</a>): "He shall not be sad nor troublesome."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse21">Proverbs 12:21</a>): "Whatever shall befall the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it shall not make him sad." And the reason of this the Stoics asserted to be that no one is saddened save by the loss of his goods. Now the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> esteems only <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as his goods, and these he cannot lose; otherwise the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would be subject to fortune if he was saddened by the loss of the goods fortune has given him. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse6">Jeremiah 23:6</a>: "This is the name that they shall call Him: The Lord, our just one." Therefore there was no sorrow in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 13,14) that all sorrow is "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to be shunned." But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be shunned. Therefore there was no sorrow in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Furthermore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6): "Sorrow regards the things we suffer unwillingly." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered nothing against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah 53:7</a>): "He was offered because it was His own will." Hence there was no sorrow in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew 26:38</a>): "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death." And <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Trin. ii.) that "as a man He had sorrow; for He bore my sorrow. I call it sorrow, fearlessly, since I preach the cross."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (5, ad 3), by Divine dispensation the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mind so as not to overflow into the sensitive powers, and thereby shut out sensible pain. Now even as sensible pain is in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, so also is sorrow. But there is a difference of motive or object; for the object and motive of pain is hurt perceived by the sense of touch, as when anyone is wounded; but the object and motive of sorrow is anything hurtful or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> interiorly, apprehended by the reason or the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as was said in I-II, 35, 2,7, as when anyone grieves over the loss of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or money. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could apprehend things as hurtful either to Himself, as His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> and death--or to others, as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> that killed Him. And hence, as there could be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so too could there be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sorrow; otherwise, indeed, than in us, in the three ways above stated (4), when we were speaking of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in general.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sorrow was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a perfect passion; yet it was inchoatively in Him as a "propassion." Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew 26:37</a>): "He began to grow sorrowful and to be sad." For "it is one thing to be sorrowful and another to grow sorrowful," as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says, on this text.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 8), "for the three <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>"--desire, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and fear--the Stoics held three <em>eupatheias</em> i.e. <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, viz. for desire, will--for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, delight--for fear, caution. But as regards sorrow, they denied it could be in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for sorrow regards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> already present, and they thought that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could befall a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and for this reason, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that only the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since it makes men <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that nothing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, except what is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, whereby men become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Now although what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chief <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and what is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> chief <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since these pertain to reason which is supreme in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet there are certain secondary goods of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which pertain to the body, or to the exterior things that minister to the body. And hence in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there may be sorrow in the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> by his apprehending these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; without this sorrow disturbing the reason. And in this way are we to understand that "whatsoever shall befall the just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it shall not make him sad," because his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is troubled by no misfortune. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sorrow was a propassion, and not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All sorrow is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment; but it is not always an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault, except only when it proceeds from an inordinate affection. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9): "Whenever these affections follow reason, and are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> when and where needed, who will dare to call them diseases or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is no reason why a thing may not of itself be contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and yet be willed by reason of the end, to which it is ordained, as bitter medicine is not of itself desired, but only as it is ordained to health. And thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death and passion were of themselves involuntary, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> sorrow, although they were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> as ordained to the end, which is the redemption of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether there was fear in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no fear in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse1">Proverbs 28:1</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, bold as a lion, shall be without dread." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most just. Therefore there was no fear in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. x): "I ask those who think thus, does it stand to reason that He should dread to die, Who by expelling all dread of death from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostles</a>, encouraged them to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>?" Therefore it is unreasonable that there should be fear in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, fear seems only to regard what a man cannot avoid. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have avoided both the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment which He endured, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault which befell others. Therefore there was no fear in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse33">Mark 14:33</a>): <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "began to fear and to be heavy."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As sorrow is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the apprehension of a present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so also is fear <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the apprehension of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the apprehension of a future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be quite certain, does not arouse fear. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Rhet. ii, 5) that we do not fear a thing unless there is some hope of avoiding it. For when there is no hope of avoiding it the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is considered present, and thus it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> sorrow rather than fear. Hence fear may be considered in two ways. First, inasmuch as the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> shrinks from bodily hurt, by sorrow if it is present, and by fear if it is future; and thus fear was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even as sorrow. Secondly, fear may be considered in the uncertainty of the future event, as when at night we are frightened at a sound, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what it is; and in this way there was no fear in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The just <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be "without dread," in so far as dread implies a perfect passion drawing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from what reason dictates. And thus fear was not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only as a propassion. Hence it is said (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse33">Mark 14:33</a>) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> "began to fear and to be heavy," with a propassion, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> expounds (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew 26:37</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> excludes fear from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the same way that he excludes sorrow, i.e. as regards the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of fearing. And yet to show the reality of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> assumed fear, even as sorrow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could have avoided future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by the power of His Godhead, yet they were unavoidable, or not easily avoidable by the weakness of the flesh.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether there was wonder in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was no wonder. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. i, 2) that wonder results when we see an effect without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and thus wonder belongs only to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Now there was no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as was said [3]. Therefore there was no wonder in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) that "wonder is fear springing from the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of something great"; and hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 3) that the "magnanimous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not wonder." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most magnanimous. Therefore there was no wonder in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wonders at what he himself can do. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could do whatsoever was great. Therefore it seems that He wondered at nothing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse10">Matthew 8:10</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing this," i.e. the words of the centurion, "marveled."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Wonder properly regards what is new and unwonted. Now there could be nothing new and unwonted as regards Christ's Divine <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby He saw things in the Word; nor as regards the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby He saw things by infused <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Yet things could be new and unwonted with regard to His empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, in regard to which new things could occur to Him day by day. Hence, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with respect to His Divine <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, and His beatific and even His infused <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, there was no wonder in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if we speak of Him with respect to empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, wonder could be in Him; and He assumed this affection for our instruction, i.e. in order to teach us to wonder at what He Himself wondered at. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Gen. Cont. Manich. i, 8): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> wondered in order to show us that we, who still need to be so affected, must wonder. Hence all these emotions are not signs of a disturbed mind, but of a master teaching."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of nothing, yet new things might occur to His empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, and thus wonder would be <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not marvel at the Centurion's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as if it was great with respect to Himself, but because it was great with respect to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He could do all things by the Divine power, for with respect to this there was no wonder in Him, but only with respect to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> empiric <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowledge</a>, as was said above.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether there was anger in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there was no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse20">James 1:20</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worketh not the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now whatever was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pertained to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since of Him it is written (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>): "For He [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Who'] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made unto us . . . <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>." Therefore it seems that there was no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is opposed to meekness, as is plain from Ethic. iv, 5. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was most meek. Therefore there was no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in Him.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v, 45) that "<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that comes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> blinds the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that comes of zeal disturbs it." Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> eye in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was neither blinded nor disturbed. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there was neither <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> nor zealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse17">John 2:17</a>) that the words of <a href="../bible/psa058.htm#verse10">Psalm 58:10</a>, "the zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up," were fulfilled in Him.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said in I-II, 46, 3, ad 3, and II-II, 158, 2, ad 3, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is an effect of sorrow. or when sorrow is inflicted upon someone, there arises within him a desire of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to repel this injury brought upon himself or others. Hence <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> composed of sorrow and the desire of revenge. Now it was said (6) that sorrow could be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As to the desire of revenge it is sometimes with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e. when anyone seeks revenge beyond the order of reason: and in this way <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> could not be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for this kind of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Sometimes, however, this desire is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--nay, is praiseworthy, e.g. when anyone seeks revenge according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and this is zealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (on <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse17">John 2:17</a>) that "he is eaten up by zeal for the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who seeks to better whatever He sees to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it, and if he cannot right it, bears with it and sighs." Such was the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. v), <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in two ways--sometimes it forestalls reason, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> it to operate, and in this way it is properly said to work, for operations are attributed to the principal agent. It is in this way that we must understand that "the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worketh not the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Sometimes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> follows reason, and is, as it were, its instrument, and then the operation, which pertains to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, is not attributed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> but to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which outsteps the bounds of reason that is opposed to meekness, and not the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which is controlled and brought within its proper bounds by reason, for meekness holds the mean in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In us the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> order is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers mutually impede each other, i.e. if the operation of one power is intense, the operation of the other is weakened. This is the reason why any movement whatsoever of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, even if it be tempered by reason, dims the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> eye of him who contemplates. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by control of the Divine power, "every faculty was allowed to do what was proper to it," and one power was not impeded by another. Hence, as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of His mind in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> did not impede the sorrow or pain of the inferior part, so, conversely, the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the inferior part no-wise impeded the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether Christ was at once a wayfarer and a comprehensor?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not at once a wayfarer and a comprehensor. For it belongs to a wayfarer to be moving toward the end of beatitude, and to a comprehensor it belongs to be resting in the end. Now to be moving towards the end and to be resting in the end cannot belong to the same. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not be at once wayfarer and comprehensor.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to tend to beatitude, or to obtain it, does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body, but to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ad Dios. cxviii) that "upon the inferior <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is the body, there overflows, not indeed the beatitude which belongs to such as enjoy and understand, the fulness of health, i.e. the vigor of incorruption." Now although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a passible body, He fully enjoyed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mind. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a wayfarer but a comprehensor.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Saints, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and whose bodies are in the tomb, enjoy beatitude in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, although their bodies are subject to death, yet they are called not wayfarers, but only comprehensors. Hence, with equal reason, would it seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a pure comprehensor and nowise a wayfarer, since His mind enjoyed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> although His body was mortal.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer014.htm#verse8">Jeremiah 14:8</a>): "Why wilt Thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turning in to lodge?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called a wayfarer from tending to beatitude, and a comprehensor from having already obtained beatitude, according to <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>: "So run that you may comprehend [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'obtain']"; and <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians 3:12</a>: "I follow after, if by any means I may comprehend [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'obtain']". Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfect beatitude consists in both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as stated in I-II, 4, 6. In the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as regards what is proper to it, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> sees and enjoys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in the body, inasmuch as the body "will rise <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> in power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and incorruption," as is written <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse42">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>. Now before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mind saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fully, and thus He had beatitude as far as it regards what is proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but beatitude was wanting with regard to all else, since His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was passible, and His body both passible and mortal, as is clear from the above (4; 14, 1,2). Hence He was at once comprehensor, inasmuch as He had the beatitude proper to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and at the same time wayfarer, inasmuch as He was tending to beatitude, as regards what was wanting to His beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is impossible to be moving towards the end and resting in the end, in the same respect; but there is nothing against this under a different respect--as when a man is at once acquainted with what he already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and yet is a learner with regard to what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Beatitude principally and properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet secondarily and, so to say, instrumentally, bodily goods are required for beatitude; thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. i, 8), that exterior goods minister "organically" to beatitude.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no parity between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for two reasons: first, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are not passible, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was; secondly, because their bodies do nothing by which they tend to beatitude, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by His bodily sufferings tended to beatitude as regards the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body.
