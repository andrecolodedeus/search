<h1>Question 15. The means of making satisfaction</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5015.htm#article1"> Must satisfaction be made by means of penal works?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5015.htm#article2"> Are the scourges, whereby God punishes man in this life, satisfactory?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5015.htm#article3"> Are the works of satisfaction suitably reckoned, by saying that there are three, viz. almsdeeds, fasting, and prayer?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether satisfaction must be made by means of penal works?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that satisfaction need not be made by means of penal works. For satisfaction should make compensation for the offense committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, seemingly, no compensation is given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by penal works, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not delight in our sufferings, as appears from <a href="../bible/tob003.htm#verse22">Tobit 3:22</a>. Therefore satisfaction need not be made by means of penal works.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from which a work proceeds, the less penal is that work, for "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> hath no pain [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> casteth out fear, because fear hath pain']" according to <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1 John 4:18</a>. If therefore works of satisfaction need to be penal, the more they proceed from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, the less satisfactory will they be: which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "Satisfaction," as <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> states (Cur Deus homo i) "consists in giving due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But this can be done by other means than penal works. Therefore satisfaction needs not to be made by means of penal works.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. in Evang. xx): "It is just that the sinner, by his repentance, should inflict on himself so much the greater suffering, as he has brought greater harm on himself by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p>Further, the wound <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be perfectly healed by satisfaction. Now punishment is the remedy for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 3). Therefore satisfaction should be made by means of penal works.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 12, Article 3), satisfaction regards both the past offense, for which compensation is made by its means, and also future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wherefrom we are preserved thereby: and in both respects satisfaction needs to be made by means of penal works. For compensation for an offense implies equality, which must needs be between the offender and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom he offends. Now equalization in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in taking away from one that which he has too much of, and giving it to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from whom something has been taken. And, although nothing can be taken away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as He is concerned, yet the sinner, for his part, deprives Him of something by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> as stated above (12, 3,4). Consequently, in order that compensation be made, something by way of satisfaction that may conduce to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be taken away from the sinner. Now a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work, as such, does not deprive the agent of anything, but perfects him: so that the deprivation cannot be effected by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work unless it be penal. Therefore, in order that a work be satisfactory it needs to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that it may conduce to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and it must be penal, so that something may be taken away from the sinner thereby.

<p>Again punishment preserves from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because a man does not easily fall back into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when he has had experience of the punishment. Wherefore, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 3) punishments are medicinal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not delight in our punishments as such, yet He does, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and thus they can be satisfactory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as, in satisfaction, we have to note the penality of the work, so, in <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, we must observe its difficulty. Now if the difficulty of the work itself be diminished, other things being equal, the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is also diminished; but if the difficulty be diminished on the part of the promptitude of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this does not diminish the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, but increases it; and, in like manner, diminution of the penality of a work, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being made more prompt by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, does not lessen the efficacy of satisfaction, but increases it.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which is due for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is compensation for the offense, and this cannot be done without punishment of the sinner. It is of this debt that <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> speaks.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the scourges of the present life are satisfactory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the scourges whereby we are punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, cannot be satisfactory. For nothing but what is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> can be satisfactory, as is clear from what has been said (14, 2). But we do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> except by what is in our own power. Since therefore the scourges with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes us are not in our power, it seems that they cannot be satisfactory.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, only the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> make satisfaction. But these scourges are inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> also, and are deserved by them most of all. Therefore they cannot be satisfactory.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, satisfaction regards past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But these scourges are sometimes inflicted on those who have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as in the case of Job. Therefore it seems that they are not satisfactory.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans 5:3-4</a>): "Tribulation worketh patience, and patience trial, i.e. deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains it.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (Super Ps. 118): "Although <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," i.e. the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "be lacking, the punishment satisfies." Therefore the scourges of this life are satisfactory.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Compensation for a past offense can be enforced either by the offender or by another. When it is enforced by another, such compensation is of a vindictive rather than of a satisfactory <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whereas when it is made by the offender, it is also satisfactory. Consequently, if the scourges, which are inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, become in some way the act of the sufferer they acquire a satisfactory character. Now they become the act of the sufferer in so far as he accepts them for the cleansing of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by taking advantage of them patiently. If, however, he refuse to submit to them patiently, then they do not become his personal act in any way, and are not of a satisfactory, but merely of a vindictive character.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although these scourges are not altogether in our power, yet in some respect they are, in so far as we use them patiently. In this way <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, so that such things can become both <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> and satisfactory.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Civ. Dei i, 8), even as "the same fire makes gold glisten and straw reek," so by the same scourges are the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cleansed and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> worsened on account of their impatience. Hence, though the scourges are common to both, satisfaction is only on the side of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These scourges always regard past guilt, not always the guilt of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but sometimes the guilt of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For had there not been guilt in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, there would have been no punishment. But since guilt preceded in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, punishment is inflicted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> without the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> fault, that his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, and that he may avoid future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, these two things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in satisfaction. For the work needs to be <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> may be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it must be a safeguard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that we may be preserved from future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the works of satisfaction are suitably enumerated?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the works of satisfaction are unsuitably enumerated by saying that there are three, viz. <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For a work of satisfaction should be penal. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not penal, since it is a remedy against penal sorrow, and is a source of pleasure, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse13">James 5:13</a>): "Is any of you sad? Let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should not be reckoned among the works of satisfaction.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is either carnal or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>. Now, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse28">Mark 9:28</a>, "This kind" of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> "can <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">go out</a> by nothing, but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>: Diseases of the body are healed by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, diseases of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." Therefore no other work of satisfaction is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, satisfaction is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order for us to be cleansed from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But almsgiving cleanses from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke 11:41</a>: "Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold all things are clean unto you." Therefore the other two are in excess.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, it seems that there should be more. For contrary heals contrary. But there are many more than three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore more works of satisfaction should be enumerated.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, pilgrimages and scourgings are also enjoined as works of satisfaction, and are not included among the above. Therefore they are not sufficiently enumerated.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Satisfaction should be of such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to involve something taken away from us for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now we have but three kinds of goods, bodily, <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, and goods of fortune, or external goods. By alms-deeds we deprive ourselves of some goods of fortune, and by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> we retrench goods of the body. As to goods of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is no need to deprive ourselves of any of them, either in whole or in part, since thereby we become acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but we should submit them entirely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is done by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>This number is shown to be suitable in so far as satisfaction uproots the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for these are reckoned to be three (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>), viz. "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh," "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes," and "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life." Fasting is directed against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the "flesh," alms-deeds against <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the "eyes," and "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>" against "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enarr. in Ps. 42).

<p>This number is also shown to be suitable in so far as satisfaction does not open a way to the suggestions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed either against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is prevented by "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>," or against our neighbor, and this is remedied by "<a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms-deeds</a>," or against ourselves, and this is forestalled by "<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to some, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is twofold. There is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of contemplatives whose "conversation is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>": and this, since it is altogether delightful, is not a work of satisfaction. The other is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which pours forth sighs for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; this is penal and a part of satisfaction.

<p>It may also be replied, and better, that every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has the character of satisfaction, for though it be sweet to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it is painful to the body, since, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Super Ezech., Hom. xiv), "doubtless, when our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> love is strengthened, our body's strength is weakened"; hence we read (<a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse25">Genesis 32:25</a>) that the sinew of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> thigh shrank through his wrestling with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is twofold; one which is completed in carnal delectation, as <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. and, another which is completed in things relating to the flesh, though it be completed in the delectation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than of the flesh, as <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Hence such like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are between <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, so that they need a satisfaction proper to them, viz. <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although each of these three, by a kind of likeness, is appropriated to some particular kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because it is reasonable that, whereby a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in that he should be punished, and that satisfaction should cut out the very root of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, yet each of them can satisfy for any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence if a man is unable to perform one of the above, another is imposed on him, chiefly <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, which can take the place of the others, in so far as in those to whom a man gives <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> he purchases other works of satisfaction thereby. Consequently even if almsgiving washes all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> away, it does not follow that other works are in excess.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Though there are many kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, all are reduced to those three roots or to those three kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to which, as we have said, the aforesaid works of satisfaction correspond.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Whatever relates to affliction of the body is all referred to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and whatever is spent for the benefit of one's neighbor is a kind of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and whatever act of worship is given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomes a kind of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so that even one work can be satisfactory in several ways.
