<h1>Question 15. The vices opposed to knowledge and understanding</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3015.htm#article1"> Is blindness of mind a sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3015.htm#article2"> Is dullness of sense a sin distinct from blindness of mind?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3015.htm#article3"> Do these vices arise from sins of the flesh?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether blindness of mind is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that blindness of mind is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Because, seemingly, that which excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not itself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now blindness of mind excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse41">John 9:41</a>): "If you were blind, you should not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Therefore blindness of mind is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, punishment differs from guilt. But blindness of mind is a punishment as appears from <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah 6:10</a>, "Blind the heart of this people," for, since it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it could not be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were it not a punishment. Therefore blindness of mind is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. xiv). Now blindness of mind is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x), "all love to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the resplendent <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," and as we read in <a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>, "the light is sweet and it is delightful for the eyes to see the sun." Therefore blindness of mind is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons blindness of mind among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arising from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as bodily blindness is the privation of the principle of bodily sight, so blindness of mind is the privation of the principle of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight. Now this has a threefold principle. One is the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which light, since it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is never forfeit from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and yet, at times, it is prevented from exercising its proper act, through being hindered by the lower powers which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> needs in order to understand, for instance in the case of imbeciles and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madmen</a>, as stated in I, 84, 7,8.

<p>Another principle of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight is a certain <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> light superadded to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which light is sometimes forfeit from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This privation is blindness, and is a punishment, in so far as the privation of the light of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is a punishment. Hence it is written concerning some (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse21">Wisdom 2:21</a>): "Their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> blinded them."

<p>A third principle of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight is an intelligible principle, through which a man understands other things; to which principle a man may attend or not attend. That he does not attend thereto happens in two ways. Sometimes it is due to the fact that a man's <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is deliberately turned away from the consideration of that principle, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse4">Psalm 35:4</a>, "He would not understand, that he might do well": whereas sometimes it is due to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being more busy about things which it loves more, so as to be hindered thereby from considering this principle, according to <a href="../bible/psa057.htm#verse9">Psalm 57:9</a>, "Fire," i.e. of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, "hath fallen on them and they shall not see the sun." On either of these ways blindness of mind is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The blindness that excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that which arises from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect of one who cannot see.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the second kind of blindness which is a punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, in itself, beloved by all; and yet, <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> it may be hateful to someone, in so far as a man is hindered thereby from having what he loves yet more.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether dulness of sense is a sin distinct from blindness of mind?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that dulness of sense is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from blindness of mind. Because one thing has one contrary. Now dulness is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. ii, 49); and so is blindness of mind, since understanding denotes a principle of sight. Therefore dulness of sense is the same as blindness of mind.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) in speaking of dulness describes it as "dullness of sense in respect of understanding." Now dulness of sense in respect of understanding seems to be the same as a defect in understanding, which pertains to blindness of mind. Therefore dulness of sense is the same as blindness of mind.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if they differ at all, it seems to be chiefly in the fact that blindness of mind is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), while dulness of sense is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect. But a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> defect is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so that, accordingly, dulness of sense would not be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is contrary to what <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45), where he reckons it among the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> arising from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Different <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> produce different effects. Now <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that dulness of sense arises from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, and that blindness of mind arises from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Now these others are different <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore those are different <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Dull is opposed to sharp: and a thing is said to be sharp because it can pierce; so that a thing is called dull through being obtuse and unable to pierce. Now a bodily sense, by a kind of metaphor, is said to pierce the medium, in so far as it perceives its object from a distance or is able by penetration as it were to perceive the smallest details or the inmost parts of a thing. Hence in corporeal things the senses are said to be acute when they can perceive a sensible object from afar, by sight, hearing, or scent, while on the other hand they are said to be dull, through being unable to perceive, except sensible objects that are near at hand, or of great power.

<p>Now, by way of similitude to bodily sense, we speak of sense in connection with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and this latter sense is in respect of certain primals and extremes, as stated in Ethic. vi, even as the senses are cognizant of sensible objects as of certain principles of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now this sense which is connected with understanding, does not perceive its object through a medium of corporeal distance, but through certain other media, as, for instance, when it perceives a thing's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> through a property thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through its effect. Consequently a man is said to have an acute sense in connection with his understanding, if, as soon as he apprehends a property or effect of a thing, he understands the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or the thing itself, and if he can succeed in perceiving its slightest details: whereas a man is said to have a dull sense in connection with his understanding, if he cannot arrive at <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about a thing, without many explanations; in which case, moreover, he is unable to obtain a perfect perception of everything pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that thing.

<p>Accordingly dulness of sense in connection with understanding denotes a certain weakness of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as to the consideration of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods; while blindness of mind implies the complete privation of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such things. Both are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding, whereby a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> goods by apprehending them, and has a subtle penetration of their inmost <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This dulness has the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as blindness of mind has, that is, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, as evidenced in one who, owing to his affection for carnal things, dislikes or neglects the careful consideration of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether blindness of mind and dulness of sense arise from sins of the flesh?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that blindness of mind and dulness of sense do not arise from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Retract. i, 4) retracts what he had said in his Soliloquies i, 1, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who didst wish none but the clean to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," and says that one might reply that "many, even those who are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> become <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> chiefly by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh. Therefore blindness of mind and dulness of sense are not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, blindness of mind and dulness of sense are defects in connection with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: whereas carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> pertain to the corruption of the flesh. But the flesh does not act on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but rather the reverse. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> blindness of mind and dulness of sense.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all things are more passive to what is near them than to what is remote. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are nearer the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> than carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are. Therefore blindness of mind and dulness of sense are <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> rather than by carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that dulness of sense arises from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and blindness of mind from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The perfect <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> consists in an abstraction from sensible phantasms, wherefore the more a man's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is freed from those phantasms, the more thoroughly will it be able to consider things intelligible, and to set in order all things sensible. Thus Anaxagoras stated that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> requires to be "detached" in order to command, and that the agent must have power over <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in order to be able to move it. Now it is evident that pleasure fixes a man's attention on that which he takes pleasure in: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 4,5) that we all do best that which we take pleasure in doing, while as to other things, we do them either not at all, or in a faint-hearted fashion.

<p>Now carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, are concerned with pleasures of touch in matters of food and sex; and these are the most impetuous of all pleasures of the body. For this reason these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> attention to be very firmly fixed on corporeal things, so that in consequence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> operation in regard to intelligible things is weakened, more, however, by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> than by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, forasmuch as sexual pleasures are more vehement than those of the table. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> gives rise to blindness of mind, which excludes almost entirely the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, while dulness of sense arises from <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, which makes a man weak in regard to the same intelligible things. On the other hand, the contrary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, viz. abstinence and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> very much to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> operation. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse17">Daniel 1:17</a>) that "to these children" on account of their abstinence and <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding in every book, and wisdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although some who are the slaves of carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are at times capable of subtle considerations about intelligible things, on account of the perfection of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> genius, or of some <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> superadded thereto, nevertheless, on account of the pleasures of the body, it must needs happen that their attention is frequently withdrawn from this subtle <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, but their <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is a clog on their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The flesh acts on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> faculties, not by altering them, but by impeding their operation in the aforesaid manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is owing to the fact that the carnal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are further removed from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that they distract the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> attention to more remote things, so that they hinder the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> all the more.
