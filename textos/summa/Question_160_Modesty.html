<h1>Question 160. Modesty</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3160.htm#article1"> Is modesty a part of temperance?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3160.htm#article2"> What is the matter of modesty?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether modesty is a part of temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that modesty is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For modesty is denominated from mode. Now mode is requisite in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Nat. Boni 3), "consists in mode, <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and order." Therefore modesty is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and consequently should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> would seem to be deserving of praise chiefly on account of its moderation. Now this gives modesty its name. Therefore modesty is the same as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and not one of its parts.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, modesty would seem to regard the correction of our neighbor, according to <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2 Timothy 2:24-25</a>, "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle, but be mild towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> . . . with modesty admonishing them that resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now admonishing wrong-doers is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, as stated above (Question 33, Article 1). Therefore seemingly modesty is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) reckons modesty as a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (141, 4; 157, 3), <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> brings moderation into those things wherein it is most difficult to be moderate, namely the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a> of pleasures of touch. Now whenever there is a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about some <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of very great moment, there must needs be another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about matters of lesser import: because the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> requires to be regulated by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> with regard to everything: thus it was stated above (134, 3, ad 1), that while magnificence is about great expenditure, there is need in addition for liberality, which is concerned with ordinary expenditure. Hence there is need for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to moderate other lesser matters where moderation is not so difficult. This <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is called modesty, and is annexed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> as its principal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a name is common to many it is sometimes appropriated to those of the lowest rank; thus the common name of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is appropriated to the lowest order of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. On the same way, mode which is observed by all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in common, is specially appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which prescribes the mode in the slightest things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Some things need tempering on account of their strength, thus we temper strong wine. But moderation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in all things: wherefore <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is more concerned with strong <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and modesty about weaker <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Modesty is to be taken there for the general moderation which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether modesty is only about outward actions?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that modesty is only about outward actions. For the inward movements of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> enjoins (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians 4:5</a>): "Let your modesty be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." Therefore modesty is only about outward actions.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are distinguished from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is about operations. Now modesty is seemingly one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore, if it be about outward works, it will not be concerned with inward <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no one same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is both about things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>--which is proper to the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--and about things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>--which is proper to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>--and again about things pertaining to the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> faculties. Therefore, if modesty be one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it cannot be about all these things.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> In all these things it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe the "mode" whence modesty takes its name. Therefore modesty is about all of them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), modesty differs from <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, in that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> moderates those matters where restraint is most difficult, while modesty moderates those that present less difficulty. Authorities seem to have had various opinions about modesty. For wherever they found a special kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or a special difficulty of moderation, they withdrew it from the province of modesty, which they confined to lesser matters. Now it is clear to all that the restraint of pleasures of touch presents a special difficulty: wherefore all distinguished <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> from modesty.

<p>In addition to this, moreover, Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) considered that there was a special kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the moderation of punishment; wherefore he severed clemency also from modesty, and held modesty to be about the remaining ordinary matters that require moderation. These seemingly are of four kinds. one is the movement of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> towards some excellence, and this is moderated by "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." The second is the desire of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and this is moderated by "studiousness" which is opposed to curiosity. The third regards bodily movements and actions, which require to be done becomingly and honestly [Cf. 145, 1], whether we act seriously or in play. The fourth regards outward show, for instance in dress and the like.

<p>To some of these matters, however, other authorities appointed certain special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: thus Andronicus [De Affectibus] mentions "meekness, simplicity, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>," and other kindred <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, of which we have spoken above (143); while <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Ethic. ii, 7) assigned <em>eutrapelia</em> to pleasures in games, as stated above (I-II, 60, 5). All these are comprised under modesty as understood by Tully; and in this way modesty regards not only outward but also inward actions.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> speaks of modesty as regarding externals. Nevertheless the moderation of the inner <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be shown by certain outward signs.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Various <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> assigned by various authorities are comprised under modesty. Wherefore nothing prevents modesty from regarding matters which require different <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Yet there is not so great a difference between the various parts of modesty, as there is between <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is about operations, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, which is about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, because in actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that present no great difficulty on the part of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but only on the part of moderation, there is but one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, one namely for each kind of moderation.

<p>Wherefore the Reply to the Third Objection also is clear.
