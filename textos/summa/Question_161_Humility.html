<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether humility is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> conveys the notion of a penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#verse18">Psalm 104:18</a>, "They <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> his feet in fetters." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are mutually opposed. Now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> seemingly denotes a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse23">Sirach 19:23</a>): "There is one that humbleth himself wickedly." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is opposed to another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is apparently opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of magnanimity, which aims at great things, whereas <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> shuns them. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is "the disposition of that which is perfect" (Phys. vii, text. 17). But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> seemingly belongs to the imperfect: wherefore it becomes not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, since He can be subject to none. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is about actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, according to Ethic. ii, 3. But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not reckoned by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that are about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, nor is it comprised under <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is about actions. Therefore it would seem not to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse48">Luke 1:48</a>, "He hath regarded the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of His handmaid," says (Hom. viii in Luc.): "One of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, is particularly commended in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>; for our Saviour said: 'Learn of Me, because I am meek, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart.'"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (I-II, 23, 2) when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has something attractive to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and likewise something repulsive to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely the difficulty of obtaining it. On respect of the former there arises the movement of hope, and in respect of the latter, the movement of <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Now it has been stated above (I-II, 61, 2) that for those <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> movements which are a kind of impulse towards an object, there is need of a moderating and restraining moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while for those which are a kind of recoil, there is need, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, of a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to strengthen it and urge it on. Wherefore a twofold <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> with regard to the difficult <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: one, to temper and restrain the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, lest it tend to high things immoderately; and this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: and another to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> against <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, and urge it on to the pursuit of great things according to right reason; and this is magnanimity. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> observes (Etym. x), "a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is so called because he is, as it were, 'humo acclinis'" [Literally, 'bent to the ground'], i.e. inclined to the lowest place. This may happen in two ways. First, through an extrinsic principle, for instance when one is cast down by another, and thus <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a punishment. Secondly, through an intrinsic principle: and this may be done sometimes well, for instance when a man, considering his own failings, assumes the lowest place according to his mode: thus <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to the Lord (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse27">Genesis 18:27</a>), "I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes." On this way <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Sometimes, however, this may be ill-done, for instance when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "not understanding his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, compares himself to senseless beasts, and becomes like to them" (<a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse13">Psalm 48:13</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated (ad 1), <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, in so far as it is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, conveys the notion of a praiseworthy self-abasement to the lowest place. Now this is sometimes done merely as to outward signs and pretense: wherefore this is "<a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>," of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in a letter (Ep. cxlix) that it is "grievous <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>," since to wit, it would seem to aim at excellence of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Sometimes, however, this is done by an inward movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in this way, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does not consist in externals, but chiefly in the inward choice of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Humility restrains the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> from aiming at great things against right reason: while magnanimity urges the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to great things in accord with right reason. Hence it is clear that magnanimity is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: indeed they concur in this, that each is according to right reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A thing is said to be perfect in two ways. First absolutely; such a thing contains no defect, neither in its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> nor in respect of anything else, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is perfect. To Him <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is fitting, not as regards His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only as regards His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly, a thing may be said to be perfect in a restricted sense, for instance in respect of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or state or time. Thus a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is perfect: although in comparison with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his perfection is found wanting, according to the word of <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse17">Isaiah 40:17</a>, "All nations are before Him as if they had no being at all." On this way <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> may be competent to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> intended to treat of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> as directed to civic life, wherein the subjection of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to another is defined according to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and consequently is a matter of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, considered as a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, regards chiefly the subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for Whose sake he <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself by subjecting himself to others.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether humility has to do with the appetite?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> concerns, not the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> but the judgment of reason. Because <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> concerns things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 22) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, when it extends outwardly to the body, is first of all shown in the eyes": wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/psa130.htm#verse1">Psalm 130:1</a>), "Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes lofty." Now eyes are the chief aids to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is chiefly concerned with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby one thinks little of oneself.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virginit. xxxi) that "almost the whole of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." Consequently nothing contained in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching admonishes us to seek the better things, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>, "Be zealous for the better <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>." Therefore it belongs to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to restrain not the desire of difficult things but the estimate thereof.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it belongs to the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> both to restrain excessive movement, and to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against excessive withdrawal: thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> both curbs daring and fortifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against fear. Now it is magnanimity that strengthens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against the difficulties that occur in the pursuit of great things. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> were to curb the desire of great things, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from magnanimity, which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is concerned, not with the desire but with the estimate of great things.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, Andronicus [De Affectibus] assigns <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to outward show; for he says that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of avoiding excessive expenditure and parade." Therefore it is not concerned with the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Poenit. [Serm. cccli]) that "the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who chooses to be an abject in the house of the Lord, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners." But choice concerns the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> has to do with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rather than with the estimative power.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, that a man restrain himself from being borne towards that which is above him. For this purpose he must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his disproportion to that which surpasses his capacity. Hence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one's own deficiency belongs to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, as a rule guiding the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> itself; and consequently it must be said that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, properly speaking, moderates the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lofty eyes are a sign of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, inasmuch as it excludes respect and fear: for fearing and respectful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are especially wont to lower the eyes, as though not daring to compare themselves with others. But it does not follow from this that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> concerned with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is contrary to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to aim at greater things through confiding in one's own powers: but to aim at greater things through confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; especially since the more one subjects oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more is one exalted in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virginit. xxxi): "It is one thing to raise oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another to raise oneself up against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He that abases himself before Him, him He raiseth up; he that raises himself up against Him, him He casteth down."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> there is the same reason for restraining daring and for strengthening the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against fear: since the reason in both cases is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should set the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of reason before dangers of death. But the reason for restraining presumptuous hope which pertains to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not the same as the reason for strengthening the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Because the reason for strengthening the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> is the acquisition of one's proper <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, render himself unworthy of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which was competent to him; while the chief reason for suppressing presumptuous hope is based on divine reverence, which shows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought not to ascribe to himself more than is competent to him according to the position in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has placed him. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> would seem to denote in the first place <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) ascribes <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, which he understands by <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a> of spirit, to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> reveres <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it follows that the relation of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to daring differs from that of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to hope. Because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> uses daring more than it suppresses it: so that excess of daring is more like <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> than lack of daring is. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> suppresses hope or confidence in self more than it uses it; wherefore excessive self-confidence is more opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> than lack of confidence is.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Excess in outward expenditure and parade is wont to be done with a view of boasting, which is suppressed by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> has to do, in a secondary way, with externals, as signs of the inward movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one ought not, by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, to subject oneself to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For, as stated above (2, ad 3), <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> consists chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now one ought not to offer to a man that which is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is the case with all acts of religious worship. Therefore, by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, one ought not to subject oneself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Gratia xxxiv): "Humility should take the part of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not of falsehood." Now some men are of the highest rank, who cannot, without falsehood, subject themselves to their inferiors. Therefore one ought not, by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, to subject oneself to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further no one ought to do that which conduces to the detriment of another's <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare. But if a man subject himself to another by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, this is detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to whom he subjects himself; for the latter might wax proud, or despise the other. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "Lest through excessive <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> the superior lose his authority." Therefore a man ought not, by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, to subject himself to all.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, let each esteem others better than themselves."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We may consider two things in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, namely that which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, and that which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>. Whatever pertains to defect is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>: but whatever pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> welfare and perfection is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse9">Hosea 13:9</a>, "Destruction is thy own, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; thy help is only in Me." Now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, as stated above (1, ad 5; 2, ad 3), properly regards the reverence whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in respect of that which is his own, ought to subject himself to every neighbor, in respect of that which the latter has of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>: but <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> does not require a man to subject what he has of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> to that which may seem to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> in another. For those who have a share of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they have them, according to <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>: "That we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Wherefore without prejudice to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> they may set the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> they have received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above those that others appear to have received from Him; thus the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a>): "(The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ) was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as it is now revealed to <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">His holy apostles</a>." On like manner. <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> does not require a man to subject that which he has of his own to that which his neighbor has of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>: otherwise each one would have to esteem himself a greater sinner than anyone else: whereas the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says without prejudice to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse15">Galatians 2:15</a>): "We by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, sinners." Nevertheless a man may esteem his neighbor to have some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which he lacks himself, or himself to have some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which another has not: by reason of which, he may subject himself to him with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We must not only revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, but also that which is His in each one, although not with the same measure of reverence as we revere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore we should subject ourselves with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to all our neighbors for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, according to <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse13">1 Peter 2:13</a>, "Be ye subject . . . to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake"; but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone do we owe the worship of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If we set what our neighbor has of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> above that which we have of our own, we cannot incur falsehood. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 71 on <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians 2:3</a>, "Esteem others better than themselves," says: "We must not esteem by pretending to esteem; but we should in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> think it possible for another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to have something that is hidden to us and whereby he is better than we are, although our own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whereby we are apparently better than he, be not hidden."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Humility, like other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, resides chiefly inwardly in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently a man, by an inward act of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, may subject himself to another, without giving the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> an occasion of detriment to his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare. This is what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> means in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "With fear, the superior should prostrate himself at your feet in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." On the other hand, due moderation must be observed in the outward acts of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> even as of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, lest they conduce to the detriment of others. If, however, a man does as he ought, and others take therefrom an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this is not imputed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who acts with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; since he does not give <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, although others take it.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether humility is a part of modesty or temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a part of modesty or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> regards chiefly the reverence whereby one is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now it belongs to a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> should be reckoned a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rather than a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or modesty.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> would seem to be in the irascible, just as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is opposed to it, and whose object is something difficult. Therefore apparently <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or modesty.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and magnanimity are about the same object, as stated above (1, ad 3). But magnanimity is reckoned a part, not of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> but of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as stated above (Question 129, Article 5). Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or modesty.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says (Hom. viii super Luc.): "If thou wilt hear the name of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and what it was called by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regards is the same as what they called <em>metriotes</em>, i.e. measure or moderation." Now this evidently pertains to modesty or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a part of modesty or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (137, 2, ad 1; 157, 3, ad 2), in assigning parts to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we consider chiefly the likeness that results from the mode of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the mode of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, whence it chiefly derives its praise, is the restraint or suppression of the impetuosity of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. Hence whatever <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> restrain or suppress, and the actions which moderate the impetuosity of the emotions, are reckoned parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Now just as meekness suppresses the movement of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> suppress the movement of hope, which is the movement of a spirit aiming at great things. Wherefore, like meekness, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is accounted a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 3) says that a man who aims at small things in proportion to his mode is not magnanimous but "temperate," and such a man we may call <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Moreover, for the reason given above (Question 160, Article 2), among the various parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, the one under which <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is comprised is modesty as understood by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54), inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is nothing else than a moderation of spirit: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse4">1 Peter 3:4</a>): "In the incorruptibility of a quiet and meek spirit."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, whose object is our last end, which is the first principle in matters of <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Hence the fact that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not prevent it from being a part of modesty or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Parts are assigned to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by reason of a sameness, not of subject or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, but of formal mode, as stated above (137, 2, ad 1; 157, 3, ad 2). Consequently, although <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is in the irascible as its subject, it is assigned as a part of modesty or <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> by reason of its mode.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and magnanimity agree as to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, they differ as to mode, by reason of which magnanimity is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether humility is the greatest of the virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, expounding the story of the Pharisee and the publican (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke 18</a>), says [Eclog. hom. vii de Humil. Animi.] that "if <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is such a fleet runner even when hampered by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it overtakes the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that is the companion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, whither will it not reach if you couple it with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>? It will stand among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is set above <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is either the most exalted of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, or includes all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. v, 1). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. [S. 10, C[1]): "Are you thinking of raising the great fabric of spirituality? Attend first of all to the foundation of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>." Now this would seem to imply that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is the foundation of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore apparently it is greater than the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> deserves the greater reward. Now the greatest reward is due to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, since "he that humbleth himself shall be exalted" (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. 16), "Christ's whole life on earth was a lesson in moral conduct through the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He assumed." Now He especially proposed His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> for our example, saying (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a>): "Learn of Me, because I am meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart." Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Pastor. iii, 1) that the "lesson proposed to us in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our redemption is the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> would seem to be the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> is set above all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse14">Colossians 3:14</a>, "Above all . . . things have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> pertains to the order of reason: which order is considered chiefly in reference to the end: wherefore the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are the greatest because they have the last end for their object. Secondarily, however, it is considered in reference to the ordering of the means to the end. This ordinance, as to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is in the reason itself from which it issues, but by participation it is in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> ordered by the reason; and this ordinance is the effect of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, especially of legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> makes a man a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> subject to ordinance of all kinds and in all matters; while every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has this effect in some special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Therefore after the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which regard the reason itself, and after <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, especially legal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> stands before all others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Humility is not set before <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but before that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is coupled with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and is no longer a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; even so, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pardoned through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: for it is said of the publican (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke 18:14</a>) that through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> "he went down into his house justified." Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [De incompr. Nat. Dei, Hom. v]: "Bring me a pair of two-horse chariots: in the one harness <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in the other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: and you will see that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> outrunning <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> wins not by its own strength, but by that of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: while you will see the other pair beaten, not by the weakness of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but by the weight and size of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as the orderly assembly of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is, by reason of a certain likeness, compared to a building, so again that which is the first step in the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is likened to the foundation, which is first laid before the rest of the building. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> infused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the first step in the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be understood in two ways. First by way of removing obstacles: and thus <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> holds the first place, inasmuch as it expels <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resisteth," and makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> submissive and ever open to receive the influx of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resisteth the proud, and giveth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>." On this sense <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is said to be the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> edifice. Secondly, a thing is first among <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> directly, because it is the first step towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the first step towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>, "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." On this sense <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the foundation in a more excellent way than <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To him that despises earthly things, heavenly things are promised: thus heavenly treasures are promised to those who despise earthly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, "Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth . . . but lay up to yourselves treasures in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Likewise heavenly consolations are promised to those who despise worldly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joys</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse5">Matthew 4:5</a>, "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." On the same way <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> uplifting is promised to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, not that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> alone <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> it, but because it is proper to it to despise earthly uplifting. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Poenit. [Serm. cccli]): "Think not that he who <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself remains for ever abased, for it is written: 'He shall be exalted.' And do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that his exaltation in men's eyes is effected by bodily uplifting."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The reason why <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> chiefly proposed <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to us, was because it especially removes the obstacle to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare consisting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> aiming at heavenly and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, in which he is hindered by striving to become great in earthly things. Hence <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, in order to remove an obstacle to our <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare, showed by giving an example of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, that outward exaltation is to be despised. Thus <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is, as it were, a disposition to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> untrammeled access to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and divine goods. Accordingly as perfection is greater than disposition, so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> approaches <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly, are greater than <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether twelve degrees of humility are fittingly distinguished in the Rule of the Blessed Benedict?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the twelve degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> that are set down in the Rule of the Blessed Benedict [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives these degrees in the reverse order to that followed by St. Benedict] are unfittingly distinguished. The first is to be "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> not only in heart, but also to show it in one's very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, one's eyes fixed on the ground"; the second is "to speak few and sensible words, and not to be loud of voice"; the third is "not to be easily moved, and disposed to laughter"; the fourth is "to maintain silence until one is asked"; the fifth is "to do nothing but to what one is exhorted by the common rule of the monastery"; the sixth is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and acknowledge oneself viler than all"; the seventh is "to think oneself worthless and unprofitable for all purposes"; the eighth is "to confess one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; the ninth is "to embrace patience by obeying under difficult and contrary circumstances"; the tenth is "to subject oneself to a superior"; the eleventh is "not to delight in fulfilling one's own desires"; the twelfth is "to fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to be always mindful of everything that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded." For among these there are some things pertaining to the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as obedience and patience. Again there are some that seem to involve a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion--and this is inconsistent with any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>--namely to declare oneself more despicable than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to confess and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> oneself to be in all ways worthless and unprofitable. Therefore these are unfittingly placed among the degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> proceeds from within to externals, as do other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore in the aforesaid degrees, those which concern outward actions are unfittingly placed before those which pertain to inward actions.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (De Simil. ci, seqq.) gives seven degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, the first of which is "to acknowledge oneself contemptible"; the second, "to grieve for this"; the third, "to confess it"; the fourth, "to convince others of this, that is to wish them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it"; the fifth, "to bear patiently that this be said of us"; the sixth, "to suffer oneself to be treated with contempt"; the seventh, "to love being thus treated." Therefore the aforesaid degrees would seem to be too numerous.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse15">Matthew 3:15</a> says: "Perfect <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> has three degrees. The first is to subject ourselves to those who are above us, and not to set ourselves above our equals: this is sufficient. The second is to submit to our equals, and not to set ourselves before our inferiors; this is called abundant <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. The third degree is to subject ourselves to inferiors, and in this is perfect righteousness." Therefore the aforesaid degrees would seem to be too numerous.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virginit. xxxi): "The measure of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is apportioned to each one according to his rank. It is imperiled by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, for the greater a man is the more liable is he to be entrapped." Now the measure of a man's greatness cannot be fixed according to a definite number of degrees. Therefore it would seem that it is not possible to assign the aforesaid degrees to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to do with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in so far as a man restrains the impetuosity of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from tending inordinately to great things: yet its rule is in the cognitive faculty, in that we should not deem ourselves to be above what we are. Also, the principle and origin of both these things is the reverence we bear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the inward disposition of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> leads to certain outward signs in words, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and gestures, which manifest that which is hidden within, as happens also with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For "a man is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his look, and a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when thou meetest him, by his countenance" (<a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse26">Sirach 19:26</a>). Wherefore the aforesaid degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> include something regarding the root of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, namely the twelfth degree, "that a man fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and bear all His commandments in mind."

<p>Again, they include certain things with regard to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, lest one aim inordinately at one's own excellence. This is done in three ways. First, by not following one's own will, and this pertains to the eleventh degree; secondly, by regulating it according to one's superior judgment, and this applies to the tenth degree; thirdly, by not being deterred from this on account of the difficulties and hardships that come in our way, and this belongs to the ninth degree.

<p>Certain things also are included referring to the estimate a man forms in acknowledging his own deficiency, and this in three ways. First by acknowledging and avowing his own shortcomings; this belongs to the eighth degree: secondly, by deeming oneself incapable of great things, and this pertains to the seventh degree: thirdly, that in this respect one should put others before oneself, and this belongs to the sixth degree.

<p>Again, some things are included that refer to outward signs. One of these regards <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, namely that in one's work one should not depart from the ordinary way; this applies to the fifth degree. Two others have reference to words, namely that one should not be in a hurry to speak, which pertains to the fourth degree, and that one be not immoderate in speech, which refers to the second. The others have to do with outward gestures, for instance in restraining haughty looks, which regards the first, and in outwardly checking laughter and other signs of senseless mirth, and this belongs to the third degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is possible, without falsehood, to deem and avow oneself the most despicable of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as regards the hidden faults which we acknowledge in ourselves, and the hidden <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which others have. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virginit. lii): "Bethink you that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are in some hidden way better than you, although outwardly you are better than they." Again, without falsehood one may avow and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> oneself in all ways unprofitable and useless in respect of one's own capability, so as to refer all one's sufficiency to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>, "Not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And there is nothing unbecoming in ascribing to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> those things that pertain to other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since, just as one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> arises from another, so, by a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sequence, the act of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> proceeds from the act of another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man arrives at <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> in two ways. First and chiefly by a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and in this way the inner <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> precedes the outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The other way is by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort, whereby he first of all restrains the outward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and afterwards succeeds in plucking out the inward root. It is according to this order that the degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> are here enumerated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> All the degrees mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> are reducible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, avowal, and desire of one's own abasement. For the first degree belongs to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of one's own deficiency; but since it would be wrong for one to love one's own failings, this is excluded by the second degree. The third and fourth degrees regard the avowal of one's own deficiency; namely that not merely one simply assert one's failing, but that one convince another of it. The other three degrees have to do with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which seeks, not outward excellence, but outward abasement, or bears it with equanimity, whether it consist of words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Regist. ii, 10, Ep. 36), "there is nothing great in being <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> towards those who treat us with regard, for even worldly people do this: but we should especially be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> towards those who make us suffer," and this belongs to the fifth and sixth degrees: or the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may even go so far as lovingly to embrace external abasement, and this pertains to the seventh degree; so that all these degrees are comprised under the sixth and seventh mentioned above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> These degrees refer, not to the thing itself, namely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, but to the degrees among men, who are either of higher or lower or of equal degree.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> This argument also considers the degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> not according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, in respect of which the aforesaid degrees are assigned, but according to the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.
