<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether pride is a sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the object of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> promise. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> promises refer to what He will do; and He is not the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is numbered among the Divine promises: for it is written (<a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse15">Isaiah 60:15</a>): "I will make thee to be an everlasting <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>'], a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unto generation and generation." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to wish to be like unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for every creature has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire for this; and especially does this become the rational creature which is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image and likeness. Now it is said in Prosper's Lib. Sent. 294, that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is love of one's own excellence, whereby one is likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is supremely excellent." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. ii, 6): "Pride imitates exaltedness; whereas Thou alone art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exalted over all." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed not only to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but also to a contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 8). But no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is found to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse14">Tobit 4:14</a>): "Never suffer <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to reign in thy mind or in thy words."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pride [superbia] is so called because a man thereby aims higher [supra] than he is; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be proud, because he wishes to appear above (super) what he really is"; for he who wishes to overstep beyond what he is, is proud. Now right reason requires that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will should tend to that which is proportionate to him. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> denotes something opposed to right reason, and this shows it to have the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Div. Nom. iv, 4), "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to be opposed to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>." Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Pride [superbia] may be understood in two ways. First, as overpassing [supergreditur] the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and in this sense we say that it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Secondly, it may simply denominate "super-abundance"; in which sense any super-abundant thing may be called <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: and it is thus that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promises <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as significant of super-abundant <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on the same passage (<a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse6">Isaiah 61:6</a>) says that "there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>"; or "a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists, and a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that denotes the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He bestows."

<p>It may also be replied that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> there signifies abundance of those things in which men may take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> has the direction of those things for which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; so that if the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> wander from the rule of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whether by excess or by default, it will be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, as is the case with the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for food which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desires <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for excellence in excess of right reason. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 13) that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the "desire for inordinate exaltation": and hence it is that, as he asserts (De Civ. Dei xiv, 13; xix, 12), "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> imitates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inordinately: for it hath equality of fellowship under Him, and wishes to usurp Hi. dominion over our fellow-creatures."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pride is directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, which, in a way, is concerned about the same <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as magnanimity, as stated above (161, 1, ad 3). Hence the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> by default is akin to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of pusillanimity, which is opposed by default to magnanimity. For just as it belongs to magnanimity to urge the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to great things against <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, so it belongs to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to withdraw the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from the inordinate desire of great things against presumption. Now pusillanimity, if we take it for a deficiency in pursuing great things, is properly opposed to magnanimity by default; but if we take it for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> attachment to things beneath what is becoming to a man, it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> by default; since each proceeds from a smallness of mind. On the same way, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may be opposed by excess, both to magnanimity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, from different points of view: to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, inasmuch as it scorns subjection, to magnanimity, inasmuch as it tends to great things inordinately. Since, however, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> implies a certain elation, it is more directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, even as pusillanimity, which denotes littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in tending towards great things, is more directly opposed to magnanimity.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether pride is a special sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxix) that "you will find no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not labelled <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>"; and Prosper says (De Vita Contempl. iii, 2) that "without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is, or was, or ever will be possible." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse17">Job 33:17</a>, "That He may withdraw <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'From the things that he is doing, and may deliver him from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>']," says that "a man prides himself when he transgresses His commandments by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now according to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [De Parad. viii], "every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and a disobedience of the heavenly commandments." Therefore every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is opposed to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 23): "Pride is by no means content with the destruction of one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; it raises itself up against all the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and like an all-pervading and poisonous disease corrupts the whole body"; and <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. [De Summo Bono ii, 38) that it is "the downfall of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has a special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> has a general <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 23) that "one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of his gold, another of his eloquence: one is elated by mean and earthly things, another by sublime and heavenly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a special but a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxix): "If he look into the question carefully, he will find that, according to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a very different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>." Now the genus is not different from its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a general but a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may be considered in two ways. First with regard to its proper <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which it has under the aspect of its proper object. On this way <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because it has a special object: for it is inordinate desire of one's own excellence, as stated (1, ad 2). Secondly, it may be considered as having a certain influence towards other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. On this way it has somewhat of a generic character, inasmuch as all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may arise from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in two ways. First directly, through other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> being directed to the end of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which is one's own excellence, to which may be directed anything that is inordinately desired. Secondly, indirectly and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> as it were, that is by removing an obstacle, since <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> makes a man despise the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> which hinders him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse20">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, "Thou hast broken My yoke, thou hast burst My bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve."

<p>It must, however, be observed that this generic character of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> admits of the possibility of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> arising from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> sometimes, but it does not imply that all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> originate from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> always. For though one may break the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> by any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through contempt which pertains to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, yet one does not always break the Divine commandments through contempt, but sometimes through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. and sometimes through weakness: and for this reason <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xxix) that "many things are done amiss which are not done through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These words are introduced by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> into his book De Nat. et Grat., not as being his own, but as those of someone with whom he is arguing. Hence he subsequently disproves the assertion, and shows that not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. We might, however, reply that these authorities must be understood as referring to the outward effect of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, namely the breaking of the commandments, which applies to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not to the inward act of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, namely contempt of the commandment. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed, not always through contempt, but sometimes through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, sometimes through weakness, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may sometimes commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> effectively, but not affectively; thus he who, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, slays his father, is a parricide effectively, but not affectively, since he did not intend it. Accordingly he who breaks <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandment is said to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> himself against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, effectively always, but not always affectively.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may destroy a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in two ways. On one way by direct contrariety to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and thus <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> does not corrupt every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; even as every special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroys the special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> opposed to it, by acting counter thereto. On another way a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> destroys a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by making ill use of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and thus <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> destroys every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in so far as it finds an occasion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, just as in everything else pertaining to excellence. Hence it does not follow that it is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Pride regards a special aspect in its object, which aspect may be found in various matters: for it is inordinate love of one's excellence, and excellence may be found in various things.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the subject of pride is the irascible faculty?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the subject of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the irascible faculty. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxiii, 17): "A swollen mind is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for the swelling shuts out the light." Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pertains, not to the irascible but to the rational faculty. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not in the irascible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxiv, 8) that "the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> observe other people's conduct not so as to set themselves beneath them with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, but so as to set themselves above them with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>": wherefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> originates in undue observation. Now observation pertains not to the irascible but to the rational faculty.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further. <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seeks pre-eminence not only in sensible things, but also in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and intelligible things: while it consists <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> in the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>, "The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now the irascible, since it is a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, cannot extend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and things intelligible. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> cannot be in the irascible.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as stated in Prosper's Liber Sententiarum, sent. 294, "Pride is love of one's own excellence." But love is not in the irascible, but in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not in the irascible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. ii, 49) opposes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear. Now fear belongs to the irascible. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is in the irascible.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The subject of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is to be ascertained from its proper object: for the object of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> or act cannot be other than the object of the power, which is the subject of both. Now the proper object of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is something difficult, for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the desire of one's own excellence, as stated above (1 and 2). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> must needs pertain in some way to the irascible faculty. Now the irascible may be taken in two ways. First in a strict sense, and thus it is a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, strictly speaking, is a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Secondly, the irascible may be taken in a broader sense, so as to belong also to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, to which also <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is sometimes ascribed. It is thus that we attribute <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, but as denoting the sentence of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pronouncing judgment. Nevertheless the irascible understood in this broad sense is not distinct from the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> power, as stated above in I, 59, 4; I-II, 82, 5, ad 1 and 2.

<p>Consequently if the difficult thing which is the object of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, were merely some sensible object, whereto the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> might tend, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> would have to be in the irascible which is part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But since the difficult thing which <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> has in view is common both to sensible and to <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, we must needs say that the subject of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the irascible not only strictly so called, as a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but also in its wider acceptation, as applicable to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is ascribed also to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is twofold. One is purely speculative, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> hinders this indirectly by removing its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subjects not his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from Him, according to <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse25">Matthew 11:25</a>, "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>," i.e. from the proud, who are wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in their own eyes, "and hast revealed them to little ones," i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.

<p>Nor does he deign to learn anything from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whereas it is written (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse34">Sirach 6:34</a>): "If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt receive instruction." The other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is affective, and this is directly hindered by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because the proud, through delighting in their own excellence, disdain the excellence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxiii, 17) that "the proud, although certain hidden <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> be conveyed to their understanding, cannot realize their sweetness: and if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of them they cannot relish them." Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse2">Proverbs 11:2</a>): "Where <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is there also is wisdom."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (161, 2, 6), <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> observes the rule of right reason whereby a man has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> self-esteem. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> does not observe this rule of right reason, for he esteems himself greater than he is: and this is the outcome of an inordinate desire for his own excellence, since a man is ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what he desires very much, the result being that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is borne towards things higher than what become him. Consequently whatsoever things lead a man to inordinate self-esteem lead him to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: and one of those is the observing of other people's failings, just as, on the other hand, in the words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxiii, 17), "<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, by a like observation of other people's <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, set others above themselves." Accordingly the conclusion is not that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is in the rational faculty, but that one of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> is in the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pride is in the irascible, not only as a part of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, but also as having a more general signification, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9), "love precedes all other emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and is their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," wherefore it may be employed to denote any of the other emotions. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is said to be "love of one's own excellence," inasmuch as love makes a man presume inordinately on his superiority over others, and this belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether the four species of pride are fittingly assigned by Gregory?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the four <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> are unfittingly assigned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, who says (Moral. xxiii, 6): "There are four marks by which every kind of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the arrogant betrays itself; either when they think that their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is from themselves, or if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to be from above, yet they think that it is due to their own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; or when they boast of having what they have not, or despise others and wish to appear the exclusive possessors of what they have." For <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> distinct from unbelief, just as <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is a distinct <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now it pertains to unbelief, if a man deem that he has not received his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that he has the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. Therefore this should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the same thing should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of different genera. Now boasting is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of lying, as stated above (110, 2; 112). Therefore it should not be accounted a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, some other things apparently pertain to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which are not mentioned here. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Reference unknown] says that "nothing is so indicative of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as to show oneself ungrateful": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 14) that "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to excuse oneself of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one has committed." Again, presumption whereby one aims at having what is above one, would seem to have much to do with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore the aforesaid division does not sufficiently account for the different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, we find other divisions of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For Anselm [<a href="../cathen/05224a.htm">Eadmer</a>, De Similit. xxii, seqq.] divides the uplifting of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, saying that there is "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of will, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of speech, end <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>." <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> [De Grad. Humil. et Superb. x, seqq.] also reckons twelve degrees of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, namely "curiosity, frivolity of mind, senseless mirth, boasting, singularity, arrogance, presumption, defense of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, deceitful confession, rebelliousness, license, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>." Now these apparently are not comprised under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>. Therefore the latter would seem to be assigned unfittingly.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The authority of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> suffices.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1 and 2,3), <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> denotes immoderate desire of one's own excellence, a desire, to wit, that is not in accord with right reason. Now it must be observed that all excellence results from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> possessed. Such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may be considered in three ways. First, in itself. For it is evident that the greater the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that one has, the greater the excellence that one derives from it. Hence when a man ascribes to himself a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> greater than what he has, it follows that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to his own excellence in a measure exceeding his competency: and thus we have the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, namely "boasting of having what one has not."

<p>Secondly, it may be considered with regard to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as to have a thing of oneself is more excellent than to have it of another. Hence when a man esteems the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he has received of another as though he had it of himself, the result is that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is borne towards his own excellence immoderately. Now one is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in two ways, efficiently and meritoriously: and thus we have the first two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, namely "when a man thinks he has from himself that which he has from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," or "when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that which he has received from above to be due to his own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>."

<p>Thirdly, it may be considered with regard to the manner of having it, in so far as a man obtains greater excellence through possessing some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> more excellently than other men; the result again being that his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is borne inordinately towards his own excellence: and thus we have the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is "when a man despises others and wishes to be singularly conspicuous."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment may be destroyed in two ways. First, universally: and thus in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment is destroyed by unbelief. Secondly, in some particular <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of choice, and unbelief does not do this. Thus a man who commits fornication, judges that for the time being it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him to commit fornication; yet he is not an unbeliever, as he would be, were he to say that universally fornication is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is thus in the question in point: for it pertains to unbelief to assert universally that there is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, whereas, properly speaking, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and not to unbelief, through inordinate desire of one's own excellence, to boast of one's goods as though one had them of oneself, or of one's own <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Boasting is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of lying, as regards the outward act whereby a man <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribes to himself what he has not: but as regards the inward arrogance of the heart it is reckoned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The ungrateful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ascribes to himself what he has from another: wherefore the first two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> pertain to ingratitude. To excuse oneself of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> one has committed, belongs to the third <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since by so doing a man ascribes to himself the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of innocence which he has not. To aim presumptuously at what is above one, would seem to belong chiefly to the fourth <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, which consists in wishing to be preferred to others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The three mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> correspond to the progress of any particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for it begins by being conceived in thought, then is uttered in word, and thirdly is accomplished in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>.

<p>The twelve degrees mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard</a> are reckoned by way of opposition to the twelve degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, of which we have spoken above (Question 161, Article 6). For the first degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is to "be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in heart, and to show it in one's very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, one's eyes fixed on the ground": and to this is opposed "curiosity," which consists in looking around in all directions curiously and inordinately. The second degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to speak few and sensible words, and not to be loud of voice": to this is opposed "frivolity of mind," by which a man is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of speech. The third degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "not to be easily moved and disposed to laughter," to which is opposed "senseless mirth." The fourth degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to maintain silence until one is asked," to which is opposed "boasting". The fifth degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to do nothing but to what one is exhorted by the common rule of the monastery," to which is opposed "singularity," whereby a man wishes to seem more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> than others. The sixth degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and acknowledge oneself viler than all," to which is opposed "arrogance," whereby a man sets himself above others. The seventh degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to think oneself worthless and unprofitable for all purposes," to which is opposed "presumption," whereby a man thinks himself capable of things that are above him. The eighth degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "to confess one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," to which is opposed "defense of one's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." The ninth degree is "to embrace patience by obeying under difficult and contrary circumstances," to which is opposed "deceitful confession," whereby a man being unwilling to be punished for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> confesses them deceitfully. The tenth degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "obedience," to which is opposed "rebelliousness." The eleventh degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "not to delight in fulfilling one's own desires"; to this is opposed "license," whereby a man delights in doing freely whatever he will. The last degree of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>": to this is opposed "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>," which implies contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>In these twelve degrees not only are the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> indicated, but also certain things that precede and follow them, as we have stated above with regard to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> (161, 6).

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether pride is a mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse4">Psalm 7:4</a>, "O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I have done this thing," says: "Namely, the universal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." Therefore if <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> were a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so would every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is apparently not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, neither as to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor as to the love of one's neighbor, because the excellence which, by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, one desires inordinately, is not always opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, or our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; on the contrary, it arises therefrom, for as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 23), "sometimes a man is elated by sublime and heavenly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xxxiv, 23) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a most evident sign of the reprobate, and contrariwise, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>." But men do not become reprobate on account of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not a venial but a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Pride is opposed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> properly regards the subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (161, 1, ad 5). Hence <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> properly regards lack of this subjection, in so far as a man raises himself above that which is appointed to him according to the Divine rule or measure, against the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 10:13</a>), "But we will not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath measured to us." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>): "The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" because, to wit, the root of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is found to consist in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not being, in some way, subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His rule. Now it is evident that not to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this consists in turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and consequently <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is, of its genus, a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nevertheless just as in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are mortal by their genus (for instance fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>) there are certain motions that are venial by reason of their imperfection (through forestalling the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and being without its consent), so too in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> it happens that certain motions of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when reason does not consent to them.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>) <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a general <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but by a kind of influence, in so far as all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may have their origin in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Hence it does not follow that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are mortal, but only such as arise from perfect <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which we have stated to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pride is always contrary to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not subject himself to the Divine rule as he ought. Sometimes it is also contrary to the love of our neighbor; when, namely, a man sets himself inordinately above his neighbor: and this again is a transgression of the Divine rule, which has established order among men, so that one ought to be subject to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Pride arises from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not as from its direct <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but as from an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in so far as a man makes a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> an occasion for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. And nothing prevents one contrary from being the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of another, as stated in Phys. viii, 1. Hence some are even <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether pride is the most grievous of sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the more difficult a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to avoid, the less grievous it would seem to be. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is most difficult to avoid; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi), "Other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> find their vent in the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> lies in wait for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to destroy them." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "The greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is opposed to the greater <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (Ethic. viii, 10). Now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to which <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is opposed is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated above (Question 61, Article 5). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that are opposed to greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as unbelief, <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and so forth, are more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not punished by a lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is sometimes punished by other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans 1:28</a>, where it is stated that on account of their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart, men of science were delivered "to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse51">Psalm 118:51</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> did iniquitously," says: "The greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Two things are to be observed in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, conversion to a mutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this is the material part of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and aversion from the immutable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and this gives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> its formal aspect and complement. Now on the part of the conversion, there is no reason for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> being the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because uplifting which <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> covets inordinately, is not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> most incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But on the part of the aversion, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> has extreme gravity, because in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turns away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or through weakness, or through desire for any other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> whatever; whereas <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> denotes aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> simply through being unwilling to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His rule. Hence <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> [Cf. Cassian, de Caenob. Onst. xii, 7 says that "while all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> flee from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> alone withstands <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; for which reason it is specially stated (<a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resisteth the proud." Wherefore aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His commandments, which is a consequence as it were in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, belongs to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for its act is the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since that which belongs to a thing by its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is always of greater weight than that which belongs to it through something else, it follows that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by its genus, because it exceeds in aversion which is the formal complement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is difficult to avoid in two ways. First, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of its onslaught; thus <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> in its onslaught on account of its impetuosity; and "still more difficult is it to resist <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, on account of its connaturality," as stated in Ethic. ii, 3,9. A difficulty of this kind in avoiding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> diminishes the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because a man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the more grievously, according as he yields to a less impetuous <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 12,15).

<p>Secondly, it is difficult to avoid a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on account of its being hidden. On this way it is difficult to avoid <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, since it takes occasion even from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as stated (5, ad 3). Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says pointedly that it "lies in wait for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>"; and it is written (<a href="../bible/psa141.htm#verse4">Psalm 141:4</a>): "In the way wherein I walked, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> [Cf. <a href="../bible/psa139.htm#verse6">Psalm 139:6</a>, 'The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> have hidden a net for me.'] [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'they'] have hidden a snare for me." Hence no very great gravity attaches to the movement of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> while creeping in secretly, and before it is discovered by the judgment of reason: but once discovered by reason, it is easily avoided, both by considering one's own infirmity, according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach 10:9</a>, "Why is earth and ashes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>?" and by considering <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> greatness, according to <a href="../bible/job015.htm#verse13">Job 15:13</a>, "Why doth thy spirit swell against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" as well as by considering the imperfection of the goods on which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prides himself, according to <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah 40:6</a>, "All flesh is grass, and all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> thereof as the flower of the field"; and farther on (<a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse6">Isaiah 64:6</a>), "all our justices" are become "like the rag of a menstruous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Opposition between a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is inferred from the object, which is considered on the part of conversion. On this way <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> has no claim to be the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as neither has <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> to be the greatest of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But it is the greatest on the part of aversion, since it brings greatness upon other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For unbelief, by the very fact of its arising out of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> contempt, is rendered more grievous than if it be the outcome of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness. The same applies to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> and the like.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as in syllogisms that lead to an impossible conclusion one is sometimes convinced by being faced with a more evident absurdity, so too, in order to overcome their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes certain men by allowing them to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, which though they be less grievous are more evidently shameful. Hence <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (De Summo Bono ii, 38) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the worst of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; whether because it is appropriate to those who are of highest and foremost rank, or because it originates from just and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so that its guilt is less perceptible. on the other hand, carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is apparent to all, because from the outset it is of a shameful <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and yet, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dispensation, it is less grievous than <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For he who is in the clutches of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and feels it not, falls into the lusts of the flesh, that being thus <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> he may rise from his abasement."

<p>From this indeed the gravity of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is made manifest. For just as a wise physician, in order to cure a worse disease, allows the patient to contract one that is less dangerous, so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is shown to be more grievous by the very fact that, as a remedy, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> allows men to fall into other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether pride is the first sin of all?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all. For the first is maintained in all that follows. Now <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> does not accompany all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor is it the origin of all: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Nat. et Grat. xx) that many things are done "amiss which are not done with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse14">Sirach 10:14</a>) that the "beginning of . . . <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is to fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore falling away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the order of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would seem to be according to the order of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Now, not <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the first of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of all.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 3:13</a>): "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> men and seducers shall grow worse and worse"; so that apparently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> beginning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is not the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as stated in the foregoing Article. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, resemblance and pretense come after the reality. Now the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iii, 7) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> apes <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and daring." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of daring precedes the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>): "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The first thing in every genus is that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a>. Now it has been stated above (<a href="#6">Article 6</a>) that aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the formal complement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, belongs to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, and to other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, consequently. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> fulfils the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of a first thing, and is "the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," as stated above (I-II, 84, 2), when we were treating of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of the aversion which is the chief part of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Pride is said to be "the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," not as though every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> originated from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but because any kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> liable to arise from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> To fall off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, not as though it were a distinct <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but as being the first part of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For it has been said above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>) that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> regards chiefly subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which it scorns, and in consequence it scorns to be subject to a creature for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There is no need for the order of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to be the same as that of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is corruptive of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now that which is first to be generated is the last to be corrupted. Wherefore as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the first of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so unbelief is the last of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to which sometimes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is led by other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa136.htm#verse7">Psalm 136:7</a>, "Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof," says that "by heaping <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> upon <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> a man will lapse into unbelief," and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse19">1 Timothy 1:19</a>) that "some rejecting a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> have made shipwreck concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Pride is said to be the most grievous of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> because that which gives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> its gravity is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of gravity in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Accordingly previous to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> there may be certain less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are committed through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or weakness. But among the grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the first is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereby other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are rendered more grievous. And as that which is the first in <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causing</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is the last in the withdrawal from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse13">Psalm 18:13</a>, "I shall be cleansed from the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," says: "Namely from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is the last in those who return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the first in those who withdraw from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> associates <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with feigned <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, not that it consists precisely in this, but because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thinks he is more likely to be uplifted before men, if he seem to be daring or brave.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether pride should be reckoned a capital vice?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> should be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> [Comment. in Deut. xvi] and Cassian [De Inst. Caenob. v, 1: Collat. v, 2 number <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is apparently the same as vainglory, since both covet excellence. Now vainglory is reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> also should be reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Virginit. xxxi) that "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> begets <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, nor is it ever without this companion." Now <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is reckoned a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as stated above (Question 36, Article 4). Much more therefore is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 45) does not include <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (A2,5, ad 1) <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may be considered in two ways; first in itself, as being a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; secondly, as having a general influence towards all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are said to be certain special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which many kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> arise. Wherefore some, considering <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in the light of a special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, numbered it together with the other capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, taking into consideration its general influence towards all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as explained above (2, Objection 3), did not place it among the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, but held it to be the "queen and mother of all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>." Hence he says (Moral. xxxi, 45): "Pride, the queen of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, when it has vanquished and captured the heart, forthwith delivers it into the hands of its lieutenants the seven principal <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, that they may despoil it and produce <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of all kinds."

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Pride is not the same as vainglory, but is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thereof: for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> covets excellence inordinately: while vainglory covets the outward show of excellence.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, which is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, arises from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but that it is still more principal than the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> themselves.
