<h1>Question 163. The first man's sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3163.htm#article1"> Was pride the first man's first sin?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3163.htm#article2"> What the first man coveted by sinning</a> <li><a href="../summa/3163.htm#article3"> Was his sin more grievous than all other sins?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3163.htm#article4"> Which sinned more grievously, the man or the woman?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether pride was the first man's first sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was not the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans 5:19</a>) that "by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> many were made sinners." Now the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the one by which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were made sinners in the point of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Therefore disobedience, and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says, <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse3">Luke 4:3</a>, "And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> said to Him," that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> observed the same order as in overcoming the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was first tempted to <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew 4:3</a>, where it was said to Him: "If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread." Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> but <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> suggestion. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> promised him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis 3:5</a>). Therefore inordinateness in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was through the desire of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which pertains to curiosity. Therefore curiosity, and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Gen. ad lit. xi] on <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 2:14</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> was in the transgression," says: "The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> rightly calls this seduction, for they were persuaded to accept a falsehood as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; namely that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had forbidden them to touch that tree, because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that if they touched it, they would be like gods, as though He who made them men, begrudged them the godhead . . ." Now it pertains to unbelief to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such a thing. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was unbelief and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>): "Pride is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>, "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Many movements may concur towards one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the character of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> attaches to that one in which inordinateness is first found. And it is evident that inordinateness is in the inward movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before being in the outward act of the body; since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei i, 18), the sanctity of the body is not forfeited so long as the sanctity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains. Also, among the inward movements, the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved towards the end before being moved towards that which is desired for the sake of the end; and consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was where it was possible for his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to be directed to an inordinate end. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was so appointed in the state of innocence, that there was no rebellion of the flesh against the spirit. Wherefore it was not possible for the first inordinateness in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> to result from his coveting a sensible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh tends against the order of reason. It remains therefore that the first inordinateness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> resulted from his coveting inordinately some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now he would not have <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> it inordinately, by desiring it according to his measure as established by the Divine rule. Hence it follows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consisted in his coveting some <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> above his measure: and this pertains to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> disobedience to the Divine command was not willed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for his own sake, for this could not happen unless one presuppose inordinateness in his will. It remains therefore that he willed it for the sake of something else. Now the first thing he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> inordinately was his own excellence; and consequently his disobedience was the result of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. This agrees with the statement of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who says (Ad Oros [Dial. QQ. lxv, qu. 4) that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> obeyed the serpent's prompting, and scorned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commands."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Gluttony also had a place in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents. For it is written (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis 3:6</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold, and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat." Yet the very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and beauty of the fruit was not their first motive for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, but the persuasive words of the serpent, who said (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis 3:5</a>): "Your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods": and it was by coveting this that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> resulted from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> resulted in our first parents from their inordinate desire for excellence. Hence the serpent began by saying: "You shall be as Gods," and added: "Knowing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30), "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the serpent's statement that they were debarred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and useful thing, were her mind not already filled with the love of her own power, and a certain <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> self-presumption." This does not mean that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> preceded the promptings of the serpent, but that as soon as the serpent had spoken his words of persuasion, her mind was puffed up, the result being that she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> to have spoken <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the first man's pride consisted in his coveting God's likeness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> did not consist in his coveting the Divine likeness. For no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by coveting that which is competent to him according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness is competent to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>): "Let us make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to our image and likeness." Therefore he did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness in order that he might obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for this was the serpent's suggestion: "You shall be as Gods <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Now the desire of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> at the beginning of his Metaphysics i, 1: "All men <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Therefore he did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chooses the impossible. Now the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was endowed with wisdom, according to <a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse5">Sirach 17:5</a>, "He filled them with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of understanding." Since then every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists in a deliberate act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely choice, it would seem that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by coveting something impossible. But it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse11">Exodus 15:11</a>, "Who is like to Thee among the strong, O Lord?" Therefore the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse5">Psalm 68:5</a> [Enarr. in Ps. 68, "Then did I restore [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'pay'] that which I took not away," says: "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Eve wished to rob the Godhead and they lost <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> likeness is twofold. One is a likeness of absolute equality [Cf. I, 93, 1: and such a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our first parents did not covet, since such a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not conceivable to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, especially of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>The other is a likeness of imitation, such as is possible for a creature in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as the creature participates somewhat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness according to its measure. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. ix): "The same things are like and unlike to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; like, according as they imitate Him, as far as He can be imitated; unlike, according as an effect falls short of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." Now every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in a creature is a participated likeness of the first <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p>Wherefore from the very fact that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> above his measure, as stated in the foregoing Article, it follows that he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness inordinately.

<p>It must, however, be observed that the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a thing not possessed. Now <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, in so far as the rational creature participates in the Divine likeness, may be considered in reference to three things. First, as to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being: and this likeness was imprinted from the very outset of their creation, both on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "to His image and likeness"--and on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 28:12</a>): "Thou wast the seal of resemblance." Secondly, as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and this likeness was bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> at his creation, wherefore immediately after the words just quoted, "Thou wast the seal of resemblance," we read: "Full of wisdom." But the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, at his creation, had not yet received this likeness actually but only in <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a>. Thirdly, as to the power of operation: and neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> nor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> received this likeness actually at the very outset of his creation, because to each there remained something to be done whereby to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>Accordingly, while both (namely the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>) <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness inordinately, neither of them <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by coveting a likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> chiefly by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness as regards "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>," according to the serpent's instigation, namely that by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power he might decide what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and what was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for him to do; or again that he should of himself foreknow what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would befall him. Secondarily he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness as regards his own power of operation, namely that by his own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power he might act so as to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that "the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> mind was filled with love of her own power." On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by coveting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness, as regards power. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 13) that "he wished to enjoy his own power rather than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>." Nevertheless both <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> somewhat to be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in so far as each wished to rely on himself in contempt of the order of the Divine rule.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the likeness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by coveting this, as stated.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to covet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, absolutely; but to covet this likeness inordinately, that is, above one's measure, this is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> commenting on <a href="../bible/psa070.htm#verse18">Psalm 70:18</a>, "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is like Thee?" says: "He who desires to be of himself, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is of no one, wishes wickedly to be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus did the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who was unwilling to be subject to Him, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who refused to be, as a servant, bound by His command."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument considers the likeness of equality.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the sin of our first parents was more grievous than other sins?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents was more grievous than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15): "Great was the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, when it was so easy to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Now it was very easy for our first parents to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they had nothing within them urging them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents was more grievous than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, punishment is proportionate to guilt. Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents was most severely punished, since by it "death entered into this world," as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>). Therefore that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more grievous than other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the first in every genus is seemingly the greatest (Metaph. ii, 4 [Ed. Diel. i, 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents was the first among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Therefore it was the greatest.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says [Peri Archon i, 3: "I think that a man who stands on the highest step of perfection cannot fail or fall suddenly: this can happen only by degrees and little by little." Now our first parents were established on the highest and perfect grade. Therefore their first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not the greatest of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> There is a twofold gravity to be observed in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. one results from the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thus we say that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is a graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than simple fornication. The other gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> results from some circumstance of place, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or time. The former gravity is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and is of greater moment: hence a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is said to be grave in respect of this gravity rather than of the other. Accordingly we must say that the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not graver than all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For though <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, of its genus, has a certain pre-eminence over other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> whereby one denies or blasphemes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> whereby one covets <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness inordinately, such as the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of our first parents, as stated (2).

<p>But if we consider the circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was most grave on account of the perfection of their state. We must accordingly conclude that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was most grievous relatively but not simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument considers the gravity of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as resulting from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the sinner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The severity of the punishment awarded to that first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> corresponds to the magnitude of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not as regards its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> but as regards its being the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: because it destroyed the innocence of our original state, and by robbing it of innocence brought disorder upon the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Where things are directly subordinate, the first must needs be the greatest. Such is not the order among <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for one follows from another <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. And thus it does not follow that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the greatest.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Adam's sin was more grievous than Eve's?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more grievous than Eve's. For it is written (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 2:14</a>): "<a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> was in the transgression": and so it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through assured <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now the latter is the graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke 12:47-48</a>, "That servant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord . . . and did not according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes: but he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." Therefore <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more grievous than Eve's.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Decem Chordis 3 [Serm. ix; xcvi de Temp.]): "If the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the head, he should live better, and give an example of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to his wife, that she may imitate him." Now he who ought to do better, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more grievously, if he commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously than Eve.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would seem to be the most grievous. Now <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, apparently, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because while <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> he relied on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy [Cf. 21, 2, Objection 3]. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is evidently alluding to the words of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> quoted there], and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of presumption. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously than Eve.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Punishment corresponds to guilt. Now the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was more grievously punished than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen003.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Therefore she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated (3), the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends on the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> rather than on a circumstance of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly we must assert that, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the more grievous, because he was more perfect than the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p>As regards the genus itself of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of each is considered to be equal, for each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 35): "Eve in excusing herself betrays disparity of sex, though parity of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>."

<p>But as regards the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> more grievously, for three reasons. First, because she was more puffed up than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the serpent's persuasive words, namely that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had forbidden them to eat of the tree, lest they should become like to Him; so that in wishing to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness by eating of the forbidden fruit, her <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> rose to the height of desiring to obtain something against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; wherefore he did not wish to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> likeness against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will: but his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> consisted in wishing to attain thereto by his own power. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> not only herself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but suggested <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; wherefore she <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and her neighbor. Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was diminished by the fact that, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 42), "he consented to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of a certain friendly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>-will, on account of which a man sometimes will offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than make an enemy of his friend. That he ought not to have done so is shown by the just issue of the Divine sentence."

<p>It is therefore evident that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was deceived because she was first of all puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Wherefore her <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> did not excuse, but aggravated her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in so far as it was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of her being puffed up with still greater <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This argument considers the circumstance of personal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, on account of which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reliance on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy did not reach to contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi [De Civ. Dei xiv, 11), it was due to the fact that, "having had no experience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> severity, he thought the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be venial," i.e. easily forgiven [Cf. I-II, 89, 3, ad 1].
