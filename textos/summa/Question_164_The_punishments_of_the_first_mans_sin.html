<h1>Question 164. The punishments of the first man's sin</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3164.htm#article1"> Death, which is the common punishment</a> <li><a href="../summa/3164.htm#article2"> The other particular punishments mentioned in Genesis</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether death is the punishment of our first parents' sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that death is not the punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For that which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be called a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but vitiates it. Now death is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and this is evident both from the fact that his body is composed of contraries, and because "mortal" is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore death is not a punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, death and other bodily defects are similarly found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as well as in other animals, according to <a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse19">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>, "The death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and of beasts is one, and the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of them both equal." But in dumb animals death is not a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore neither is it so in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>: whereas death affects the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it would seem that it is not a punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all are equally descended from our first parents. Therefore if death were the punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would follow that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would suffer death in equal measure. But this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, since some die sooner, and some more painfully, than others. Therefore death is not the punishment of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of punishment is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (I, 48, 6; I, 49, 2). But death, apparently, is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse13">Wisdom 1:13</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death." Therefore death is not the punishment of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, seemingly, punishments are not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is comprised under <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and punishment under <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now death is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>, as in the case of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death. Therefore it would seem that death is not a punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, punishment would seem to be painful. But death apparently cannot be painful, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not feel it when he is dead, and he cannot feel it when he is not dying. Therefore death is not a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, if death were a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would have followed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> immediately. But this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for our first parents lived a long time after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen005.htm#verse5">Genesis 5:5</a>). Therefore, seemingly, death is not a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans 5:12</a>): "By one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> If any one, on account of his fault, be deprived of a favor bestowed on him the privation of that favor is a punishment of that fault. Now as we stated in I, 95, 1; I, 97, 1, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestowed this favor on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in his primitive state, that as long as his mind was subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lower powers of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be subject to his rational mind, and his body to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But inasmuch as through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind withdrew from subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the result was that neither were his lower powers wholly subject to his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whence there followed so great a rebellion of the carnal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> against the reason: nor was the body wholly subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; whence arose death and other bodily defects. For life and soundness of body depend on the body being subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as the perfectible is subject to its perfection. Consequently, on the other hand, death, sickness, and all defects of the body are due to the lack of the body's subjection to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>It is therefore evident that as the rebellion of the carnal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> against the spirit is a punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also are death and all defects of the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> if it proceeds from the principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> principles of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is, of itself, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>: wherefore death is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the part of his form. The <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a body such as is composed of contraries, of which corruptibility is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence, and in this respect death is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body results from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, since it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body to be the organ of touch, and consequently a mean between objects of touch: and this was impossible, were it not composed of contraries, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (De Anima ii, 11). On the other hand, this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is not attached to the adaptability of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to form because, if it were possible, since the form is incorruptible, its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> should rather be incorruptible. On the same way a saw needs to be of iron, this being suitable to its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and action, so that its hardness may make it fit for cutting. But that it be liable to rust is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of such a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and is not according to the agent's choice; for, if the craftsman were able, of the iron he would make a saw that would not rust. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the author of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is all-powerful, wherefore when He first made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He conferred on him the favor of being exempt from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> resulting from such a <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>: which favor, however, was withdrawn through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parents. Accordingly death is both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> on account of a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and penal on account of the loss of the Divine favor preserving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from death [Cf. I-II, 85, 6].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to other animals regards a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, namely the body being composed of contraries. But it does not regard the form, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of dumb animals are mortal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Our first parents were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only as particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but also as principles of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be transmitted by them to their posterity, together with the Divine favor preserving them from death. Hence through their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, being deprived of that favor in their posterity, incurred death.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A twofold defect arises from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One is by way of a punishment appointed by a judge: and such a defect should be equal in those to whom the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pertains equally. The other defect is that which results <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> from this punishment; for instance, that one who has been deprived of his sight for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he has committed, should fall down in the road. Such a defect is not proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor does a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judge take it into account, since he cannot foresee chance happenings. Accordingly, the punishment appointed for the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and proportionately corresponding thereto, was the withdrawal of the Divine favor whereby the rectitude and integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was maintained. But the defects resulting from this withdrawal are death and other penalties of the present life. Wherefore these punishments need not be equal in those to whom the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> equally appertains. Nevertheless, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows all future events, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> has so disposed that these penalties are apportioned in different ways to various people. This is not on account of any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> or demerits previous to this life, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> held [Peri Archon ii, 9: for this is contrary to the words of <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse11">Romans 9:11</a>, "When they . . . had not done any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>"; and also contrary to statements made in I, 90, 4; I, 118, 3, namely that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> before the body: but either in punishment of their parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, inasmuch as the child is something belonging to the father, wherefore parents are often punished in their children; or again it is for a remedy intended for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who suffers these penalties, to wit that he may thus be turned away from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or lest he take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and that he may be crowned for his patience.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Death may be considered in two ways. First, as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus it is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is a defect befalling <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through his fault. Secondly, as having an aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely as being a just punishment, and thus it is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 21) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the author of death, except in so far as it is a punishment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 5), "just as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> abuse not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, so do the righteous make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use not only of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. Hence it is that both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, while <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> men die well, although death is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." Wherefore inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of death, their death is to them <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Death may be considered in two ways. First, as the privation of life, and thus death cannot be felt, since it is the privation of sense and life. On this way it involves not pain of sense but pain of loss. Secondly, it may be considered as denoting the corruption which ends in the aforesaid privation. Now we may speak of corruption even as of generation in two ways: in one way as being the term of alteration, and thus in the first instant in which life departs, death is said to be present. On this way also death has no pain of sense. In another way corruption may be taken as including the previous alteration: thus a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to die, when he is in motion towards death; just as a thing is said to be engendered, while in motion towards the state of having been engendered: and thus death may be painful.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. [De Pecc. Mer. et Rem. i, 16. Cf. Gen. ad lit. ii. 32), "although our first parents lived thereafter many years, they began to die on the day when they heard the death-decree, condemning them to decline to old age."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the particular punishments of our first parents are suitably appointed in Scripture?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the particular punishments of our first parents are unsuitably appointed in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. For that which would have occurred even without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should not be described as a punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now seemingly there would have been "pain in child-bearing," even had there been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for the disposition of the female sex is such that offspring cannot be born without pain to the bearer. Likewise the "subjection of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" results from the perfection of the male, and the imperfection of the female sex. Again it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the earth "to bring forth thorns and thistles," and this would have occurred even had there been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore these are unsuitable punishments of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which pertains to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> dignity does not, seemingly, pertain to his punishment. But the "multiplying of conceptions" pertains to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> dignity. Therefore it should not be described as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> punishment.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the punishment of our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted to all, as we have stated with regard to death (1). But all "<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> conceptions" are not "multiplied," nor does "every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> eat bread in the sweat of his face." Therefore these are not suitable punishments of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the place of paradise was made for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now nothing in the order of things should be without purpose. Therefore it would seem that the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from paradise was not a suitable punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, this place of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inaccessible. Therefore it was useless to put other obstacles in the way lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should return thither, to wit the cherubim, and the "flaming sword turning every way."

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, immediately after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying, so that he could not be restored to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> by the beneficial tree of life. Therefore it was useless to forbid him to eat of the tree of life, as instanced by the words of <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis 3:22</a>: "See, lest perhaps he . . . take . . . of the tree of life . . . and live for ever."

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, to mock the unhappy seems inconsistent with mercy and clemency, which are most of all ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa144.htm#verse9">Psalm 144:9</a>, "His tender mercies are over all His works." Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is unbecomingly described as mocking our first parents, already reduced through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to unhappy straits, in the words of <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis 3:22</a>, "Behold <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is become as one of Us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 8.</strong> Further, clothes are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, like food, according to <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8</a>, "Having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content." Therefore just as food was appointed to our first parents before their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also should clothing have been ascribed to them. Therefore after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it was unsuitable to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made for them garments of skin.

<p><strong>Objection 9.</strong> Further, the punishment inflicted for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should outweigh in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the gain realized through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: else the punishment would not deter one from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>. Now through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> our first parents gained in this, that their eyes were opened, according to <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis 3:7</a>. But this outweighs in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> all the penal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are stated to have resulted from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the punishments resulting from our first parents' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are unsuitably described.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> These punishments were appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who does all things, "in number, weight, and measure [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.']" (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse21">Wisdom 11:21</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the foregoing Article, on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, our first parents were deprived of the Divine favor, whereby the integrity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was maintained in them, and by the withdrawal of this favor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> incurred penal defects. Hence they were punished in two ways. On the first place by being deprived of that which was befitting the state of integrity, namely the place of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a>: and this is indicated (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse23">Genesis 3:23</a>) where it is stated that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent him out of the paradise of pleasure." And since he was unable, of himself, to return to that state of original innocence, it was fitting that obstacles should be placed against his recovering those things that were befitting his original state, namely food (lest he should take of the tree of life) and place; for "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> placed before . . . paradise . . . <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>, and a flaming sword." Secondly, they were punished by having appointed to them things befitting a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> bereft of the aforesaid favor: and this as regards both the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. With regard to the body, to which pertains the distinction of sex, one punishment was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and another to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> punishment was appointed in respect of two things on account of which she is united to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and these are the begetting of children, and community of works pertaining to <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life. As regards the begetting of children, she was punished in two ways: first in the weariness to which she is subject while carrying the child after conception, and this is indicated in the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>), "I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions"; secondly, in the pain which she suffers in giving birth, and this is indicated by the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>), "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth." As regards <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life she was punished by being subjected to her husband's authority, and this is conveyed in the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>), "Thou shalt be under thy husband's power."

<p>Now, just as it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be subject to her husband in matters relating to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life, so it belongs to the husband to provide the necessaries of that life. On this respect he was punished in three ways. First, by the barrenness of the earth, in the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis 3:17</a>), "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> is the earth in thy work." Secondly, by the cares of his toil, without which he does not win the fruits of the earth; hence the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis 3:17</a>), "With labor and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life." Thirdly, by the obstacles encountered by the tillers of the soil, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse18">Genesis 3:18</a>), "Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee."

<p>Likewise a triple punishment is ascribed to them on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. First, by reason of the confusion they experienced at the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit; hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis 3:7</a>): "The eyes of them both were opened; and . . . they perceived themselves to be naked." Secondly, by the reproach for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, indicated by the words (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis 3:22</a>), "Behold <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is become as one of Us." Thirdly, by the reminder of their coming death, when it was said to him (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis 3:19</a>): "Dust thou art and into dust thou shalt return." To this also pertains that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made them garments of skin, as a sign of their mortality.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the state of innocence child-bearing would have been painless: for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): "Just as, in giving birth, the mother would then be relieved not by groans of pain, but by the instigations of maturity, so in bearing and conceiving the union of both sexes would be one not of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> desire but of deliberate action" [Cf. I, 98, 2].

<p>The subjection of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to her husband is to be understood as inflicted in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not as to his headship (since even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was the "head" and governor "of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>"), but as to her having now to obey her husband's will even against her own.

<p>If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the earth would have brought forth thorns and thistles to be the food of animals, but not to punish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because their growth would bring no labor or punishment for the tiller of the soil, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. iii, 18). Alcuin [Interrog. et Resp. in Gen. lxxix], however, holds that, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the earth brought forth no thorns and thistles, whatever: but the former opinion is the better.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The multiplying of her conceptions was appointed as a punishment to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not on account of the begetting of children, for this would have been the same even before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but on account of the numerous sufferings to which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is subject, through carrying her offspring after conception. Hence it is expressly stated: "I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> These punishments affect all somewhat. For any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who conceives must needs suffer sorrows and bring forth her child with pain: except the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, who "conceived without corruption, and bore without pain" [<a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, Serm. in Dom. inf. oct. Assum. B.V.M.], because her conceiving was not according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, transmitted from our first parents. And if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> neither conceives nor bears, she suffers from the defect of barrenness, which outweighs the aforesaid punishments. Likewise whoever tills the soil must needs eat his bread in the sweat of his brow: while those who do not themselves work on the land, are busied with other labors, for "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born to labor" (<a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse7">Job 5:7</a>): and thus they eat the bread for which others have labored in the sweat of their brow.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Although the place of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">earthly paradise</a> avails not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for his use, it avails him for a lesson; because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> himself deprived of that place on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and because by the things that have a bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in that paradise, he is instructed in things pertaining to the heavenly paradise, the way to which is prepared for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> Apart from the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> interpretation, this place would seem to be inaccessible, chiefly on account of the extreme heat in the middle zone by reason of the nighness of the sun. This is denoted by the "flaming sword," which is described as "turning every way," as being appropriate to the circular movement that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> this heat. And since the movements of corporal creatures are set in order through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. iii, 4), it was fitting that, besides the sword turning every way, there should be cherubim "to keep the way of the tree of life." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 40): "It is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that even in the visible paradise this was done by heavenly powers indeed, so that there was a fiery guard set there by the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> After <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had ate of the tree of life, he would not thereby have recovered <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but by means of that beneficial food he might have prolonged his life. Hence in the words "And live for ever," "for ever" signifies "for a long time." For it was not expedient for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to remain longer in the unhappiness of this life.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xi, 39), "these words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not so much a mockery of our first parents as a deterrent to others, for whose benefit these things are written, lest they be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> likewise, because <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> not only failed to become that which he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> to be, but did not keep that to which he was made."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 8.</strong> Clothing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his present state of unhappiness for two reasons. First, to supply a deficiency in respect of external harm <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by, for instance, extreme heat or cold. Secondly, to hide his ignominy and to cover the shame of those members wherein the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit is most manifest. Now these two motives do not apply to the primitive state. because then <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body could not be hurt by any outward thing, as stated in I, 97, 2, nor was there in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body anything shameful that would bring confusion on him. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis 2:23</a>): "And they were both naked, to wit <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his wife, and were not ashamed." The same cannot be said of food, which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to entertain the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> heat, and to sustain the body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 9.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 31), "We must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that our first parents were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> with their eyes closed, especially since it is stated that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was fair, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to eat. Accordingly the eyes of both were opened so that they saw and thought on things which had not occurred to their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> before, this was a mutual <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> such as they had not hitherto."
