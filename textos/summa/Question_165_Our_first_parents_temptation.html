<h1>Question 165. Our first parents' temptation</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3165.htm#article1"> Was it fitting for man to be tempted by the devil?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3165.htm#article2"> The manner and order of that temptation</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether it was fitting for man to be tempted by the devil?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that it was not fitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the same final punishment is appointed to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew 25:41</a>, "Go [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Depart from Me'] you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>' first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did not follow a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> from without. Therefore neither should <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have resulted from an outward <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who foreknows the future, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and thus He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well that it was not expedient for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be tempted. Therefore it would seem unfitting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to allow him to be tempted.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it seems to savor of punishment that anyone should have an assailant, just as on the other hand the cessation of an assault is akin to a reward. Now punishment should not precede fault. Therefore it was unfitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be tempted before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse11">Sirach 34:11</a>): "He that hath not been tempted [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'tried'], what manner of things doth he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?"

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom "orders all things sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse1">Wisdom 8:1</a>), inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> appoints to each one that which is befitting it according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv), "it belongs to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> not to destroy, but to maintain, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Now it is a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that one creature can be helped or impeded by another. Wherefore it was fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should both allow <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the state of innocence to be tempted by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to be helped by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And by a special favor of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it was granted him that no creature outside himself could harm him against his own will, whereby he was able even to resist the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is another that admits of the possibility of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of fault: but there is not above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now only one that is already become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> by leading another into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence it was fitting that by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be tempted to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> he is moved forward to perfection by means of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> could be perfected in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by something above him, namely by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but he could not thus be led into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because according to <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse13">James 1:13</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a tempter of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, through being tempted, would fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so too He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able, by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, to resist the tempter. Now the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> required that he should be left to his own will, according to <a href="../bible/sir015.htm#verse14">Sirach 15:14</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> left" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> "in the hand of his own counsel." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 4): "It seems to me that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have had no prospect of any special praise, if he were able to lead a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life simply because there was none to persuade him to lead an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life; since both by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> he had the power, and in his power he had the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not to consent to the persuader."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> An assault is penal if it be difficult to resist it: but, in the state of innocence, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able, without any difficulty, to resist <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Consequently the tempter's assault was not a punishment to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the manner and order of the first temptation was fitting?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the manner and order of the first <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> was not fitting. For just as in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so was the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> above the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: therefore in like manner it should have come upon the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> through the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; in other words the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should have been tempted by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not the other way about.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of our first parents was by suggestion. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is able to make suggestions to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without making use of an outward sensible creature. Since then our first parents were endowed with a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> mind, and adhered less to sensible than to intelligible things, it would have been more fitting for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be tempted with a merely <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, instead of an outward, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, one cannot fittingly suggest an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> except through some apparent <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But many other animals have a greater appearance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> than the serpent has. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was unfittingly tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through a serpent.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the serpent is an irrational animal. Now wisdom, speech, and punishment are not befitting an irrational animal. Therefore the serpent is unfittingly described (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis 3:1</a>) as "more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth," or as "the most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> of all beasts" according to another version [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]: and likewise is unfittingly stated to have spoken to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and to have been punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which is first in any genus should be proportionate to all that follow it in that genus. Now in every kind of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we find the same order as in the first <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. For, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xii, 12), it begins with the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sensuality, signified by the serpent; extends to the lower reason, by pleasure, signified by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and reaches to the higher reason by consent in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, signified by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore the order of the first <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> was fitting.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is composed of a twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> and sensitive. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, made use of a twofold incentive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: one on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by promising the Divine likeness through the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires to have; the other on the part of sense. This he did by having recourse to those sensible things, which are most akin to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, partly by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was akin to him in the same <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; partly by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> through the serpent, who was akin to them in the same genus; partly by suggesting to them to eat of the forbidden fruit, which was akin to them in the proximate genus.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the act of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempting</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was by way of principal agent; whereas the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was employed as an instrument of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in bringing about the downfall of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, both because the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was weaker than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and consequently more liable to be deceived, and because, on account of her union with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was able to deceive the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> especially through her. Now there is no parity between principal agent and instrument, because the principal agent must exceed in power, which is not requisite in the instrumental agent.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A suggestion whereby the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> suggests something to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spiritually, shows the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to have more power against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than outward suggestion has, since by an inward suggestion, at least, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is changed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> [Cf. I, 91, 3]; whereas by an outward suggestion, a change is wrought merely on an outward creature. Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had a minimum of power against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore he was unable to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> him by inward suggestion, but only by outward suggestion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xi, 3), "we are not to suppose that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> chose the serpent as his means of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; but as he was possessed of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of deceit, he could only do so by the animal he was allowed to use for that purpose."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xi, 29), "the serpent is described as most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> or subtle, on account of the cunning of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who wrought his wiles in it: thus, we speak of a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> or cunning tongue, because it is the instrument of a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> or cunning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in advising something prudently or cunningly. Nor indeed (Gen. ad lit. xi, 28) did the serpent understand the sounds which were conveyed through it to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; nor again are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was changed into a rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since not even men, who are rational by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they say when a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> speaks in them. Accordingly (Gen. ad lit. xi, 29) the serpent spoke to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even as the ass on which Balaam sat spoke to him, except that the former was the work of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whereas the latter was the work of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Hence (Gen. ad lit. xi, 36) the serpent was not asked why it had done this, because it had not done this in its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in it, who was already condemned to everlasting fire on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and the words addressed to the serpent were directed to him who wrought through the serpent."

<p>Moreover, as again <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Super Gen. contra Manich. ii, 17,18), "his, that is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>, punishment mentioned here is that for which we must be on our guard against him, not that which is reserved till the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a>. For when it was said to him: 'Thou art <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> among all cattle and beasts of the earth,' the cattle are set above him, not in power, but in the preservation of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since the cattle lost no heavenly bliss, seeing that they never had it, but they continue to live in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which they received." It is also said to him: "'Upon thy breast and belly shalt thou creep,'" according to another version [the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>] "Here the breast signifies <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because it is there that the impulse of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dominates, while the belly denotes carnal desire, because this part of the body is softest to the touch: and on these he creeps to those whom he wishes to deceive." The words, "'Earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life' may be understood in two ways. Either 'Those shall belong to thee, whom thou shalt deceive by earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,' namely sinners who are signified under the name of earth, or a third kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, namely curiosity, is signified by these words: for to eat earth is to look into things deep and dark." The putting of enmities between him and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> "means that we cannot be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, except through that part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which bears or reflects the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The seed of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the seed of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the fruit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is resisted. Wherefore the serpent lies in wait for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> heel, that if at any time she fall away towards what is unlawful, pleasure may seize hold of her: and she watches his head that she may shut him out at the very outset of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>."
