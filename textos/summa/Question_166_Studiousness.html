<h1>Question 166. Studiousness</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3166.htm#article1"> What is the matter of studiousness?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3166.htm#article2"> Is it a part of temperance?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the proper matter of studiousness is knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the proper <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of studiousness. For a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be studious because he applies study to certain things. Now a man ought to apply study to every <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in order to do aright what has to be done. Therefore seemingly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the special <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of studiousness.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, studiousness is opposed to curiosity. Now curiosity, which is derived from "cura" [care], may also refer to elegance of apparel and other such things, which regard the body; wherefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a>): "Make not provision [curam] for the flesh in its <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscences</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further it is written (<a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 6:13</a>): "From the least of them even to the greatest, all study [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'are given to'] <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not properly about <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but rather about the possession of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as stated above (Question 118, Article 2). Therefore studiousness, which is derived from "study," is not properly about <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse11">Proverbs 27:11</a>): "Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyful</a>, that thou mayest give an answer to him that reproacheth." Now study, which is commended as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is the same as that to which the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> urges. Therefore studiousness is properly about "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Properly speaking, study denotes keen application of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to something. Now the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not applied to a thing except by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that thing. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> application to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> precedes its application to those things to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence study regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the first place, and as a result it regards any other things the working of which requires to be directed by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> lay claim to that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> about which they are first and foremost; thus <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is concerned about dangers of death, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> about pleasures of touch. Therefore studiousness is properly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Nothing can be done aright as regards other matters, except in so far as is previously directed by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> reason. Hence studiousness, to whatever <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> it be applied, has a prior regard for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> mind is drawn, on account of his affections, towards the things for which he has an affection, according to <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew 6:21</a>, "Where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also." And since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has special affection for those things which foster the flesh, it follows that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> thoughts are concerned about things that foster his flesh, so that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how he may best sustain his body. Accordingly curiosity is accounted to be about things pertaining to the body by reason of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Covetousness craves the acquisition of gain, and for this it is very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to be skilled in earthly things. Accordingly studiousness is ascribed to things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether studiousness is a part of temperance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that studiousness is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For a man is said to be studious by reason of his studiousness. Now all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without exception are called studious according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a>, who frequently employs the term "studious" (<em>spoudaios</em>) in this sense (Ethic. ix, 4,8,9). [In the same sense <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says in Ethic. iii, 2, that "every <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what he ought to do."] Therefore studiousness is a general <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, studiousness, as stated (1), pertains to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has no connection with the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are in the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and pertains rather to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are in the cognitive part: wherefore solicitude is an act of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> as stated above (Question 47, Article 09). Therefore studiousness is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that is ascribed as part of a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> resembles the latter as to mode. Now studiousness does not resemble <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> as to mode, because <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> takes its name from being a kind of restraint, wherefore it is more opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that is in excess: whereas studiousness is denominated from being the application of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to something, so that it would seem to be opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that is in default, namely, neglect of study, rather than to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which is in excess, namely curiosity. wherefore, on account of its resemblance to the latter, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. x) that "a studious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is one who is curious to study." Therefore studiousness is not a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. 21): "We are forbidden to be curious: and this is a great <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> that <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> bestows." Now curiosity is prevented by moderate studiousness. Therefore studiousness is a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (141, 3,4,5), it belongs to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> to moderate the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, lest it tend excessively to that which is desired <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now just as in respect of his corporeal <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires the pleasures of food and sex, so, in respect of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something; thus the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> observes at the beginning of his Metaphysics i, 1: "All men have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> desire for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p>The moderation of this desire pertains to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of studiousness; wherefore it follows that studiousness is a <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potential</a> part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as a subordinate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> annexed to a principal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Moreover, it is comprised under modesty for the reason given above (Question 160, Article 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">Prudence</a> is the complement of all the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Consequently, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> pertains to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the term "studiousness," which properly regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is applied to all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The act of a cognitive power is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, which moves all the powers, as stated above (I-II, 09, 1). Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regards a twofold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. One is connected with the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself; and this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> estimate about each thing. The other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pertains to the act of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, and consists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> being directed aright in applying the cognitive power in this or that way to this or that thing. And this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of seriousness. Wherefore it is reckoned among the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ii, 93) in order to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> we must avoid those things to which we are most <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined. Hence it is that, since <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inclines us. chiefly to fear dangers of death, and to seek pleasures of the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is chiefly commended for a certain steadfast perseverance against such dangers, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> for a certain restraint from pleasures of the flesh. But as regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has contrary inclinations. For on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he is inclined to desire <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things; and so it behooves him to exercise a praiseworthy restraint on this desire, lest he seek <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> immoderately: whereas on the part of his bodily <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is inclined to avoid the trouble of seeking <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Accordingly, as regards the first inclination studiousness is a kind of restraint, and it is in this sense that it is reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. But as to the second inclination, this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> derives its praise from a certain keenness of interest in seeking <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things; and from this it takes its name. The former is more <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than the latter: since the desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> directly regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to which studiousness is directed, whereas the trouble of learning is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, wherefore it is regarded by this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> indirectly, as by that which removes an obstacle.
