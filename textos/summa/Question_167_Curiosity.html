<h1>Question 167. Curiosity</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3167.htm#article1"> Can the vice of curiosity regard intellective knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3167.htm#article2"> Is it about sensitive knowledge?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether curiosity can be about intellective knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that curiosity cannot be about <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Because, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6), there can be no mean and extremes in things which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perfection would seem to consist in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> being reduced from <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potentiality</a> to act, and this is done by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be in accordance with reason," whose perfection consists in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity cannot be about <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which he receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now all abundance of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse1">Sirach 1:1</a>, "All wisdom is from the Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse17">Wisdom 7:17</a>, "He hath given me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things that are, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the disposition of the whole world, and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the elements," etc. Again, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is likened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since "all things are naked and open to His eyes" (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse13">Hebrews 4:13</a>), and "the Lord is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (<a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse3">1 Samuel 2:3</a>). Therefore however abundant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be, it is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now the desire of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity cannot be about the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity can be about any kind of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it would be chiefly about the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical sciences</a>. But, seemingly, there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in being intent on them: for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says (Super Daniel 1:8): "Those who refused to partake of the king's meat and wine, lest they should be defiled, if they had considered the wisdom and teaching of the Babylonians to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, would never have consented to learn that which was unlawful": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 40) that "if the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> made any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> statements, we must claim them for our own use, as from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> possessors." Therefore curiosity about <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Comment. in Ep. ad Ephes. iv, 17 says: "Is it not evident that a man who day and night wrestles with the dialectic art, the student of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> science whose gaze pierces the heavens, walks in vanity of understanding and darkness of mind?" Now vanity of understanding and darkness of mind are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore curiosity about <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (166, 2, ad 2) studiousness is directly, not about <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself, but about the desire and study in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now we must judge differently of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and of the desire and study in the pursuit of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, strictly speaking, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but it may be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, by reason of some result, either because one takes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> puffeth up," or because one uses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the desire or study in pursuing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be right or wrong. First, when one tends by his study to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as having <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> annexed to it, for instance those who study to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that they may take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Morib. Eccl. 21): "Some there are who forsaking <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, and of the majesty of that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which ever remains the same, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> they are doing something great, if with surpassing curiosity and keenness they explore the whole mass of this body which we call the world. So great a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is thus begotten, that one would think they dwelt in the very heavens about which they argue." On like manner, those who study to learn something in order to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are engaged in a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> study, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 9:5</a>, "They have taught their tongue to speak lies, they have labored to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>."

<p>Secondly, there may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> or study directed to the learning of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being itself inordinate; and this in four ways. First, when a man is withdrawn by a less profitable study from a study that is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> incumbent on him; hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says [Epist. xxi ad Damas]: "We see <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> forsaking the gospels and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, reading stage-plays, and singing the love songs of pastoral idylls." Secondly, when a man studies to learn of one, by whom it is unlawful to be taught, as in the case of those who seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> curiosity, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 4): "Maybe, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were debarred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> curiosity in seeking <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>."

<p>Thirdly, when a man desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about creatures, without referring his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to its due end, namely, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 29) that "in studying creatures, we must not be moved by empty and perishable curiosity; but we should ever mount towards <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and abiding things."

<p>Fourthly, when a man studies to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> above the capacity of his own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>, since by so doing men easily fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse22">Sirach 3:22</a>): "Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability . . . and in many of His works be not curious," and further on (<a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse26">Sirach 3:26</a>), "For . . . the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> in vanity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sovereign <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> consists, not in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but in the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sovereign <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. x, 7,8). Hence there may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, in so far as the desire of such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not directed in due manner to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sovereign <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherein supreme <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although this argument shows that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in itself, this does not prevent a man from misusing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose, or from desiring the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> inordinately, since even the desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> should be regulated in due manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is in itself lawful and commendable, on account of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> acquired through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealing it to them, as stated in <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19</a>. Since, however, certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> misuse the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in order to assail the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians 2:8</a>): "Beware lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cheat you by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, according to the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> . . . and not according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>": and <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Ep. vii ad Polycarp.) of certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that "they make an unholy use of divine things against that which is divine, and by divine wisdom strive to destroy the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the vice of curiosity is about sensitive knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity is not about sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For just as some things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the sense of sight, so too are some things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the senses of touch and taste. Now the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> concerned about objects of touch and taste is not curiosity but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> or <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Therefore seemingly neither is the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity about things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the sight.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, curiosity would seem to refer to watching games; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. vi, 8) that when "a fall occurred in the fight, a mighty cry of the whole people struck him strongly, and overcome by curiosity Alypius opened his eyes." But it does not seem to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to watch games, because it gives pleasure on account of the representation, wherein <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> takes a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> delight, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Poet. vi). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity is not about the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible objects.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it would seem to pertain to curiosity to inquire into our neighbor's actions, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> observes [Comment. in 1 John 2:16]. Now, seemingly, it is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to inquire into the actions of others, because according to <a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse12">Sirach 17:12</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "gave to every one of them commandment concerning his neighbor." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity does not regard the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such like particular sensible objects.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 38) that "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes makes men curious." Now according to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Comment. in 1 John 2:16) "<a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes refers not only to the learning of magic arts, but also to sight-seeing, and to the discovery and dispraise of our neighbor's faults," and all these are particular objects of sense. Therefore since <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eves is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, which are members of the same division (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1 John 2:16</a>), it seems that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of curiosity is about the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things is directed to two things. For in the first place, both in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and in other animals, it is directed to the upkeep of the body, because by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this kind, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and other animals avoid what is harmful to them, and seek those things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the body's sustenance. On the second place, it is directed in a manner special to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether speculative or practical. Accordingly to employ study for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> sensible things may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in two ways. First, when the sensitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not directed to something useful, but turns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> away from some useful consideration. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. x, 35), "I go no more to see a dog coursing a hare in the circus; but in the open country, if I happen to be passing, that coursing haply will distract me from some weighty thought, and draw me after it . . . and unless Thou, having made me see my weakness, didst speedily admonish me, I become foolishly dull." Secondly, when the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things is directed to something harmful, as looking on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: even so the busy inquiry into other people's actions is directed to detraction. on the other hand, if one be ordinately intent on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of sustaining <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or for the sake of the study of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this studiousness about the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sensible things is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Lust and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> are about pleasures arising from the use of objects of touch, whereas curiosity is about pleasures arising from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired through all the senses. According to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. x, 35) "it is called <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes" because "the sight is the sense chiefly used for obtaining <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that all sensible things are said to be seen," and as he says further on: "By this it may more evidently be discerned wherein pleasure and wherein curiosity is the object of the senses; for pleasure seeketh objects beautiful, melodious, fragrant, savory, soft; but curiosity, for trial's sake, seeketh even the contraries of these, not for the sake of suffering annoyance, but out of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of experiment and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Sight-seeing becomes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, when it renders a man prone to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and cruelty on account of things he sees represented. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. vi in Matth.] that such sights make men <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a> and shameless.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> One may watch other people's actions or inquire into them, with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> intent, either for one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--that is in order to be encouraged to better <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of our neighbor--or for our neighbor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>--that is in order to correct him, if he do anything wrong, according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of one's position. This is praiseworthy, according to <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse24">Hebrews 10:24</a>, "Consider one another to provoke unto <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works." But to observe our neighbor's faults with the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of looking down upon them, or of detracting them, or even with no further purpose than that of disturbing them, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse15">Proverbs 24:15</a>), "Lie not in wait, nor seek after <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest."
