<h1>Question 168. Modesty as consisting in the outward movements of the body</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3168.htm#article1"> Can there be virtue and vice in the outward movements of the body that are done seriously?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3168.htm#article2"> Can there be a virtue about playful actions?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3168.htm#article3"> The sin consisting in excess of play</a> <li><a href="../summa/3168.htm#article4"> The sin consisting in lack of play</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any virtue regards the outward movements of the body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> regards the outward movements of the body. For every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa044.htm#verse14">Psalm 44:14</a>, "All the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the king's daughter is within," and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> adds, "namely, in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." Now the movements of the body are not within, but without. Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Virtues are not in us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 1). But outward bodily movements are in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since it is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that some are quick, and some slow of movement, and the same applies to other differences of outward movements. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about movements of this kind.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either about actions directed to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or about <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Now outward bodily movements are not directed to another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, nor are they <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is connected with them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, study should be applied to all works of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as stated above (166, 1, Objection 1; 2, ad 1). Now it is censurable to apply study to the ordering of one's outward movements: for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18): "A becoming gait is one that reflects the carriage of authority, has the tread of gravity, and the foot-print of tranquillity: yet so that there be neither study nor affectation, but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and artless movement." Therefore seemingly there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about the style of outward movements.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The beauty of honesty [Cf. 145, 1] pertains to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now the style of outward movements pertains to the beauty of honesty. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18): "The sound of the voice and the gesture of the body are distasteful to me, whether they be unduly soft and nerveless, or coarse and boorish. Let <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> be our model; her reflection is gracefulness of conduct and beauty of honesty." Therefore there is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about the style of outward movement.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists in the things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> being directed by his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now it is manifest that the outward movements of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are dirigible by reason, since the outward members are set in motion at the command of reason. Hence it is evident that there is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> concerned with the direction of these movements.

<p>Now the direction of these movements may be considered from a twofold standpoint. First, in respect of fittingness to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; secondly, in respect of fittingness to externals, whether <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, business, or place. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18): "Beauty of conduct consists in becoming behavior towards others, according to their sex and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," and this regards the first. As to the second, he adds: "This is the best way to order our behavior, this is the polish becoming to every action."

<p>Hence Andronicus [De Affectibus] ascribes two things to these outward movements: namely "taste" [ornatus] which regards what is becoming to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, wherefore he says that it is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is becoming in movement and behavior; and "methodicalness" [bona ordinatio] which regards what is becoming to the business in hand, and to one's surroundings, wherefore he calls it "the practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of separation," i.e. of the distinction of "acts."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Outward movements are signs of the inward disposition, according to <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse27">Sirach 19:27</a>, "The attire of the body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, show what he is"; and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18) that "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of mind is seen in the gesture of the body," and that "the body's movement is an index of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although it is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition that a man is inclined to this or that style of outward movement, nevertheless what is lacking to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be supplied by the efforts of reason. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18): "Let <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> guide the movement: and if <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fail in any respect, surely effort will supply the defect."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated (ad 1) outward movements are indications of the inward disposition, and this regards chiefly the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18) that "from these things," i.e. the outward movements, "the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that lies hidden in our hearts is esteemed to be either frivolous, or boastful, or impure, or on the other hand sedate, steady, pure, and free from blemish." It is moreover from our outward movements that other men form their judgment about us, according to <a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse26">Sirach 19:26</a>, "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his look, and a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when thou meetest him, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his countenance." Hence moderation of outward movements is directed somewhat to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his Rule (Ep. ccxi), "In all your movements, let nothing be done to offend the eye of another, but only that which is becoming to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of your state." Wherefore the moderation of outward movements may be reduced to two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> mentions in Ethic. iv, 6,7. For, in so far as by outward movements we are directed to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the moderation of our outward movements belongs to "friendliness or affability" [Cf. 114, 1]. This regards pleasure or pain which may arise from words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in reference to others with whom a man comes in contact. And, in so far as outward movements are signs of our inward disposition, their moderation belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of truthfulness [Cf. 9], whereby a man, by word and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, shows himself to be such as he is inwardly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is censurable to study the style of one's outward movements, by having recourse to pretense in them, so that they do not agree with one's inward disposition. Nevertheless it behooves one to study them, so that if they be in any way inordinate, this may be corrected. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 18): "Let them be without artifice, but not without correction."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there can be a virtue about games?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about games. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 23): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said: 'Woe to you who laugh, for you shall weep.' Wherefore I consider that all, and not only excessive, games should be avoided." Now that which can be done virtuously is not to be avoided altogether. Therefore there cannot be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about games.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "Virtue is that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forms in us, without us," as stated above (I-II, 55, 4). Now <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. vi in Matth.]: "It is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that is the author of fun. Listen to what happened to those who played: 'The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.'" Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about games.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. x, 6) that "playful actions are not directed to something else." But it is a requisite of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that the agent in choosing should "direct his action to something else," as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. ii, 4). Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about games.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Music. ii, 15): "I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thee, spare thyself at times: for it becomes a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sometimes to relax the high pressure of his attention to work." Now this relaxation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> from work consists in playful words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Therefore it becomes a wise and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have recourse to such things at times. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> [Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 8 assigns to games the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <em>eutrapelia</em>, which we may call "pleasantness."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs bodily rest for the body's refreshment, because he cannot always be at work, since his power is finite and equal to a certain fixed amount of labor, so too is it with his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose power is also finite and equal to a fixed amount of work. Consequently when he goes beyond his measure in a certain work, he is oppressed and becomes weary, and all the more since when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> works, the body is at work likewise, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> employs forces that operate through bodily organs. Now sensible goods are connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arises above sensibles, through being intent on the operations of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, there results in consequence a certain weariness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether the operations with which it is occupied be those of the practical or of the speculative reason. Yet this weariness is greater if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be occupied with the work of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, since thereby it is raised higher above sensible things; although perhaps certain outward works of the practical reason entail a greater bodily labor. On either case, however, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is more soul-wearied than another, according as he is more intensely occupied with works of reason. Now just as weariness of the body is dispelled by resting the body, so weariness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must needs be remedied by resting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> rest is pleasure, as stated above (I-II, 25, 2; I-II, 31, 1, ad 2). Consequently, the remedy for weariness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must needs consist in the application of some pleasure, by slackening the tension of the reason's study. Thus in the Conferences of the Fathers xxiv, 21, it is related of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Blessed John the Evangelist</a>, that when some people were scandalized on finding him playing together with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he is said to have told one of them who carried a bow to shoot an arrow. And when the latter had done this several times, he asked him whether he could do it indefinitely, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> answered that if he continued doing it, the bow would break. Whence the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Blessed John</a> drew the inference that in like manner <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind would break if its tension were never relaxed.

<p>Now such like words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> wherein nothing further is sought than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> delight, are called playful or humorous. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> at times to make use of them, in order to give rest, as it were, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is in agreement with the statement of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 8) that "in the intercourse of this life there is a kind of rest that is associated with games": and consequently it is sometimes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make use of such things.

<p>Nevertheless it would seem that in this matter there are three points which require especial caution. The first and chief is that the pleasure in question should not be sought in indecent or injurious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or words. Wherefore Tully says (De Offic. i, 29) that "one kind of joke is discourteous, insolent, scandalous, obscene." Another thing to be observed is that one lose not the balance of one's mind altogether. Hence <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 20): "We should beware lest, when we seek relaxation of mind, we destroy all that harmony which is the concord of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works": and Tully says (De Offic. i, 29), that, "just as we do not allow children to enjoy absolute freedom in their games, but only that which is consistent with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> behavior, so our very fun should reflect something of an upright mind." Thirdly, we must be careful, as in all other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions, to conform ourselves to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, time, and place, and take due account of other circumstances, so that our fun "befit the hour and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as Tully says (De Offic. i, 29).

<p>Now these things are directed according to the rule of reason: and a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that operates according to reason is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore there can be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> about games. The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> gives it the name of wittiness (<em>eutrapelia</em>), and a man is said to be pleasant through having a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> turn* of mind, whereby he gives his words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> a cheerful turn: and inasmuch as this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> restrains a man from immoderate fun, it is comprised under modesty. [<em>Eutrapelia</em> is derived from <em>trepein</em> = 'to turn'].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, fun should fit with business and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; wherefore Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. i, 17) that "when the audience is weary, it will be useful for the speaker to try something novel or amusing, provided that joking be not incompatible with the gravity of the subject." Now the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a> is concerned with things of the greatest moment, according to <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse6">Proverbs 8:6</a>, "Hear, for I will speak of great things." Wherefore <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> does not altogether exclude fun from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech, but from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">sacred doctrine</a>; hence he begins by saying: "Although jokes are at times fitting and pleasant, nevertheless they are incompatible with the ecclesiastical rule; since how can we have recourse to things which are not to be found in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> refers to the inordinate use of fun, especially by those who make the pleasure of games their end; of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/wis015.htm#verse12">Wisdom 15:12</a>): "They have accounted our life a pastime." Against these Tully says (De Offic. i, 29): "We are so begotten by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that we appear to be made not for play and fun, but rather for hardships, and for occupations of greater gravity and moment."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Playful actions themselves considered in their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are not directed to an end: but the pleasure derived from such actions is directed to the recreation and rest of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and accordingly if this be done with moderation, it is lawful to make use of fun. Hence Tully says (De Offic. i, 29): "It is indeed lawful to make use of play and fun, but in the same way as we have recourse to sleep and other kinds of rest, then only when we have done our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by grave and serious matters."

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there can be sin in the excess of play?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the excess of play. For that which is an excuse for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not held to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now play is sometimes an excuse for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for many things would be grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if they were done seriously, whereas if they be done in fun, are either no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or but slightly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Therefore it seems that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in excessive play.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are reducible to the seven capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> states (Moral. xxxi, 17). But excess of play does not seem reducible to any of the capital <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore it would seem not to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, comedians especially would seem to exceed in play, since they direct their whole life to playing. Therefore if excess of play were a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all actors would be in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; moreover all those who employ them, as well as those who make them any payment, would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as accomplices of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this would seem <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; for it is related in the Lives of the Fathers (ii. 16; viii. 63) that is was revealed to the Blessed Paphnutius that a certain jester would be with him in the life to come.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse13">Proverbs 14:13</a>, "Laughter shall be mingled with sorrow and mourning taketh hold of the end of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>," remarks: "A mourning that will last for ever." Now there is inordinate laughter and inordinate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in excessive play. Therefore there is mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therein, since mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone is deserving of everlasting mourning.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In all things dirigible according to reason, the excessive is that which goes beyond, and the deficient is that which falls short of the rule of reason. Now it has been stated (2) that playful or jesting words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are dirigible according to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore excessive play is that which goes beyond the rule of reason: and this happens in two ways. First, on account of the very <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the acts employed for the purpose of fun, and this kind of jesting, according to Tully (De Offic. i, 29), is stated to be "discourteous, insolent, scandalous, and obscene," when to wit a man, for the purpose of jesting, employs indecent words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or such as are injurious to his neighbor, these being of themselves mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And thus it is evident that excessive play is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Secondly, there may be excess in play, through lack of due circumstances: for instance when people make use of fun at undue times or places, or out of keeping with the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in hand, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. This may be sometimes a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of the strong attachment to play, when a man prefers the pleasure he derives therefrom to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to be willing to disobey a commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rather than forego, such like amusements. Sometimes, however, it is a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for instance where a man is not so attached to amusement as to be willing for its sake to do anything in disobedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Certain things are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> alone, because they are done in order to injure someone. Such an <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is excluded by their being done in fun, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of which is to please, not to injure: in these cases fun excuses from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or diminishes it. Other things, however, are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to their <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, fornication, and the like: and fun is no excuse for these; in fact they make fun scandalous and obscene.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Excessive play pertains to senseless mirth, which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Moral. xxxi, 17) calls a daughter of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse6">Exodus 32:6</a>): "The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated (2), play is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the intercourse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Now whatever is useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse may have a lawful employment ascribed to it. Wherefore the occupation of play-actors, the object of which is to cheer the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is not unlawful in itself; nor are they in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> provided that their playing be moderated, namely that they use no unlawful words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in order to amuse, and that they do not introduce play into undue matters and seasons. And although in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, they have no other occupation in reference to other men, nevertheless in reference to themselves, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they perform other actions both serious and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the moderation of their own <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and operations, while sometimes they give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the poor. Wherefore those who maintain them in moderation do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but act <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, by rewarding them for their services. on the other hand, if a man spends too much on such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or maintains those comedians who practice unlawful mirth, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as encouraging them in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. c. in Joan.) that "to give one's property to comedians is a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>"; unless by chance some play-actor were in extreme need, in which case one would have to assist him, for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. [Quoted in Canon Pasce, dist. 86): "Feed him that dies of hunger; for whenever thou canst save a man by feeding him, if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain him."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether there is a sin in lack of mirth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in lack of mirth. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is prescribed to a penitent. But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaking of a penitent says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. 15) [Spurious]: "Let him refrain from games and the sights of the world, if he wishes to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a full pardon." Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in lack of mirth.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is included in the praise given to holy men. But some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are praised for having refrained from mirth; for it is written (<a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse17">Jeremiah 15:17</a>): "I sat not in the assembly of jesters," and (<a href="../bible/tob003.htm#verse17">Tobit 3:17</a>): "Never have I joined myself with them that play; neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness." Therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the lack of mirth.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, Andronicus counts austerity to be one of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and he describes it as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> whereby a man neither gives nor receives the pleasures of conversation. Now this pertains to the lack of mirth. Therefore the lack of mirth is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 8) reckons the lack of mirth to be a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs whatever is against reason is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now it is against reason for a man to be burdensome to others, by offering no pleasure to others, and by hindering their enjoyment. Wherefore Seneca [<a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">Martin of Braga</a>, Formula Vitae Honestae: cap. De Continentia] says (De Quat. Virt., cap. De Continentia): "Let your conduct be guided by wisdom so that no one will think you rude, or despise you as a cad." Now a man who is without mirth, not only is lacking in playful speech, but is also burdensome to others, since he is deaf to the moderate mirth of others. Consequently they are vicious, and are said to be boorish or rude, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Ethic. iv, 8).

<p>Since, however, mirth is useful for the sake of the rest and pleasures it affords; and since, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, pleasure and rest are not in quest for their own sake, but for the sake of operation, as stated in Ethic. x, 6, it follows that "lack of mirth is less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> than excess thereof." Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 10): "We should make few friends for the sake of pleasure, since but little sweetness suffices to season life, just as little salt suffices for our meat."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Mirth is forbidden the penitent because he is called upon to mourn for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nor does this imply a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in default, because this very diminishment of mirth in them is in accordance with reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> speaks there in accordance with the times, the state of which required that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should mourn; wherefore he adds: "I sat alone, because Thou hast filled me with threats." The words of <a href="../bible/tob003.htm">Tobit 3</a> refer to excessive mirth; and this is evident from his adding: "Neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Austerity, as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, does not exclude all pleasures, but only such as are excessive and inordinate; wherefore it would seem to pertain to affability, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. iv, 6) calls "friendliness," or <em>eutrapelia</em>, otherwise wittiness. Nevertheless he names and defines it thus in respect of its agreement with <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, to which it belongs to restrain pleasure.
