<h1>Question 169. Modesty in the outward apparel</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3169.htm#article1"> Can there be virtue and vice in connection with outward apparel?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3169.htm#article2"> Do women sin mortally by excessive adornment?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there can be virtue and vice in connection with outward apparel?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in connection with outward apparel. For outward adornment does not belong to us by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore it varies according to different times and places. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12) that "among the ancient Romans it was scandalous for one to wear a cloak with sleeves and reaching to the ankles, whereas now it is scandalous for anyone hailing from a reputable place to be without them." Now according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 1) there is in us a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> aptitude for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> about such things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if there were <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in connection with outward attire, excess in this matter would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. Now excess in outward attire is not apparently <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, since even the ministers of the altar use most precious <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> in the sacred ministry. Likewise it would seem not to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to be lacking in this, for it is said in praise of certain people (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse37">Hebrews 11:37</a>): "They wandered about in sheepskins and in goatskins." Therefore it seems that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in this matter.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is either theological, or moral, or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Now an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not conversant with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this kind, since it is a perfection regarding the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Nor is there a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> connected therewith, since that has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object; nor are any of the moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7), connected with it. Therefore it seems that there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in connection with this kind of attire.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Honesty [Cf. 145] pertains to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now a certain honesty is observed in the outward apparel; for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Offic. i, 19): "The body should be bedecked <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> and without affectation, with simplicity, with negligence rather than nicety, not with costly and dazzling apparel, but with ordinary clothes, so that nothing be lacking to honesty and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, yet nothing be added to increase its beauty." Therefore there can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in the outward attire.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> It is not in the outward things themselves which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> uses, that there is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who uses them immoderately. This lack of moderation occurs in two ways. First, in comparison with the customs of those among whom one lives; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. iii, 8): "Those offenses which are contrary to the customs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are to be avoided according to the customs generally prevailing, so that a thing agreed upon and confirmed by custom or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of any city or nation may not be violated at the lawless pleasure of any, whether citizen or foreigner. For any part, which harmonizeth not with its whole, is offensive." Secondly, the lack of moderation in the use of these things may arise from the inordinate attachment of the user, the result being that a man sometimes takes too much pleasure in using them, either in accordance with the custom of those among whom he dwells or contrary to such custom. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12): "We must avoid excessive pleasure in the use of things, for it leads not only wickedly to abuse the customs of those among whom we dwell, but frequently to exceed their bounds, so that, whereas it lay hidden, while under the restraint of established <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, it displays its deformity in a most lawless outbreak."

<p>In point of excess, this inordinate attachment occurs in three ways. First when a man seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from excessive attention to dress; in so far as dress and such like things are a kind of ornament. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. xl in Ev.): "There are some who think that attention to finery and costly dress is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Surely, if this were no fault, the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not say so expressly that the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was tortured in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> had been clothed in purple and fine linen. No one, forsooth, seeks costly apparel" (such, namely, as exceeds his estate) "save for vainglory." Secondly, when a man seeks sensuous pleasure from excessive attention to dress, in so far as dress is directed to the body's comfort. Thirdly, when a man is too solicitous [Cf. 55, 6] in his attention to outward apparel.

<p>Accordingly Andronicus [De Affectibus] reckons three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in connection with outward attire; namely "<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>," which excludes the seeking of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, wherefore he says that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is "the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of avoiding excessive expenditure and parade"; "contentment" [Cf. 143, Objection 4], which excludes the seeking of sensuous pleasure, wherefore he says that "contentedness is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that makes a man satisfied with what is suitable, and enables him to determine what is becoming in his manner of life" (according to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>, <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8</a>): "Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these let us be content;"--and "simplicity," which excludes excessive solicitude about such things, wherefore he says that "simplicity is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> that makes a man contented with what he has."

<p>In the point of deficiency there may be inordinate attachment in two ways. First, through a man's neglect to give the requisite study or trouble to the use of outward apparel. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "it is a mark of effeminacy to let one's cloak trail on the ground to avoid the trouble of lifting it up." Secondly, by seeking <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the very lack of attention to outward attire. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12) that "not only the glare and pomp of outward things, but even dirt and the weeds of mourning may be a subject of ostentation, all the more dangerous as being a decoy under the guise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service"; and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "both excess and inordinate defect are a subject of ostentation."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although outward attire does not come from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it belongs to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to moderate it; so that we are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to be the recipients of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that moderates outward raiment.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those who are placed in a position of dignity, or again the ministers of the altar, are attired in more costly apparel than others, not for the sake of their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but to indicate the excellence of their office or of the Divine worship: wherefore this is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in them. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12): "Whoever uses outward things in such a way as to exceed the bounds observed by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> people among whom he dwells, either signifies something by so doing, or is guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, inasmuch as he uses these things for sensual pleasure or ostentation."

<p>Likewise there may be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on the part of deficiency: although it is not always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to wear coarser clothes than other people. For, if this be done through ostentation or <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in order to set oneself above others, it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; whereas, if this be done to tame the flesh, or to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the spirit, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12): "Whoever uses transitory things with greater restraint than is customary with those among whom he dwells, is either temperate or <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>." Especially, however, is the use of coarse raiment befitting to those who by word and example urge others to repentance, as did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking in the passage quoted. Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew 3:4</a>, says: "He who preaches penance, wears the garb of penance."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This outward apparel is an indication of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> estate; wherefore excess, deficiency, and mean therein, are referable to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of truthfulness, which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 7) assigns to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, which are indications of something connected with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> estate.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the adornment of women is devoid of mortal sin?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is not devoid of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For whatever is contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is contrary to a precept of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse3">1 Peter 3:3</a>): "Whose," namely <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a>, "adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel." Wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says: "Those who are clothed in silk and purple cannot sincerely put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: those who are bedecked with gold and pearls and trinkets have forfeited the adornments of mind and body." Now this is not done without a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> cannot be devoid of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> says (De Habit. Virg.): "I hold that not only <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but also wives and all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> without exception, should be admonished that nowise should they deface <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work and fabric, the clay that He has fashioned, with the aid of yellow pigments, black powders or rouge, or by applying any dye that alters the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> features." And afterwards he adds: "They lay hands on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they strive to reform what He has formed. This is an assault on the Divine handiwork, a distortion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thou shalt not be able to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having no longer the eyes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, but those the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has unmade; with him shalt thou burn on whose account thou art bedecked." But this is not due except to mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is not devoid of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, just as it is unbecoming for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to wear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> clothes, so is it unbecoming for her to adorn herself inordinately. Now the former is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>): "A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be clothed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> apparel, neither shall a man use <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> apparel." Therefore it seems that also the excessive adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> If this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> it would seem that the makers of these means of adornment <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As regards the adornment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, we must bear in mind the general statements made above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) concerning outward apparel, and also something special, namely that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> apparel may incite men to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, according to <a href="../bible/pro007.htm#verse10">Proverbs 7:10</a>, "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> meeteth him in harlot's attire, prepared to deceive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>."

<p>Nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may use means to please her husband, lest through despising her he fall into <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> "that is <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband." Wherefore if a <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> adorn herself in order to please her husband she can do this without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>But those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have no husband nor wish to have one, or who are in a state of life inconsistent with marriage, cannot without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> desire to give <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> pleasure to those men who see them, because this is to incite them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if indeed they adorn themselves with this <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of provoking others to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> mortally; whereas if they do so from frivolity, or from vanity for the sake of ostentation, it is not always mortal, but sometimes venial. And the same applies to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this respect. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ccxlv ad Possid.): "I do not wish you to be hasty in forbidding the wearing of gold or costly attire except in the case of those who being neither <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> nor wishful to marry, should think how they may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: whereas the others think on the things of the world, either husbands how they may please their wives, or wives how they may please their husbands, except that it is unbecoming for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> though <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> to uncover their hair, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> commands them to cover the head." Yet in this case some might be excused from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when they do this not through vanity but on account of some contrary custom: although such a custom is not to be commended.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on this passage, "The wives of those who were in distress despised their husbands, and decked themselves that they might please other men": and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> forbids this. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> is speaking in the same sense; yet he does not forbid <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to adorn themselves in order to please their husbands, lest the latter be afforded an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 2:9</a>): "Women . . . in ornate [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'decent'] apparel, adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire": whence we are given to understand that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not forbidden to adorn themselves soberly and moderately but to do so excessively, shamelessly, and immodestly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> is speaking of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> painting themselves: this is a kind of falsification, which cannot be devoid of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. ccxlv ad Possid.): "To dye oneself with paints in order to have a rosier or a paler complexion is a lying counterfeit. I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether even their husbands are willing to be deceived by it, by whom alone" (i.e. the husbands) "are they to be permitted, but not ordered, to adorn themselves." However, such painting does not always involve a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only when it is done for the sake of sensuous pleasure or in contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is to like cases that <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> refers.

<p>It must, however, be observed that it is one thing to counterfeit a beauty one has not, and another to hide a disfigurement arising from some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> such as sickness or the like. For this is lawful, since according to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 12:23</a>), "such as we think to be the less honorable members of the body, about these we put more abundant <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated in the foregoing Article, outward apparel should be consistent with the estate of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, according to the general custom. Hence it is in itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to wear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> clothes, or vice versa; especially since this may be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sensuous pleasure; and it is expressly forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm">Deuteronomy 22</a>) because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> used to practice this change of attire for the purpose of idolatrous superstition. Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of some <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the case of an art directed to the production of goods which men cannot use without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it follows that the workmen <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in making such things, as directly affording others an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for instance, if a man were to make <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> or anything pertaining to idolatrous worship. But in the case of an art the products of which may be employed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> either for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use, such as swords, arrows, and the like, the practice of such an art is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. These alone should be called arts; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Hom. xlix super Matth.]: "The name of art should be applied to those only which contribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life." On the case of an art that produces things which for the most part some people put to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use, although such arts are not unlawful in themselves, nevertheless, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, they should be extirpated from the State by the governing authority. Accordingly, since <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may lawfully adorn themselves, whether to maintain the fitness of their estate, or even by adding something thereto, in order to please their husbands, it follows that those who make such means of adornment do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the practice of their art, except perhaps by inventing means that are superfluous and fantastic. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says (Super Matth.) that "even the shoemakers' and clothiers' arts stand in need of restraint, for they have lent their art to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, by abusing its needs, and debasing art by art."
