<h1>Question 16. The precepts of faith, knowledge and understanding</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3016.htm#article1"> The precepts concerning faith</a> <li><a href="../summa/3016.htm#article2"> The precepts concerning the gifts of knowledge and understanding</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether in the Old Law there should have been given precepts of faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, there should have been given precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because a precept is about something due and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Now it is most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>, "Without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Therefore there was very great need for precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be given.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is contained in the Old, as the reality in the figure, as stated above (I-II, 107, 3). Now the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains explicit precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for instance <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John 14:1</a>: "You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Me." Therefore it seems that some precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to have been given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to prescribe the act of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comes to the same as to forbid the opposite <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained many precepts forbidding unbelief: thus (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse3">Exodus 20:3</a>): "Thou shalt not have strange gods before Me," and (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>) they were forbidden to hear the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or dreamer who might wish to turn them away from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should have been given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> also.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, confession is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as stated above (Question 3, Article 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contained precepts about the confession and the promulgation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for they were commanded (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse27">Exodus 12:27</a>) that, when their children should ask them, they should tell them the meaning of the paschal observance, and (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 13:9</a>) they were commanded to slay anyone who disseminated doctrine contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should have contained precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all the books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are contained in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse25">John 15:25</a>) that it was written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: "They have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Me without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>," although this is found written in <a href="../bible/psa034.htm">Psalm 34</a> and <a href="../bible/psa068.htm">68</a>. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse8">Sirach 2:8</a>): "Ye that fear the Lord, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> should have contained precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse27">Romans 3:27</a>) calls the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of works" which he contrasts with the "<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> ought not to have contained precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A master does not impose laws on others than his subjects; wherefore the precepts of a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> presuppose that everyone who receives the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is subject to the giver of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Now the primary subjection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>: "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is." Hence <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is presupposed to the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: for which reason (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse2">Exodus 20:2</a>) that which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is set down before the legal precepts, in the words, "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, Who brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>," and, likewise (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), the words, "Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord thy [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'our'] <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one," precede the recording of the precepts.

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> contains many things subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, which is the first and chief of all <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, as stated above (1, 1,7), it follows that, if we presuppose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind is subjected to Him, it is possible for precepts to be given about other <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> expounding the words: "This is My commandment" (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse12">John 15:12</a>) says (Tract. lxxxiii in Joan.) that we have received many precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, however, the secret things of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were not to be set before the people, wherefore, presupposing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no other precepts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as being the principle of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> life, wherefore it is presupposed before the receiving of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Even then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> both presupposed something of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He said: "You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and commanded something, namely, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> whereby one Person is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. This explanation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, wherefore He added: "Believe also in Me."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The prohibitive precepts regard <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which corrupt <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is corrupted by any particular defect, as stated above (I-II, 18, 4, ad 3; I-II, 19, 6, ad 1, 7, ad 3). Therefore <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being presupposed, prohibitive precepts had to be given in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, so that men might be warned off those particular defects whereby their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be corrupted.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the teaching thereof also presuppose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> could contain precepts relating to the confession and teaching of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rather than to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In this passage again that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is presupposed whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is; hence it begins, "Ye that fear the Lord," which is not possible without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The words which follow--"<a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him"--must be referred to certain special <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, chiefly to those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promises to them that obey Him, wherefore the passage concludes--"and your reward shall not be made void."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the precepts referring to knowledge and understanding were fittingly set down in the Old Law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts referring to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding were unfittingly set down in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding pertain to cognition. Now cognition precedes and directs action. Therefore the precepts referring to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding should precede the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> referring to action. Since, then, the first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> are those of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, it seems that precepts of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding should have been given a place among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, learning precedes teaching, for a man must learn from another before he teaches another. Now the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> contains precepts about teaching--both affirmative precepts as, for example, (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>), "Thou shalt teach them to thy sons"--and prohibitive precepts, as, for instance, (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>), "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it." Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ought to have been given also some precepts directing him to learn.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding seem more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> than to a king, wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a>): "The lips of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and they shall seek the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at his mouth," and (<a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse6">Hosea 4:6</a>): "Because thou hast rejected <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to Me." Now the king is commanded to learn <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse18">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>). Much more therefore should the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> have commanded the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to learn the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is not possible while asleep to meditate on things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding: moreover it is hindered by extraneous occupations. Therefore it is unfittingly commanded (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>): "Thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and rising." Therefore the precepts relating to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding are unfittingly set down in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>): "That, hearing all these precepts, they may say, Behold a wise and understanding people."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Three things may be considered in relation to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding: first, the reception thereof; secondly, the use; and thirdly, their preservation. Now the reception of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or understanding, is by means of teaching and learning, and both are prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>): "These words which I command thee . . . shall be in thy heart." This refers to learning, since it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a disciple to apply his mind to what is said, while the words that follow--"and thou shalt tell them to thy children"--refer to teaching.

<p>The use of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding is the meditation on those things which one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or understands. On reference to this, the text goes on: "thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house," etc.

<p>Their preservation is effected by the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and, as regards this, the text continues--"and thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes. And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors of thy house." Thus the continual remembrance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> commandments is signified, since it is impossible for us to forget those things which are continually attracting the notice of our senses, whether by touch, as those things we hold in our hands, or by sight, as those things which are ever before our eyes, or to which we are continually returning, for instance, to the house door. Moreover it is clearly stated (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>): "Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life."

<p>We read of these things also being commanded more notably in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, both in the teaching of the Gospel and in that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> According to <a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>, "this is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." By this we are given to understand that the wisdom and understanding of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consist in the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Wherefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> had to be given first, and afterwards men had to be led to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and understand them, and so it was not fitting that the aforesaid precepts should be placed among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> which take the first place.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are also in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> precepts relating to learning, as stated above. Nevertheless teaching was commanded more expressly than learning, because it concerned the learned, who were not under any other authority, but were immediately under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and to them the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> were given. On the other hand learning concerned the people of lower degree, and these the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> have to reach through the learned.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> is so closely bound up with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office that being charged with the office implies being charged to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>: hence there was no need for special precepts to be given about the training of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On the other hand, the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> is not so bound up with the kingly office, because a king is placed over his people in temporal matters: hence it is especially commanded that the king should be instructed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> about things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> That precept of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> does not mean that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should meditate on <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> of sleeping, but during sleep, i.e. that he should meditate on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when he is preparing to sleep, because this leads to his having better phantasms while asleep, in so far as our movements pass from the state of vigil to the state of sleep, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> explains (Ethic. i, 13). On like manner we are commanded to meditate on the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> in every action of ours, not that we are bound to be always actually thinking about the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, but that we should regulate all our actions according to it.
