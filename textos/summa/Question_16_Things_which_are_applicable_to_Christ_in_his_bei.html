<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether this is true: "God is man"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." For every affirmative proposition of remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Now this proposition, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," is on remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, since the forms signified by the subject and predicate are most widely apart. Therefore, since the aforesaid proposition is affirmative, it would seem to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the three Divine Persons are in greater mutual agreement than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the Divine. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> one Person is not predicated of another; for we do not say that the Father is the Son, or conversely. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ought not to be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by saying that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Symb. Fid.) that, "as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the flesh are one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the body." Therefore this also is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it was said in I, 39, 4 that what is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not relatively but absolutely, belongs to the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and to each of the Persons. But this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is not relative, but absolute. Hence, if it is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would follow that the whole <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and each of the Persons is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians 2:6-7</a>): "Who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> found as a man"; and thus He Who is in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now He Who is in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This proposition "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," is admitted by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, yet not in the same way by all. For some admit the proposition, but not in the proper acceptation of the terms. Thus the Manicheans say the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but fictitious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as they say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> assumed an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> body, and thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a bronze figure is called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> if it has the figure of a man. So, too, those who held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were not united, could not say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that He is figuratively called <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of the parts. Now both these opinions were disproved above (2, 5; 5, 1).

<p>Some, on the contrary, hold the reality on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but deny the reality on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, but by participation, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; even as all other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are called gods--<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being more excellently so than the rest, on account of His more abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And thus, when it is said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not stand for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinus</a>, which was disproved above (2, 10,11). But some admit this proposition, together with the reality of both terms, holding that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; yet they do not preserve the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the predication. For they say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of a certain conjunction either of dignity, or of authority, or of affection or indwelling. It was thus that <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> held <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>--nothing further being meant than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is joined to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by such a conjunction that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is dwelt in by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and united to Him in affection, and in a share of the Divine authority and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And into the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> fall those who suppose two supposita or hypostases in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since it is impossible to understand how, of two things distinct in suppositum or hypostasis, one can be properly predicated of the other: unless merely by a figurative expression, inasmuch as they are united in something, as if we were to say that Peter is John because they are somehow mutually joined together. And these opinions also were disproved above (2, 3,6).

<p>Hence, supposing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is united with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> not only in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but also in suppositum or hypostasis; we say that this proposition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"--not only by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its terms, i.e. because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the predication. For a word signifying the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the concrete may stand for all contained in the common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" may stand for any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And thus this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," from its very mode of signification, may stand for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as was said in I, 39, 4. Now of every suppositum of any <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> we may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly predicate a word signifying that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the concrete, as "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" may properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be predicated of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Hence, since the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> for Whom this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" stands, is a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> this word <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly predicated of this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as it stands for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When different forms cannot come together in one suppositum, the proposition is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> in remote <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the subject signifying one form and the predicate another. But when two forms can come together in one suppositum, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not remote, but <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, as when I say: "Something white is musical." Now the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, although most widely apart, nevertheless come together by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> in one suppositum, in which neither <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but [both] <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Hence this proposition is neither in remote nor in <a href="../cathen/04331a.htm">contingent</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, as being predicated of its hypostasis--not, indeed, by reason of the form signified by this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," but by reason of the suppositum, which is a hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The three Divine Persons agree in one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and are distinguished in suppositum; and hence they are not predicated one of another. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, being distinct, are not predicated one of the other, in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>. For the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But because they agree in suppositum, they are predicated of each other in the concrete.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> "Soul" and "flesh" are taken in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, even as Godhead and manhood; but in the concrete we say "animate" and "carnal" or "corporeal," as, on the other hand, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Hence in both cases the abstract is not predicated of the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but only the concrete of the concrete.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> This word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" is predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because of the union in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and this union implies a relation. Hence it does not follow the rule of those words which are absolutely predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether this is true: "Man is God"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an incommunicable name; hence (<a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse10">Wisdom 13:10</a>; <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#verse21">14:21</a>) idolaters are rebuked for giving the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is incommunicable, to wood and stones. Hence with equal reason does it seem unbecoming that this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" should be predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is predicated of the predicate may be predicated of the subject. But this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father," or "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." Therefore, if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," it seems that this also is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Man is the Father," or "Man is the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>." But these are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore the first is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/psa080.htm#verse10">Psalm 80:10</a>): "There shall be no new <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in thee." But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is something new; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not always <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans 9:5</a>): "Of whom is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh, Who is over all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed for ever." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the flesh, is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Granted the reality of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, i.e. Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and of the union in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and hypostasis, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper: "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," even as this: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." For this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" may stand for any hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and thus it may stand for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Whom we say is a hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now it is manifest that the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly predicated of the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as was said in I, 39, 4. Hence it remains that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper: "Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Idolaters attributed the name of the Deity to stones and wood, considered in their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, because they thought there was something divine in them. But we do not attribute the name of the Deity to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum, which by union is a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This word "Father" is predicated of this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," inasmuch as this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" stands for the Person of the Father. And in this way it is not predicated of the Person of the Son, because the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is not the Person of the Father. And, consequently, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that this word "Father" be predicated of this word "Man," of which the Word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is predicated, inasmuch as "Man" stands for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is something new, yet the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not new, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And because this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is predicated of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not on account of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by reason of the suppositum, it does not follow that we assert a new <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this would follow, if we held that "Man" stands for a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> suppositum: even as must be said by those who assert that there are two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> [Cf. 02, 3,6].

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Christ can be called a lordly man?</h2> <em>[The question is hardly apposite in English. St. Thomas explains why we can say in Latin, e.g. 'oratio dominica' (the Lord's Prayer) or 'passio dominica' (Our Lord's Passion), but not speak of our Lord as 'homo dominicus' (a lordly man)].</em>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can be called a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "we are to be counseled to hope for the goods that were in the Lordly Man"; and he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, as lordship belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, so does manhood belong to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be "humanized," as is plain from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 11), where he says that "being humanized manifests the conjunction with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Hence with like reason may it be said denominatively that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is lordly.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, as "lordly" is derived from "lord," so is Divine derived from "Deus" [<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>]. But <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Eccl. Hier. iv) calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the "most Divine Jesus." Therefore with like reason may <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be called a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Retract. i, 19): "I do not see that we may rightly call <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since He is the Lord Himself."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said above (2, ad 3), when we say "the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," we signify the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum, which is the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because there is only one suppositum of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and "Lord" are predicated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and hence they ought not to be predicated denominatively, since this is derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the union. Hence, since we say "lordly" denominatively from lord, it cannot <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly be said that this Man is lordly, but rather that He is Lord. But if, when we say "the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>," we mean a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> suppositum, as those who assert two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might be called lordly, inasmuch as he is assumed to a participation of Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as the Nestorians said. And, even in this way, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not called "divine" by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but "deified"--not, indeed, by its being converted into the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but by its conjunction with the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> in one hypostasis, as is plain from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. iii, 11,17).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> retracts these and the like words (Retract. i, 19); hence, after the foregoing words (Retract. i, 19), he adds: "Wherever I have said this," viz. that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> is a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "I wish it unsaid, having afterwards seen that it ought not to be said although it may be defended with some reason," i.e. because one might say that He was called a lordly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies, and not by reason of the suppositum.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This one suppositum, which is of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, was first of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, i.e. from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Afterwards in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it was made a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. And for this reason it is said to be "humanized"--not that it assumed a man, but that it assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the converse of this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, viz. that a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> assumed the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; hence we may not say a "deified" or "lordly" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This word Divine is wont to be predicated even of things of which the word <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is predicated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>; thus we say that "the Divine Essence is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," by reason of identity; and that "the Essence belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," or is "Divine," on account of the different way of signifying; and we speak of the "<a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a>," though the Word is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So, too, we say "a Divine Person," just as we say "the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>," on account of its different mode of signification. But "lordly" is not predicated of those of which "lord" is predicated; for we are not wont to call a man who is a lord, lordly; but whatsoever belongs to a lord is called lordly, as the "lordly will," or the "lordly hand," or the "lordly possession." And hence the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, cannot be called lordly; yet His flesh can be called "lordly flesh" and His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> the "lordly passion."

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether what belongs to the human nature can be predicated of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For contrary things cannot be said of the same. Now, what belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is contrary to what is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is uncreated, immutable, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> temporal and mutable. Therefore what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to attribute to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what is defective seems to be derogatory to the Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and to be a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Now what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> contains a kind of defect, as to suffer, to die, and the like. Hence it seems that what pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can nowise be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, to be assumed pertains to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; yet it does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> assumed the idioms," i.e. the properties, "of flesh, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be passible, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was crucified."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> On this question there was a difference of opinion between Nestorians and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Nestorians wished to divide words predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in this way, viz. that such as pertained to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should not be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that such as pertained to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> should not be predicated of the Man. Hence <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> said: "If anyone attempt to attribute sufferings to the Word, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" [Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 29]. But if there are any words applicable to both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, of them they predicated what pertained to both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, as "Christ" or "Lord." Hence they granted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was born of a Virgin, and that He was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but they did not say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, or that the Man was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the other hand maintained that words which are said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> either in His Divine or in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be said either of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence Cyril says [Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 26]: "If anyone ascribes to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>," i.e. hypostases, "such words as are in the evangelical and apostolic <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, or have been said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the Saints, or by Himself of Himself, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that some are to be applied to the Man, and apportions some to the Word alone--let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." And the reason of this is that, since there is one hypostasis of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the same hypostasis is signified by the name of either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus whether we say "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the hypostasis of Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is signified. And hence, of the Man may be said what belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, as of a hypostasis of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be said what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as of a hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that in a proposition in which something is predicated of another, we must not merely consider what the predicate is predicated of, but also the reason of its being predicated. Thus, although we do not distinguish things predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet we distinguish that by reason of which they are predicated, since those things that belong to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> are predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and those that belong to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 11): "We must distinguish what is said by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> in reference to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein He is equal to the Father, and what in reference to the form of a servant, wherein He is less than the Father": and further on he says (De Trin. i, 13): "The <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, careful, and devout reader will discern the reason and point of view of what is said."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is impossible for contraries to be predicated of the same in the same respects, but nothing prevents their being predicated of the same in different aspects. And thus contraries are predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not in the same, but in different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> If the things pertaining to defect were attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, it would be a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, since it would be derogatory to His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. But there is no kind of wrong done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if they are attributed to Him in His assumed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence in a discourse of the Council of Ephesus [Part III, ch. 10] it is said: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accounts nothing a wrong which is the occasion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For no lowliness that He assumed for us injures that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> which can be subject to no injury, yet makes lower things Its own, to save our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore, since these lowly and worthless things do no harm to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but bring about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, how dost thou maintain that what was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was the occasion of harm to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?"

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To be assumed pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not in its suppositum, but in itself; and thus it does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether what belongs to the human nature can be predicated of the Divine Nature?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can be said of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. Therefore, what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be predicated of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the flesh pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6), "we say, after the <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">blessed Athanasius</a> and Cyril, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> of the Word was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a>." Therefore it would seem with equal reason that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may be said of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, what belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; such as to <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> future things and to possess saving power. Therefore it would seem with equal reason that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> may be said of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4): "When we mention the Godhead we do not predicate of it the idioms," i.e. the properties, "of the humanity; for we do not say that the Godhead is passible or creatable."

Therefore what is proper to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be said of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> What belongs to one cannot be said of another, unless they are both the same; thus "risible" can be predicated only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures are not the same; but the hypostasis of the two natures is the same. And hence what belongs to one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be predicated of the other if they are taken in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>. Now concrete words stand for the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and hence of concrete words we may predicate indifferently what belongs to either <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--whether the word of which they are predicated refers to one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as the word "Christ," by which is signified "both the Godhead anointing and the manhood anointed"; or to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> alone, as this word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" or "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; or to the manhood alone, as this word "Man" or "<a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Jesus</a>." Hence Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Palaest. cxxiv): "It is of no consequence from what <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> we name <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; because since the unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> remains inseparably, one and the same is altogether <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> by His flesh, and altogether <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by the Godhead which He has with the Father."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Person and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> are really the same; and by reason of this identity the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is predicated of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Nevertheless, its mode of predication is different; and hence certain things are said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> which are not said of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>; thus we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is born, yet we do not say that the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is born; as was said in I, 39, 5. So, too, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> suffered, yet we do not say that the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> suffered.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> implies union with flesh, rather than any property of flesh. Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> each <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to the other in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; and by reason of this union the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> deified, as stated above (2, 1, ad 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> What belongs to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is predicated of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--not, indeed, as it belongs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but as it is participated by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, whatever cannot be participated by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (as to be uncreated and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>), is nowise predicated of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> received nothing by participation from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and hence what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can nowise be predicated of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to be made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be changed. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be the subject of change, according to <a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi 3:6</a>: "I am the Lord, and I change not."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> stands for the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a>): "The Word was made flesh": and as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> says (Ep. ad Epictetum), "when he said, 'The Word was made flesh,' it is as if it were said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A thing is said to be made that which begins to be predicated of it for the first time. Now to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), yet in such sort that it pertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but from the time of His assuming <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; though it is understood differently by some: even as this, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," as we said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To be made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be made simply, in all those in whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> begins to be in a newly <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> suppositum. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have been made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> began to be in an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> suppositum of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. And hence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not mean that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made simply.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above, to be made implies that something. is newly predicated of another. Hence, whenever anything is predicated of another, and there is a change in that of which it is predicated, then to be made is to be changed; and this takes place in whatever is predicated absolutely, for whiteness or greatness cannot newly affect anything, unless it be newly changed to whiteness or greatness. But whatever is predicated relatively can be newly predicated of anything without its change, as a man may be made to be on the right side without being changed and merely by the change of him on whose left side he was. Hence in such cases, not all that is said to be made is changed, since it may happen by the change of something else. And it is thus we say of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "Lord, Thou art made [<a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay</a>: 'hast been'] our refuge" (<a href="../bible/psa089.htm#verse1">Psalm 89:1</a>). Now to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of the union, which is a relation. And hence to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is newly predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without any change in Him, by a change in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is assumed to a Divine Person. And hence, when it is said, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," we understand no change on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only on the part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Man stands not for the bare Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but inasmuch as it subsists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, although this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>," yet this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" by being united to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether this is true: "Man was made God"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For it is written (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse2">Romans 1:2-3</a>): "Which He had promised before by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, concerning His Son Who was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh." Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is of the seed of David according to the flesh. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 13) that "such was this assumption, which made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." But by reason of this assumption this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore, in like manner, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Ep. ad Chelid. ci): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was humanized and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was deified, or whatever else one may like to call it." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to be humanized by being made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore with equal reason <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is said to be deified by being made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, when it is said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," the subject of the making or uniting is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which the word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" signifies. Now that seems to be the subject of the making, to which the making is attributed. Hence "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is truer than "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 2): "We do not say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was deified, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was humanized." Now to be made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the same as to be deified. Hence this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This proposition, Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be understood in three ways. First, so that the participle "made" absolutely determines either the subject or the predicate; and in this sense it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, since neither the Man of Whom it is predicated was made, nor is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, as will be said (8,9). And in the same sense this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." But it is not of this sense that we are now speaking. Secondly, it may be so understood that the word "made" determines the composition, with this meaning: "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. it was brought about that Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." And in this sense both are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, viz. that "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made Man." But this is not the proper sense of these phrases; unless, indeed, we are to understand that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" has not a personal but a simple supposition. For although "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" was not made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because this suppositum, viz. the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, speaking commonly, was not always <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thirdly, properly understood, this participle "made" attaches making to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the term of the making. And in this sense, granted that the Person or hypostasis in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are the same as the suppositum of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man, as was shown (2, 2,3), this proposition is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because, when it is said, "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" has a personal suppositum: because, to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not verified of the Man in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but in His suppositum. Now the suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of Whom "to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" is verified, is the same as the hypostasis or Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who was always <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it cannot be said that this Man began to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or is made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that He was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>But if there were a different hypostasis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that "to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" was predicated of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, conversely, by reason of a certain conjunction of supposita, or of personal dignity, or of affection or indwelling, as the Nestorians said, then with equal reason might it be said that Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made Man, i.e. joined to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In these words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> the relative "Who" which refers to the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ought not to be considered as affecting the predicate, as if someone already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> of the "seed of David according to the flesh" was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>--and it is in this sense that the objection takes it. But it ought to be taken as affecting the subject, with this meaning--that the "<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made to Him ('namely to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the Father,' as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> expounds it), being of the seed of David according to the flesh," as if to say "the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> having flesh of the seed of David to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is to be taken in the sense that by the assumption that took place in <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> it was brought about that Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Man; and in this sense both sayings are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as stated above.

<p>The same is to be said in reply to the third, since to be deified is the same as to be made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> A term placed in the subject is taken materially, i.e. for the suppositum; placed in the predicate it is taken formally, i.e. for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> signified. Hence when it is said that "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," the being made is not attributed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but to the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, Which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and hence it does not befit Him to be made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when it is said that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made Man," the making is taken to be terminated in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence, properly speaking, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made Man," and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "Man was made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; even as if <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, who was already a man, were made white, and were pointed out, this would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made white today," and this would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; "This white thing was made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> today." Nevertheless, if on the part of the subject there is added some word signifying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, it might be taken in this way for the subject of the making, e.g. if it were said that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was made the Son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>."

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether this is true: "Christ is a creature"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature." For Pope Leo says [Cf. Append. Opp. August., Serm. xii de Nativ.]: "A new and unheard of covenant: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is and was, is made a creature." Now we may predicate of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whatever the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Therefore this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the properties of both natures may be predicated of the common hypostasis of both <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, no <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> by what word they are signified, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). But it is the property of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, as it is the property of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to be Creator. Hence both may be said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, viz. that He is a creature and that he is uncreated and Creator.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the principal part of a man is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than the body. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by reason of the body which He took from the Virgin, is said simply to be born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>. Therefore by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it ought simply to be said that He is a creature.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says (De Trin. i): "Was Christ made by a word? Was Christ <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> by a command?" as if to say: "No!" Hence he adds: "How can there be a creature in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has a simple not a composite <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>." Therefore it must not be granted that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Gloss, Ord. in <a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse16">Hosea 2:16</a>] says, "words spoken amiss lead to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>"; hence with us and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the very words ought not to be in common, lest we seem to countenance their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Now the Arian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a creature and less than the Father, not only in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but even in His Divine Person. And hence we must not say absolutely that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a "creature" or "less than the Father"; but with a qualification, viz. "in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." But such things as could not be considered to belong to the Divine Person in Itself may be predicated simply of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by reason of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; thus we say simply that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered, died and was buried: even as in corporeal and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, things of which we may <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether they belong to the whole or the part, if they are observed to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in a part, are not predicated of the whole simply, i.e. without qualification, for we do not say that the Ethiopian is white but that he is white as regards his teeth; but we say without qualification that he is curly, since this can only belong to him as regards his hair.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes, for the sake of brevity, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> use the word "creature" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without any qualifying term; we should however take as understood the qualification, "as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All the properties of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, just as of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, may be predicated equally of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Who <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man, is called <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and uncreated, passible and impassible." Nevertheless things of which we may <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to what <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> they belong, are not to be predicated without a qualification. Hence he afterwards adds (De Fide Orth. iv, 5) that "the one hypostasis," i.e. of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "is uncreated in its Godhead and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in its manhood": even so conversely, we may not say without qualification, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is incorporeal" or "impassible"; in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Manes, who held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> suffered, but we must say, with a qualification, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was incorporeal and impassible "in His Godhead."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> how the birth from the Virgin applies to the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as there can be in the case of creation; and hence there is no parity.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether this Man, i.e. Christ, began to be?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this Man, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, began to be. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. cv in Joan.) that "before the world was, neither were we, nor the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men--the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." But what was not always, has begun to be. Therefore this Man, i.e. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, began to be.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to be Man. But to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to be simply. Therefore this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> began to be, simply.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" implies a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not always a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore this Man began to be.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse8">Hebrews 13:8</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> yesterday and today: and the same for ever."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We must not say that "this Man"--pointing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--"began to be," unless we add something. And this for a twofold reason. First, for this proposition is simply <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, in the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, which affirms that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is one suppositum and one hypostasis, as also one Person. For according to this, when we say "this Man," pointing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessarily</a> meant, with Whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> a beginning in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is incompatible. Hence this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "This Man began to be." Nor does it matter that to begin to be refers to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is signified by this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; because the term placed in the subject is not taken formally so as to signify the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is taken materially so as to signify the suppositum, as was said (1, ad 4). Secondly, because even if this proposition were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it ought not to be made use of without qualification; in order to avoid the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who, since he pretended that the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a creature, and less than the Father, so he maintained that He began to be, saying "there was a time when He was not."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The words quoted must be qualified, i.e. we must say that the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was not, before the world was, "in His humanity."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> With this word "begin" we cannot argue from the lower <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to the higher. For it does not follow if "this began to be white," that therefore "it began to be colored." And this because "to begin" implies being now and not heretofore: for it does not follow if "this was not white hitherto" that "therefore it was not colored hitherto." Now, to be simply is higher than to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence this does not follow: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to be Man--therefore He began to be."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This word "Man," as it is taken for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it signifies the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which began to be, nevertheless signifies the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum which did not begin to be. Hence, since it signifies the suppositum when placed in the subject, and refers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when placed in the predicate, therefore this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "The Man Christ began to be": but this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> began to be Man."

<h2 id="article10">Article 10. Whether this is true: "Christ as Man is a creature"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature," or "began to be." For nothing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> except the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Therefore this is also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the predicate is predicated of the term placed in reduplication, rather than of the subject of the proposition; as when I say: "A body as colored is visible," it follows that the colored is visible. But as stated (8,9) we must not absolutely grant that "the Man Christ is a creature"; nor consequently that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature."

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is predicated of a man as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is predicated of him "per se" and simply, for "per se" is the same as "inasmuch as itself," as is said Metaph. v, text. 23. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is per se and simply a creature." Hence this, too, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature."

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is, is either Creator or creature. But this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is Creator." Therefore this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> When we say "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man" this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" may be added in the reduplication, either by reason of the suppositum or by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If it be added by reason of the suppositum, since the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and uncreated, this will be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature." But if it be added by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it belongs to Him to be a creature, as was said (8).

<p>It must however be borne in mind that the term covered by the reduplication signifies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than the suppositum, since it is added as a predicate, which is taken formally, for it is the same to say "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man" and to say "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as He is a Man." Hence this is to be granted rather than denied: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature." But if something further be added whereby [the term covered by the reduplication] is attracted to the suppositum, this proposition is to be denied rather than granted, for instance were one to say: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as 'this' Man is a creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the word "creature" is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> predicated not only of <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but also of concrete things; since we say that "manhood is a creature" and that "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Man as placed in the subject refers to the suppositum--and as placed in the reduplication refers to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as was stated above. And because the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and the suppositum uncreated, therefore, although it is not granted that "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a creature," yet it is granted that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a creature."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It belongs to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is a suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> alone to have his being only in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence of every such suppositum it follows that if it is a creature as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is a creature simply. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a suppositum not merely of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, in which He has an uncreated being. Hence it does not follow that, if He is a creature as Man, He is a creature simply.

<h2 id="article11">Article 11. Whether this is true: "Christ as Man is God"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Man, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Man, has the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse25">Isaiah 43:25</a>: "I am He that blot out thy iniquities for My own sake." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew 9:6</a>: "But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> hath power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," etc. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not Man in common, but is this particular Man. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as this Man, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since by "this Man" we signify the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suppositum which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man belongs to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> This term "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" when placed in the reduplication may be taken in two ways. First as referring to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and in this way it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is distinct from the Divine by a difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Secondly it may be taken as referring to the suppositum; and in this way, since the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to Whom it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> belongs to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Man, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nevertheless because the term placed in the reduplication signifies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rather than the suppositum, as stated above (<a href="#10">Article 10</a>), hence this is to be denied rather than granted: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is not with regard to the same, that a thing moves towards, and that it is, something; for to move belongs to a thing because of its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> or subject--and to be in act belongs to it because of its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. So too it is not with regard to the same, that it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be ordained to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union, and to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the first belongs to Him in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and the second, in His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. Hence this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man has the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of union"; yet not this: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has on earth the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by virtue of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, in which Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> resides the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> authoritatively; whereas in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it resides instrumentally and ministerially. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> expounding this passage says [Implicitly. Hom. xxx in Matth; cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, Catena Aurea on <a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse10">Mark 2:10</a>]: "He said pointedly 'on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,' in order to show that by an indivisible union He united <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the power of the Godhead, since although He was made Man, yet He remained the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When we say "this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," the demonstrative pronoun "this" attracts "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" to the suppositum; and hence "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as this Man, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a truer proposition than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<h2 id="article12">Article 12. Whether this is true: "Christ as Man is a hypostasis or person"?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. For what belongs to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man, since He is like other men according to <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a>: "Being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>." But every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But He is not a universal <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>: therefore He is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is nothing else than an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.). Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a being of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and a suppositum and a hypostasis of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But every hypostasis and suppositum and being of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is not an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Therefore if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> it would follow that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>--one temporal and the other <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, as was said above (2, 6; 4, 2).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As was said (10,11), the term "Man" placed in the reduplication may refer either to the suppositum or to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence when it is said: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>," if it is taken as referring to the suppositum, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since the suppositum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is nothing else than the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But if it be taken as referring to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, it may be understood in two ways. First, we may so understand it as if it belonged to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to be in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and in this way it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for whatever subsists in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Secondly it may be taken that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a proper personality, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and in this way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> of itself apart from the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and yet the notion of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> requires this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It belongs to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, inasmuch as everything subsisting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Now this is proper to the Man Christ that the Person subsisting in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the principles of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Hence in one way He is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as Man; and in another way He is not, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>," which is included in the definition of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, implies a complete <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> subsisting of itself and separate from all else; otherwise, a man's hand might be called a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since it is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; nevertheless, because it is an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> in something else, it cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; nor, for the same reason, can the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it may be called something <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and singular.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> signifies something complete and self-subsisting in rational <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so a hypostasis, suppositum, and being of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the genus of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, signify something that subsists of itself. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not of itself a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> apart from the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so likewise it is not of itself a hypostasis or suppositum or a being of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence in the sense in which we deny that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Man is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" we must deny all the other propositions.
