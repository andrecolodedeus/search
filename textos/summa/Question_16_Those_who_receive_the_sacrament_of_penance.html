<h1>Question 16. Those who receive the sacrament of penance</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5016.htm#article1"> Can penance be in the innocent?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5016.htm#article2"> Can it be in the saints in glory?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5016.htm#article3"> In the good or bad angels?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether penance can be in the innocent?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that penance cannot be in the innocent. For penance consists in bewailing one's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: whereas the innocent have done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Therefore penance cannot be in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the very name of penance [poenitentia] implies punishment [poena]. But the innocent do not deserve punishment. Therefore penance is not in them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, penance coincides with vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But if all were innocent, there would be no room for vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore there would be no penance, so that there is none in the innocent.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> All the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused together. But penance is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Since, therefore, other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are infused into the innocent at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, penance is infused with them.

<p>Further, a man is said to be curable though he has never been sick in body: therefore in like manner, one who has never been sick spiritually. Now even as there can be no actual cure from the wound of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without an act of penance, so is there no possibility of cure without the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance. Therefore one who has never had the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Habit comes between power and act: and since the removal of what precedes entails the removal of what follows, but not conversely, the removal of the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> ensues from the removal of the power to act, but not from the removal of the act. And because removal of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> entails the removal of the act, since there can be no act without the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into which it passes, hence the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is possible in one for whom the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is not available, for the reason that it can be available, so that the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can proceed to its act--thus a poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of magnificence, but not the act, because he is not possessed of great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of magnificence, but he can be possessed thereof.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although the innocent have committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nevertheless they can, so that they are competent to have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance. Yet this <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> can never proceed to its act, except perhaps with regard to their venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> destroy the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Nevertheless it is not without its purpose, because it is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although they deserve no punishment actually, yet it is possible for something to be in them for which they would deserve to be punished.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> So long as the power to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remains, there would be room for vindictive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, though not as to the act, if there were no actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the saints in glory have penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> have not penance. For, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. iv), "the blessed remember their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even as we, without grief, remember our griefs after we have been healed." But penance is grief of the heart. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> have not penance.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are conformed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But there was no penance in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since there was no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is the principle of penance. Therefore there will be no penance in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is useless if it is not reduced to its act. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will not repent actually, because, if they did, there would be something in them against their wish. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance will not be in them.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, penance is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is "perpetual and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>" (<a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse15">Wisdom 1:15</a>), and will remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore penance will also.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, we read in the Lives of the Fathers, that one of them said that even <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> will repent of not having done more <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But one ought to repent of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done more than of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> left undone, and which one was not bound to do, for such is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in question. Therefore repentance will be there of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> will remain in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but only as regards the acts which they exercise in respect of their end. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance is a part of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which is a cardinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whoever has the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of penance in this life, will have it in the life to come: but he will not have the same act as now, but another, viz. thanksgiving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His mercy in pardoning his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This argument proves that they do not have the same act as penance has now; and we grant this.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was lacking in His respect both <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actually and potentially</a>: so that there is no comparison between Him and others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Repentance, properly speaking, considered as that act of penance which is in this life, will not be in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and yet the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> will not be without its use, for it will have another act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objections 4 and 5.</strong> We grant the Fourth argument. But since the Fifth Objection proves that there will be the same act of penance in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as now, we answer the latter by saying that in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> one will be altogether conformed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by His antecedent will, but not by His consequent will, wishes that all things should be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and therefore that there should be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so is it with the blessed. It is this will that this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father improperly calls penance.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether an angel can be the subject of penance?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that even a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> can be a subject of penance. For fear is the beginning of penance. But fear is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James 2:19</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble." Therefore there can be penance in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Ethic. ix, 4) that "<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men are full of repentance, and this is a great punishment for them." Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">devils</a> are exceeding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor is there any punishment that they lack. Therefore they can repent.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a thing is more easily moved to that which is according to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than to that which is against its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: thus water which has by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> been heated, of itself returns to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> property. Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be moved to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contrary to their common <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Much more therefore can they return to that which is in accord with their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But this is done by penance. Therefore they are susceptible to penance.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, what applies to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, applies equally to separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 4). But there can be penance in separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as some say, as in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore there can be penance in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> By penance <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> obtains pardon for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he has committed. But this is impossible in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore they are not subjects of penance.

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 4) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is subject to penance on account of the weakness of his body. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not united to a body. Therefore no penance can be in them.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In us, penance is taken in two senses; first, as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, and thus it is nothing but pain or sorrow on account of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed: and though, as a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> it is only in the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> part, yet, by way of comparison, the name of penance is given to that act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, whereby a man detests what he has done, even as love and other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are spoken of as though they were in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Secondly, penance is taken as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and in this way its act consists in the detestation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done, together with the purpose of amendment and the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of expiating the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or of placating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the offense committed. Now detestation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> befits a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> according as he is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> ordained to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And since this order or inclination is not entirely destroyed in any creature, it remains even in the damned, and consequently the passion of repentance, or something like it, remains in them too, as stated in <a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse3">Wisdom 5:3</a> "(saying) within themselves, repenting," etc. This repentance, as it is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> or act, can by no means be in the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who have not committed any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but it is in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since the same applies to them as to the lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 4), "death is to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>." But no forgiveness is possible for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself which we call penance, in so far as it can be pardoned or expiated. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot have the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, they have not the power to produce the act, so that neither can they have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot be subjects of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of penance.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A certain movement of penance is engendered in them from fear, but not such as is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Whatever is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> in them is entirely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and inclines to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is fixed on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And since the movement of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> follows the inclination, not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, there is no need that there should be movements of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in them either actually or possibly, although they are inclined to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> There is no parity between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the beatified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, because in the latter there has been or could have been a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that could be pardoned, but not in the former: so that though they are like as to their present state, they differ as to their previous states, which penance regards directly.
