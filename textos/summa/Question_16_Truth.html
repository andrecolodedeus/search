<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether truth resides only in the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not reside only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but rather in things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Soliloq. ii, 5) condemns this definition of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, "That is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is seen"; since it would follow that stones hidden in the bosom of the earth would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> stones, as they are not seen. He also condemns the following, "That is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is as it appears to the knower, who is willing and able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>," for hence it would follow that nothing would be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unless someone could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Therefore he defines <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thus: "That is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is." It seems, then, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides in things, and not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If, then, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, nothing will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> except in so far as it is understood. But this is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who said that whatever seems to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is so. Consequently mutual contradictories seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as seen by different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at the same time.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "that, on account of which a thing is so, is itself more so," as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Poster. i). But it is from the fact that a thing is or is not, that our thought or word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> teaches (Praedicam. iii). Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides rather in things than in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi), " The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reside not in things, but in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> denotes that towards which the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends, so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> denotes that towards which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> tends. Now there is this difference between the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whatsoever, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is according as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is in the knower, whilst <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is according as the desirer tends towards the thing desired. Thus the term of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, is in the object desirable, and the term of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> itself. Now as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in a thing so far as that thing is related to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>--and hence the aspect of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> passes on from the desirable thing to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if its object is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; so, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in so far as it is conformed to the object understood, the aspect of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> must needs pass from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the object understood, so that also the thing understood is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as it has some relation to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now a thing understood may be in relation to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> either <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. It is related <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> on which it depends as regards its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by which it is knowable; even as we may say that a house is related <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the architect, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> upon which it does not depend.

<p>Now we do not judge of a thing by what is in it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, but by what is in it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>. Hence, everything is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> absolutely, in so far as it is related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from which it depends; and thus it is that artificial things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> a being related to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For a house is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that expresses the likeness of the form in the architect's mind; and words are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> so far as they are the signs of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In the same way <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as they express the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that are in the divine mind. For a stone is called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which possesses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> proper to a stone, according to the preconception in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Thus, then, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides primarily in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and secondarily in things according as they are related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as their principle. Consequently there are various definitions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. xxxvi), "Truth is that whereby is made manifest that which is;" and <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> says (De Trin. v) that "Truth makes being clear and evident" and this pertains to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things in so far as they are related to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, we have <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> definition (De Vera Relig. xxxvi), "Truth is a supreme likeness without any unlikeness to a principle": also <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm's</a> definition (De Verit. xii), "Truth is rightness, perceptible by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> alone"; for that is right which is in accordance with the principle; also <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna's</a> definition (Metaph. viii, 6), "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of each thing is a property of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which is immutably attached to it." The definition that "Truth is the equation of thought and thing" is applicable to it under either aspect.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things, and excludes from the notion of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, relation to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; for what is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> is excluded from every definition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held that the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things did not proceed from any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but were produced by chance. But as they saw that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> implies relation to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, they were compelled to base the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things on their relation to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. From this, conclusions result that are inadmissible, and which the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> refutes (Metaph. iv). Such, however, do not follow, if we say that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things consists in their relation to the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the thing, yet it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be there primarily, any more than that health should be primarily in medicine, rather than in the animal: for the virtue of medicine, and not its health, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health, for here the agent is not univocal. In the same way, the being of the thing, not its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says that a thought or a word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> "from the fact that a thing is, not because a thing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether truth resides only in the intellect composing and dividing?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not reside only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing. For the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii) that as the senses are always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as regards their proper sensible objects, so is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> as regards "what a thing is." Now composition and division are neither in the senses nor in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> "what a thing is." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not reside only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> says in his book On Definitions that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the equation of thought and thing. Now just as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with regard to complex things can be equated to things, so also with regard to simple things; and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also of sense apprehending a thing as it is. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not reside only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. vi) that with regard to simple things and "what a thing is," <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is "found neither in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> nor in things."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated before, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides, in its primary aspect, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now since everything is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> according as it has the form proper to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so far as it has the likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, this being its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>. For this reason <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is defined by the conformity of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and thing; and hence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this conformity is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But in no way can sense <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this. For although sight has the likeness of a visible thing, yet it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the comparison which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> between the thing seen and that which itself apprehends concerning it. But the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its own conformity with the intelligible thing; yet it does not apprehend it by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of a thing "what a thing is." When, however, it judges that a thing corresponds to the form which it apprehends about that thing, then first it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and expresses <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This it does by composing and dividing: for in every proposition it either applies to, or removes from the thing signified by the subject, some form signified by the predicate: and this clearly shows that the sense is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of any thing, as is also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> "what a thing is"; but it does not thereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or affirm <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This is in like manner the case with complex or non-complex words. Truth therefore may be in the senses, or in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> "what a thing is," as in anything that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; yet not as the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the knower, which is implied by the word "truth"; for the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Therefore, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing; and not in the senses; nor in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> "what a thing is."

<p>And thus the Objections given are solved.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the true and being are convertible terms?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and being are not convertible terms. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resides properly in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated (1); but being is properly in things. Therefore they are not convertible.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which extends to being and not-being is not convertible with being. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> extends to being and not-being; for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that what is, is; and that what is not, is not. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and being are not convertible.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, things which stand to each other in order of priority and posteriority seem not to be convertible. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> appears to be prior to being; for being is not understood except under the aspect of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore it seems they are not convertible.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. ii) that there is the same disposition of things in being and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of what is desirable, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is related to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now everything, in as far as it has being, so far is it knowable. Wherefore it is said in De Anima iii that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in some manner all things," through the senses and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And therefore, as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is convertible with being, so is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> adds to being the notion of desirable, so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adds relation to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resides in things and in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as said before (1). But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that is in things is convertible with being as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is convertible with being, as the manifestation with the manifested; for this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as has been said already (1). It may, however, be said that being also is in the things and in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; although <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is primarily in things; and this is so because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and being differ in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Not-being has nothing in itself whereby it can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; yet it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> renders it knowable. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is based on being, inasmuch as not-being is a kind of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> being, apprehended, that is, by reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> When it is said that being cannot be apprehended except under the notion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, this can be understood in two ways. In the one way so as to mean that being is not apprehended, unless the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> follows apprehension of being; and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In the other way, so as to mean that being cannot be apprehended unless the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> be apprehended also; and this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cannot be apprehended unless the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being be apprehended also; since being is included in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The case is the same if we compare the intelligible object with being. For being cannot be understood, unless being is intelligible. Yet being can be understood while its intelligibility is not understood. Similarly, being when understood is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is not understood by understanding being.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether good is logically prior to the true?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For what is more universal is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior, as is evident from Phys. i. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is more universal than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, namely, of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in things, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing as said above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). But that which is in things is prior to that which is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as is clear from Ethic. iv. But <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is included under <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; since, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arbit. ii, 19), it is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is prior to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> What is in more things is prior <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is in some things wherein <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is not, as, for instance, in mathematics. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is prior to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are convertible with being, as to suppositum, yet they differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>. And in this manner the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, speaking absolutely, is prior to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as appears from two reasons.

<p>First, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is more closely related to being than is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> regards being itself simply and immediately; while the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> follows being in so far as being is in some way perfect; for thus it is desirable.

<p>Secondly, it is evident from the fact that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Hence, since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> regards <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> must be prior in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The will and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> mutually include one another: for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to understand. So then, among things directed to the object of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, are comprised also those that belong to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and conversely. Whence in the order of things desirable, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> stands as the universal, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as the particular; whereas in the order of intelligible things the converse of the case. From the fact, then, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is prior in the order of things desirable; but not that it is prior absolutely.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A thing is prior <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> in so far as it is prior to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends primarily being itself; secondly, it apprehends that it understands being; and thirdly, it apprehends that it desires being. Hence the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being is first, that of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> second, and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> third, though <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is called "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in general, but a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> according to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shows himself in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a> and word as he really is. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as applied to "life" is used in a particular sense, inasmuch as a man fulfills in his life that to which he is ordained by the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as it has been said that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in other things (1). Whereas the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of "<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" is found in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as he fulfills his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to his neighbor, as ordained by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence we cannot argue from these particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in general.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether God is truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> composing and dividing. But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not composition and division. Therefore in Him there is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Vera Relig. xxxvi) is a "likeness to the principle." But in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no likeness to a principle. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever is said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is said of Him as of the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things; thus the being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all being; and His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. If therefore there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be from Him. But it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that someone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore this will be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> says, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As said above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is found in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> according as it apprehends a thing as it is; and in things according as they have being conformable to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. This is to the greatest degree found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For His being is not only conformed to His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but it is the very act of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and His act of understanding is the measure and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every other being and of every other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and He Himself is His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and act of understanding. Whence it follows not only that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in Him, but that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, and the sovereign and first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Although in the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is neither composition nor division, yet in His simple act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> He judges of all things and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things complex; and thus there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is according to its conformity with its principle, that is to say, to the things from which it receives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> also of things is according to their conformity with their principle, namely, the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now this cannot be said, properly speaking, of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; unless perhaps in so far as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is appropriated to the Son, Who has a principle. But if we speak of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, we cannot understand this unless the affirmative must be resolved into the negative, as when one says: "the Father is of Himself, because He is not from another." Similarly, the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be called a "likeness to the principle," inasmuch as His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is not dissimilar to His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not-being and privation have no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of themselves, but only in the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now all apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the statement--"that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> commits fornication is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>"--is entirely from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to argue, "Therefore that this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> fornicates is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", is a fallacy of Accident.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether there is only one truth, according to which all things are true?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that there is only one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to which all things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Trin. xv, 1), "nothing is greater than the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; otherwise the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> would be the judge of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: whereas in fact it judges all things according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not according to its own measure. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore there is no other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> says (De Verit. xiv), that, "as is the relation of time to temporal things, so is that of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things." But there is only one time for all temporal things. Therefore there is only one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by which all things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> it is written (<a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse2">Psalm 11:2</a>), "Truths are decayed from among the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In one sense <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereby all things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is one, and in another sense it is not. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which we must consider that when anything is predicated of many things univocally, it is found in each of them according to its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; as animal is found in each <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of animal. But when anything is predicated of many things <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogically</a>, it is found in only one of them according to its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and from this one the rest are denominated. So healthiness is predicated of animal, of urine, and of medicine, not that health is only in the animal; but from the health of the animal, medicine is called healthy, in so far as it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of health, and urine is called healthy, in so far as it indicates health. And although health is neither in medicine nor in urine, yet in either there is something whereby the one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, and the other indicates health. Now we have said (1) that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> resides primarily in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and secondarily in things, according as they are related to the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. If therefore we speak of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to its proper <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then are there many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> in many <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>; and even in one and the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to the number of things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Whence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse2">Psalm 11:2</a>, "Truths are decayed from among the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>," says: "As from one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> face many likenesses are reflected in a mirror, so many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are reflected from the one divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." But if we speak of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as it is in things, then all things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by one primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; to which each one is assimilated according to its own entity. And thus, although the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> or forms of things are many, yet the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is one, in conformity to which all things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not judge of things according to any kind of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but according to the primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as it is reflected in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in a mirror, by reason of the first principles of the understanding. It follows, therefore, that the primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And yet, even <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which resides in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not simply, but in a certain degree, in so far as it is its perfection; even as science may be said to be greater than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that nothing subsisting is greater than the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> is correct in so far as things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by their relation to the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether created truth is eternal?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib.

But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of these is a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is always, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But universals are always and everywhere; therefore they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. So therefore is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is the most universal.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the present was to be in the future. But as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a proposition regarding the present is a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so is that of a proposition regarding the future. Therefore some <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, all that is without beginning and end is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of enunciables is without beginning and end; for if their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had a beginning, since it was not before, it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was not, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, of course, by reason of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was before it began to be. Similarly, if it be asserted that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has an end, it follows that it is after it has ceased to be, for it will still be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, as laid down before (10, 3).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of enunciations is no other than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For an enunciation resides in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and in speech. Now according as it is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> it has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of itself: but according as it is in speech, it is called enunciable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according as it signifies some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, not on account of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> residing in the enunciation, as though in a subject. Thus urine is called healthy, not from any health within it but from the health of an animal which it indicates. In like manner it has been already said that things are called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence, if no <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> were <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Now because only the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in it alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Nor does it follow from this that anything else but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, as shown already (5).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a circle, and the fact that two and three make five, have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> That something is always and everywhere, can be understood in two ways. In one way, as having in itself the power of extension to all time and to all places, as it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be everywhere and always. In the other way as not having in itself determination to any place or time, as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is said to be one, not because it has one form, but by the absence of all distinguishing form. In this manner all universals are said to be everywhere and always, in so far as universals are independent of place and time. It does not, however, follow from this that they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, except in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, if one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> that is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> That which now is, was future, before it (actually) was; because it was in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that it would be. Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> were removed, that thing's coming to be was not future. But the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is alone <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Hence it does not follow that it was always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that what now is would be, except in so far as its future being was in the sempiternal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Because our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, neither is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of enunciable propositions which are formed by us, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but it had a beginning in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now before such <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, it was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that such a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, except by reason of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherein alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> now to say that that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did not then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>: and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is now in our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and not by reason of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the things. For this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning not-being; and not-being has not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of itself, but only so far as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> apprehends it. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, in so far as we apprehend its not-being as preceding its being.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether truth is immutable?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is immutable. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Lib. Arbit. ii, 12), that "Truth and mind do not rank as equals, otherwise <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would be mutable, as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, what remains after every change is immutable; as primary <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is unbegotten and incorruptible, since it remains after all generation and corruption. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains after all change; for after every change it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that a thing is, or is not. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is immutable.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of an enunciation changes, it changes mostly with the changing of the thing. But it does not thus change. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">Anselm</a> (De Verit. viii), "is a certain rightness" in so far as a thing answers to that which is in the divine mind concerning it. But this proposition that "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits", receives from the divine mind the signification that <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> does sit; and it has the same signification even though he does not sit. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the proposition in no way changes.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, where there is the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, there is the same effect. But the same thing is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the three propositions, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits, will sit, sat." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of each is the same. But one or other of these must be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of these propositions remains immutable; and for the same reason that of any other.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse2">Psalm 11:2</a>),"Truths are decayed from among the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Truth, properly speaking, resides only in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as said before (1); but things are called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> residing in an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence the mutability of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be regarded from the point of view of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which consists in its conformity to the thing understood. Now this conformity may vary in two ways, even as any other likeness, through change in one of the two extremes. Hence in one way <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> varies on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, from the fact that a change of opinion occurs about a thing which in itself has not changed, and in another way, when the thing is changed, but not the opinion; and in either way there can be a change from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. If, then, there is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> wherein there can be no alternation of opinions, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which nothing can escape, in this is immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now such is the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as is clear from what has been said before (14, 15). Hence the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is immutable. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is mutable; not because it is itself the subject of change, but in so far as our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> changes from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>, for thus forms may be called mutable. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is that according to which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things are said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and this is altogether immutable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is speaking of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and being are convertible terms. Hence just as being is not generated nor corrupted of itself, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, in so far as this being or that is corrupted or generated, as is said in Phys. i, so does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> change, not so as that no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains, but because that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not remain which was before.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A proposition not only has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as other things are said to have it, in so far, that is, as they correspond to that which is the design of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> concerning them; but it said to have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a special way, in so far as it indicates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which consists in the conformity of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with a thing. When this disappears, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of an opinion changes, and consequently the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the proposition. So therefore this proposition, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as long as he is sitting, both with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the thing, in so far as the expression is significative, and with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of signification, in so far as it signifies a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion. When <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> rises, the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains, but the second is changed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The sitting of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the proposition, "<a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits," has not the same meaning when <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> sits, after he sits, and before he sits. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which results, varies, and is variously signified by these propositions concerning present, past, or future. Thus it does not follow, though one of the three propositions is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains invariable.
