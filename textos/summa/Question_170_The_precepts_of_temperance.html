<h1>Question 170. The precepts of temperance</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3170.htm#article1"> The precepts of temperance itself</a> <li><a href="../summa/3170.htm#article2"> The precepts of its parts</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the precepts of temperance are suitably given in the Divine law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> are unsuitably given in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (123, 12; 141, 8; I-II, 66, 4). Now there is no precept of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, which are the most important among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>. Therefore it was unfitting to include among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is contrary to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as stated above (154, 1,8).

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> is not only about venereal matters, but also about pleasures of meat and drink. Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> include no prohibition of a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> pertaining to pleasures of meat and drink, or to any other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Neither, therefore, should they include a precept prohibiting <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which pertains to venereal pleasure.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the lawgiver's <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> inducement to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> precedes the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are forbidden in order that obstacles to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be removed. Now the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are the most important in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Therefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> should have included an affirmative precept directly prescribing the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, rather than a negative precept forbidding <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> which is directly opposed thereto.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse14">Exodus 20:14-17</a>).

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>), "the end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>," which is enjoined upon us in the two precepts concerning the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contains those precepts which tend more directly to the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbor. Now among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> would seem most of all opposed to the love of our neighbor, since thereby a man lays hold of another's property for his own use, by abusing his neighbor's wife. Wherefore the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> include a special prohibition of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, not only as committed in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, but also as desired in thought.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Among the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> there is not one that is so directly opposed to the love of our neighbor as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that is opposed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. And yet the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of daring, which is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, is wont to be sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which is forbidden by one of the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>: for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir008.htm#verse18">Sirach 8:18</a>): "Go not on the way with a bold <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lest he burden thee with his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Gluttony is not directly opposed to the love of our neighbor, as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is. Nor indeed is any other <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for a father is not so wronged by the seduction of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> over whom he has no connubial right, as is the husband by the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of his wife, for he, not the wife herself, has power over her body [<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 7:4</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above (122, 1,4) the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> are universal principles of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; hence they need to be common precepts. Now it was not possible to give any common affirmative precepts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, because the practice of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> varies according to different times, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> remarks (De Bono Conjug. xv, 7), and according to different <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laws and customs.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the precepts of the virtues annexed to temperance are suitably given in the Divine law?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> are unsuitably given in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. For the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, as stated above (1, ad 3), are certain universal principles of the whole <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," according to <a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse15">Sirach 10:15</a>. Therefore among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> there should have been one forbidding <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a place before all should have been given in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> to those precepts by which men are especially induced to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, because these would seem to be the most important. Now since <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> subjects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would seem most of all to dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; wherefore obedience is accounted one of the degrees of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, as stated above (Question 161, Article 6); and the same apparently applies to meekness, the effect of which is that a man does not contradict the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> observes (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 7). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> should have contained precepts of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and meekness.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it was stated in the foregoing Article that <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>, because it is contrary to the love of our neighbor. But inordinateness of outward movements, which is contrary to modesty, is opposed to neighborly love: wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says in his Rule (Ep. ccxii): "In all your movements let nothing be done to offend the eye of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whatever." Therefore it seems that this kind of inordinateness should also have been forbidden by a precept of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> suffices the authority of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> annexed to <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> may be considered in two ways: first, in themselves; secondly, in their effects. Considered in themselves they have no direct connection with the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of our neighbor; rather do they regard a certain moderation of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself. But considered in their effects, they may regard the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of our neighbor: and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a> contains precepts that relate to the prohibition of the effects of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to the parts of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Thus the effect of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, which is opposed to meekness, is sometimes that a man goes on to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> (and this is forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>), and sometimes that he refuses due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to his parents, which may also be the result of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which leads many to transgress the precepts of the first table.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Pride is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it lies hidden in the heart; and its inordinateness is not perceived by all in common. Hence there was no place for its prohibition among the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, which are like first self-evident principles.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Those precepts which are <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> an inducement to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> presuppose the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> to be already given, wherefore they cannot be first precepts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> so as to have a place in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Inordinate outward movement is not injurious to one's neighbor, if we consider the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the act, as are <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, which are forbidden in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">decalogue</a>; but only as being signs of an inward inordinateness, as stated above (168, 1, ad 1,3).
