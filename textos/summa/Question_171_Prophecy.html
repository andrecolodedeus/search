<h1>Question 171. Prophecy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article1"> Does prophecy pertain to knowledge?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article2"> Is it a habit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article3"> Is it only about future contingencies?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article4"> Does a prophet know all possible matters of prophecy?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article5"> Does a prophet distinguish that which he perceives by the gift of God, from that which he perceives by his own spirit?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3171.htm#article6"> Can anything false be the matter of prophecy?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prophecy pertains to knowledge?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/sir048.htm#verse14">Sirach 48:14</a>) that after death the body of Eliseus <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>, and further on (<a href="../bible/sir049.htm#verse18">Sirach 49:18</a>) it is said of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> that "his bones were visited, and after death they <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>." Now no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> remains in the body or in the bones after death. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>): "He that prophesieth, speaketh to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto edification." Now speech is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself, but its effect. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every cognitive perfection excludes folly and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Yet both of these are consistent with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse7">Hosea 9:7</a>): "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> ye, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was foolish and mad [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>']." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not a cognitive perfection.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so inspiration regards, apparently, the affections, since it denotes a kind of motion. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is described as "inspiration" or "<a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> [Prolog. super Psalt. i]. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> more than to the affections.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse9">1 Samuel 9:9</a>): "For he that is now called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> past was called a seer." Now sight pertains to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Prophecy first and chiefly consists in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because, to wit, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things that are far [procul] removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore they may be said to take their name from <em>phanos</em>, "apparition," because things appear to them from afar. Wherefore, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> states (Etym. vii, 8), "in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, they were called Seers, because they saw what others saw not, and surveyed things hidden in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>." Hence among heathen nations they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as "vates, on account of their power of mind [vi mentis]," [The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'vates' is from the Greek <em>phates</em>, and may be rendered 'soothsayer'] (Etym. viii, 7).

<p>Since, however, it is written (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>): "The manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit," and further on (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>): "Seek to abound unto the edification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," it follows that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> consists secondarily in speech, in so far as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declare for the instruction of others, the things they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through being taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/isa021.htm#verse10">Isaiah 21:10</a>, "That which I have heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, I have declared unto you." Accordingly, as <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. viii, 7), "<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>" may be described as "proefatores [foretellers], because they tell from afar [porro fantur]," that is, speak from a distance, "and foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about things to come."

<p>Now those things above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ken which are <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which they surpass as regards the operation of the Divine power, according to <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse20">Mark 16:20</a>, "They . . . preached everywhere, the Lord working withal and confirming the word with signs that followed." Hence, thirdly, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is concerned with the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as a kind of confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> utterances. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 34:10-11</a>): "There arose no more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> like unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whom the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> face to face, in all the signs and wonders."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> These passages speak of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in reference to the third point just mentioned, which regards the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> utterances.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who are described as foolish and mad are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of whom it is said (<a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 3:16</a>): "Hearken not to the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that prophesy to you, and deceive you; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord," and (<a href="../bible/eze013.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 13:3</a>): "Woe to the foolish <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that follow their own spirit, and see nothing."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> It is requisite to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be raised to the perception of Divine things: wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/eze002.htm#verse1">Ezekiel 2:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee." This raising of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is brought about by the motion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, wherefore the text goes on to say: "And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> entered into me . . . and He set me upon my feet." After the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> has been raised to heavenly things, it perceives the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence the text continues: "And I heard Him speaking to me." Accordingly inspiration is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as regards the raising of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to <a href="../bible/job032.htm#verse8">Job 32:8</a>, "The inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding": while <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as regards the very perception of Divine things, whereby <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is completed; by its means the veil of darkness and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is removed, according to <a href="../bible/job012.htm#verse22">Job 12:22</a>, "He discovereth great things out of darkness."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prophecy is a habit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. For according to Ethic. ii, 5, "there are three things in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, power, passion, and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not a power, for then it would be in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, since the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are common to them. Again it is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> faculty, as stated above (I-II, 22, 2); whereas <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> pertains principally to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated in the foregoing Article. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, every perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is not always in act, is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and it is not always in act, else a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> could not be described as asleep. Therefore seemingly <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is reckoned among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is something in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, as stated above (I-II, 110, 2). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is something "whereby we act when we will," as the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Commentator</a> [<a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> or Ibn Roshd, 1120-1198] says (De Anima iii). But a man cannot make use of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> when he will, as appears in the case of Eliseus (<a href="../bible/2ki003.htm#verse15">2 Kings 3:15</a>), "who on Josaphat inquiring of him concerning the future, and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> failing him, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a minstrel to be brought to him, that the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> might come down upon him through the praise of psalmody, and fill his mind with things to come," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> observes (Hom. i super Ezech.). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse13">Ephesians 5:13</a>), "all that is made manifest is light," because, to wit, just as the manifestation of the material sight takes place through material light, so too the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sight takes place through <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light. Accordingly manifestation must be proportionate to the light by means of which it takes place, even as an effect is proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Since then <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> pertains to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that surpasses <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), it follows that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> requires an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light surpassing the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Hence the saying of <a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse8">Micah 7:8</a>: "When I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light." Now light may be in a subject in two ways: first, by way of an abiding form, as material light is in the sun, and in fire; secondly, by way of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, or passing impression, as light is in the air. Now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light is not in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by way of an abiding form, else a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> would always be able to prophesy, which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "Sometimes the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is lacking to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, nor is it always within the call of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet so that in its absence he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that its presence is due to a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>." Hence Eliseus said of the Sunamite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse27">2 Kings 4:27</a>): "Her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me." The reason for this is that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light that is in a subject by way of an abiding and complete form, perfects the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> chiefly to the effect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the principle of the things manifested by that light; thus by the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> chiefly the first principles of all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>. Now the principle of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which are manifested by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, Whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> do not see in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, although He is seen by the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in whom this light is by way of an abiding and complete form, according to <a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>, "In Thy light we shall see light."

<p>It follows therefore that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light is in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by way of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> or transitory impression. This is indicated <a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse22">Exodus 33:22</a>: "When my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock," etc., and <a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse11">1 Kings 19:11</a>: "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord; and behold the Lord passeth," etc. Hence it is that even as the air is ever in need of a fresh enlightening, so too the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is always in need of a fresh <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; thus a disciple who has not yet acquired the principles of an art needs to have every detail explained to him. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse4">Isaiah 1:4</a>): "In the morning He wakeneth my ear, so that I may hear Him as a master." This is also indicated by the very manner in which <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a> are uttered: thus it is stated that "the Lord spake to such and such a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>," or that "the word of the Lord," or "the hand of the Lord was made upon him."

<p>But a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> is an abiding form. Wherefore it is evident that, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This division of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher's</a> does not comprise absolutely all that is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only such as can be principles of moral actions, which are done sometimes from passion, sometimes from <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, sometimes from mere power, as in the case of those who perform an action from the judgment of their reason before having the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of that action.

<p>However, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> may be reduced to a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, provided we understand passion to denote any kind of receiving, in which sense the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 4) that "to understand is, in a way, to be passive." For just as, in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the possible <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is passive to the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so too in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is passive to the enlightening of the Divine light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as in corporeal things, when a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> ceases, there remains a certain aptitude to a repetition of the passion--thus wood once ignited is more easily ignited again, so too in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, after the actual enlightenment has ceased, there remains an aptitude to be enlightened anew--thus when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> has once been aroused to devotion, it is more easily recalled to its former devotion. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De orando Deum. Ep. cxxx, 9) that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> need to be frequent, "lest devotion be extinguished as soon as it is kindled."

<p>We might, however, reply that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, even while his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> enlightenment ceases to be actual, on account of his being deputed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, "And I made thee a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Every <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> raises <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to something above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this may happen in two ways. First, as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act--for instance, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the uncertain and hidden things of Divine wisdom--and for such acts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not granted a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Secondly, a thing is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to the mode but not the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the act--for instance to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him in the mirror of His creatures--and for this a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is bestowed.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether prophecy is only about future contingencies?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is only about future contingencies. For <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> says [Prol. super Psalt. i] that "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a Divine inspiration or <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, announcing the issue of things with unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now issues pertain to future contingencies. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is about future contingencies alone.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is differentiated from wisdom and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which are about Divine things; and from the discernment of spirits, which is about <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> spirits; and from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things. Now <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and acts are differentiated by their objects, as stated above (I-II, 54, 2). Therefore it seems that the object of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not connected with any of the above. Therefore it follows that it is about future contingencies alone.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, difference of object <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> difference of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (I-II, 54, 2). Therefore, if one <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is about future contingencies, and another about other things, it would seem to follow that these are different <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i super Ezech.) that some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a> are "about the future, for instance (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah 7:14</a>), 'Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son'"; some are "about the past, as (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis 1:1</a>), 'In the beginning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth'"; some are "about the present," as (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</a>), "If all prophesy, and there come in one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not . . . the secrets of his heart are made manifest." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not about future contingencies alone.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A manifestation made by means of a certain light can extend to all those things that are subject to that light: thus the body's sight extends to all colors, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> extends to whatever is subject to the light of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> comes through a Divine light, whereby it is possible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things both Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, both <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and corporeal; and consequently the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> extends to them all. Thus by the ministry of spirits a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> concerning the perfections of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was made to <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where it is written, "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated." Moreover his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> contains matters referring to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> bodies, according to the words of <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse12">Isaiah 40:12</a>, "Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand," etc. It also contains matters relating to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct, according to <a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse1">Isaiah 58:1</a>, "Deal thy bread to the hungry," etc.; and besides this it contains things pertaining to future events, according to <a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse9">Isaiah 47:9</a>, "Two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, barrenness and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>."

<p>Since, however, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is about things remote from our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it must be observed that the more remote things are from our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the more pertinent they are to prophecy. Of such things there are three degrees. One degree comprises things remote from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, either sensitive or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a>, of some particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; thus a particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by sense things present to him locally, which another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, since they are removed from him. Thus Eliseus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> what his disciple Giezi had done in his absence (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse26">2 Kings 5:26</a>), and in like manner the secret thoughts of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are manifested <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> to another, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>; and again in this way what one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by demonstration may be revealed to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>.

<p>The second degree comprises those things which surpass the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> without exception, not that they are in themselves unknowable, but on account of a defect in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; such as the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, which was revealed by the <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy," etc. (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a>).

<p>The last degree comprises things remote from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, through being in themselves unknowable; such are future contingencies, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which is indeterminate. And since that which is predicated universally and by its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, takes precedence of that which is predicated in a limited and relative sense, it follows that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of future events belongs most properly to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and from this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> apparently takes its name. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "And since a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is so called because he foretells the future, his name loses its significance when he speaks of the past or present."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Prophecy is there defined according to its proper signification; and it is in this sense that it is differentiated from the other gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This is evident from what has just been said. We might also reply that all those things that are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> have the common aspect of being unknowable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> except by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; whereas those that are the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of "wisdom," "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," and the "interpretation of speeches," can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but are manifested in a higher way through the enlightening of the Divine light. As to "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," although it is about things invisible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is not concerned with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but with a man's <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of assent to things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by others.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The formal element in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the Divine light, which being one, gives unity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, although the things <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> manifested by the Divine light are diverse.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether by the Divine revelation a prophet knows all that can be known prophetically?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that by the Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse7">Amos 3:7</a>): "The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now whatever is revealed <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> is something done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore there is not one of them but what is revealed to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> works are perfect" (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a "Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>," as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore it is perfect; and this would not be so unless all possible matters of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> were revealed <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, since "the perfect is that which lacks nothing" (Phys. iii, 6). Therefore all possible matters of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are revealed to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the Divine light which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more powerful than the right of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> science. Now a man who has acquired a science <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whatever pertains to that science; thus a grammarian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all matters of grammar. Therefore it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all matters of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i super Ezech.) that "sometimes the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> indicates the present to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind and nowise the future; and sometimes it points not to the present but to the future." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all matters of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Things which differ from one another need not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> simultaneously, save by reason of some one thing in which they are connected and on which they depend: thus it has been stated above (I-II, 65, 1 and 2) that all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> must needs <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> simultaneously on account of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Now all the things that are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through some principle are connected in that principle and depend thereon. Hence he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a principle perfectly, as regards all to which its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> extends, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> at the same time all that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through that principle; whereas if the common principle is unknown, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only in a general way, it does not follow that one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all those things at the same time, but each of them has to be manifested by itself, so that consequently some of them may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and some not.

<p>Now the principle of those things that are <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> manifested by the Divine light is the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> do not see in itself. Wherefore there is no need for their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all possible matters of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; but each one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> some of them according to the special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of this or that <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The Lord reveals to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> all things that are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the instruction of the faithful; yet not all to every one, but some to one, and some to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Prophecy is by way of being something imperfect in the genus of Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>: hence it is written (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>) that "prophecies shall be made void," and that "we prophesy in part," i.e. imperfectly. The Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> will be brought to its perfection in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; wherefore the same text continues (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>): "When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away." Consequently it does not follow that nothing is lacking to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, but that it lacks none of those things to which <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is directed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who has a science <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the principles of that science, whence whatever is pertinent to that science depends; wherefore to have the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a science perfectly, is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whatever is pertinent to that science. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the principle of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Himself through <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; wherefore the comparison fails.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the prophet always distinguishes what he says by his own spirit from what he says by the prophetic spirit?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> always distinguishes what he says by his own spirit from what he says by the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> spirit. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Confess. vi, 13) that his mother said "she could, through a certain feeling, which in words she could not express, discern betwixt Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a>, and the dreams of her own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> always distinguishes what he says by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, from what he says by his own spirit.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands nothing impossible, as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> [Pelagius, Ep. xvi, among the supposititious works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>] says. Now the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were commanded (<a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse28">Jeremiah 23:28</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> can distinguish what he has through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from what he sees otherwise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> resulting from a Divine light is greater than that which results from the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now he that has science, by the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> for certain that he has it. Therefore he that has <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by a Divine light is much more <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he has it.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "It must be observed that sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when consulted, utter certain things by their own spirit, through being much accustomed to prophesying, and think they are speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> spirit."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is instructed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in two ways: in one way by an express <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, in another way by a most mysterious instinct to "which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is subjected without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 17). Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has the greatest <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> about those things which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by an express <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and he has it for certain that they are revealed to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/jer026.htm#verse15">Jeremiah 26:15</a>): "In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the Lord sent me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing." Else, were he not certain about this, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which relies on the utterances of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> would not be certain. A sign of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> may be gathered from the fact that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> being admonished in a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision, prepared to sacrifice his only-begotten son, which he nowise would have done had he not been most certain of the Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<p>On the other hand, his position with regard to the things he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by instinct is sometimes such that he is unable to distinguish fully whether his thoughts are conceived of Divine instinct or of his own spirit. And those things which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by Divine instinct are not all manifested with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a>, for this instinct is something imperfect in the genus of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. It is thus that we are to understand the saying of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>. Lest, however, this should lead to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, "they are very soon set aright by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> [For instance, cf. <a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#verse3">2 Samuel 7:3 seqq.</a>], and from Him they hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that they reproach themselves for having said what was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>," as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> adds (Hom. i super Ezech.).

<p>The arguments set down in the first place consider the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> that is made by the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> spirit; wherefore the answer to all the objections is clear.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether things known or declared prophetically can be false?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or declared <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is about future contingencies, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Now future contingencies may possibly not happen; else they would happen of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, Isaias <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> saying (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse1">Isaiah 38:1</a>): "Take order with thy house, for thou shalt surely die, and shalt not live," and yet fifteen years were added to his life (<a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse6">2 Kings 20:6</a>). Again the Lord said (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>): "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I also will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have thought to do them." This is instanced in the example of the Ninevites, according to <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse10">John 3:10</a>: "The Lord [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'] had mercy with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which He had said that He would do to them, and He did it not." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in a conditional proposition, whenever the antecedent is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the consequent is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, because the consequent of a conditional proposition stands in the same relation to the antecedent, as the conclusion to the premises in a syllogism, and a syllogism whose premises are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> always leads to a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusion, as we find <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in I Poster. 6. But if the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, the following conditional proposition must needs be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: "If a thing has been <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>, it will be." Now the antecedent of this conditional proposition is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, since it is about the past. Therefore the consequent is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> absolutely; yet this is unfitting, for then <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> would not be about contingencies. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> says [Prol. in Psalt. i] that "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a Divine inspiration or <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, announcing the issue of things with invariable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> would not be invariable, if its <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> could be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Therefore nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As may be gathered from what has been said (1 and 3 and 5), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> impressed under the form of teaching on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the same in disciple and teacher since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the disciple is a likeness of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the teacher, even as in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things the form of the thing generated is a likeness of the form of the generator. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> speaks in this sense when he says [Comment. in <a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse10">Daniel 2:10</a> that "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is the seal of the Divine foreknowledge." Consequently the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must needs be in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and utterances, as in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, under which nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can possibly come, as stated in I, 16, 8. Therefore nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> can come under <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated in I, 14, 13 the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of the Divine foreknowledge does not exclude the contingency of future singular events, because that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regards the future as present and already determinate to one thing. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also, which is an "impressed likeness" or "seal of the Divine foreknowledge," does not by its unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> exclude the contingency of future things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Divine foreknowledge regards future things in two ways. First, as they are in themselves, in so far, to wit, as it sees them in their presentiality: secondly, as in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, inasmuch as it sees the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> in relation to their effects. And though future contingencies, considered as in themselves, are determinate to one thing, yet, considered as in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, they are not so determined but that they can happen otherwise. Again, though this twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is always united in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it is not always united in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, because an imprint made by an active <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not always on a par with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Hence sometimes the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge, in so far as the latter regards future contingencies in themselves: and such things happen in the same way as foretold, for example this saying of <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah 7:14</a>: "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive." Sometimes, however, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the order of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to effects; and then at times the event is otherwise than foretold. Yet the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not cover a falsehood, for the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is that inferior <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, whether they be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, are so disposed as to lead to such a result. On this way we are to understand the saying of <a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse1">Isaiah 38:1</a>: "Thou shalt die, and not live"; in other words, "The disposition of thy body has a tendency to death": and the saying of <a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse4">Jonah 3:4</a>, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed," that is to say, "Its <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> demand that it should be destroyed." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said "to repent," metaphorically, inasmuch as He bears Himself after the manner of one who repents, by "changing His sentence, although He changes not His counsel" [Cf. I, 19, 7, ad 2].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is the same as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Divine foreknowledge, as stated above, the conditional proposition: "If this was <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>, it will be," is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the same way as the proposition: "If this was foreknown, it will be": for in both cases it is impossible for the antecedent not to be. Hence the consequent is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, considered, not as something future in our regard, but as being present to the Divine foreknowledge, as stated in I, 14, 13, ad 2.
