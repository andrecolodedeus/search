<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prophecy can be natural?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 26) that "sometimes the mere strength of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sufficiently cunning to foresee certain things": and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13) that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according as it is withdrawn from the sense of the body, is able to foresee the future [Cf. I, 86, 4, ad 2]. Now this pertains to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can acquire <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more alert while one wakes than while one sleeps. Now some, during sleep, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> foresee the future, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> asserts (De Somn. et Vigil. [De Divinat. per Somn. ii, which is annexed to the work quoted]). Much more therefore can a man <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> foreknow the future.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is more perfect than dumb animals. Yet some dumb animals have foreknowledge of future things that concern them. Thus ants foreknow the coming rains, which is evident from their gathering grain into their nest before the rain commences; and in like manner fish foreknow a coming storm, as may be gathered from their movements in avoiding places exposed to storm. Much more therefore can men foreknow the future that concerns themselves, and of such things is <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse18">Proverbs 29:18</a>): "When <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad"; wherefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the stability of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Now "<a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not fail in necessaries" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, de Anima iii, 9. Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse21">2 Peter 1:21</a>): "For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> came not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at any time, but the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> comes not from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but through the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (171, 6, ad 2) <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> foreknowledge may regard future things in two ways: in one way, as they are in themselves; in another way, as they are in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Now, to foreknow future things, as they are in themselves, is proper to the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to Whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> all things are present, as stated in I, 14, 13. Wherefore such like foreknowledge of the future cannot come from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but from Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> alone. On the other hand, future things can be foreknown in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> with a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: thus a physician foreknows future health or death in certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, through previous experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the order of those <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> to such effects. Such like <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future may be understood to be in a man by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in two ways. On one way that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from that which it holds, is able to foreknow the future, and thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13): "Some have deemed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to contain a certain power of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>." This seems to be in accord with the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> [Phaed. xxvii; Civit. vi], who held that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things by participating in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; but that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is obscured in them by union with the body; yet in some more, in others less, according to a difference in bodily purity. According to this it might be said that men, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are not much obscured through union with the body, are able to foreknow such like future things by their own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Against this opinion <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13): "How is it that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot always have this power of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, since it always wishes to have it?"

<p>Since, however, it seems truer, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from sensibles, as stated in I, 84, 6, it is better to have recourse to another explanation, and to hold that men have no such foreknowledge of the future, but that they can acquire it by means of experience, wherein they are helped by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition, which depends on the perfection of a man's imaginative power, and the clarity of his understanding.

<p>Nevertheless this latter foreknowledge of the future differs in two ways from the former, which comes through Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. First, because the former can be about any events whatever, and this infallibly; whereas the latter foreknowledge, which can be had <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, is about certain effects, to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience may extend. Secondly, because the former <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is "according to the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" [171, 3, Objection 1], while the latter is not, and can cover a falsehood. Now the former foreknowledge, and not the latter, properly belongs to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, because, as stated above (Question 171, Article 3), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is of things which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Consequently we must say that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> strictly so called cannot be from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but only from Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is withdrawn from corporeal things, it becomes more adapted to receive the influence of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> [Cf. I, 88, 4, ad 2], and also is more inclined to receive the subtle motions which take place in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> through the impression of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, whereas it is hindered from receiving them while occupied with sensible things. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. iv, 26) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, at the approach of death, foresees certain future things, by reason of the subtlety of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," inasmuch as it is receptive even of slight impressions. Or again, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> future things by a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but not by its own power, because according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13), "if this were so, it would be able to foreknow the future whenever it willed," which is clearly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> of the future by means of dreams, comes either from the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, or from a corporeal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (Question 95, Article 6), when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>. Now both these <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> are more applicable to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> while asleep than while awake, because, while awake, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is occupied with external sensibles, so that it is less receptive of the subtle impressions either of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a>, or even of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; although as regards the perfection of judgment, the reason is more alert in waking than in sleeping.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Even dumb animals have no foreknowledge of future events, except as these are foreknown in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, whereby their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is moved more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, especially in waking, is more disposed according to reason than according to the impression of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>. Yet reason effects much more amply in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that which the impression of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> effects in dumb animals; and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> by inspiring the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> assists <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> still more.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light extends even to the direction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>; and in this way <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is requisite for the government of a people, especially in relation to Divine worship; since for this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not sufficient, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether prophetic revelation comes through the angels?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> does not come through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse27">Wisdom 7:27</a>) that Divine wisdom "conveyeth herself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," and "maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now wisdom makes the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately. Therefore it also makes the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> immediately, and not through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is reckoned among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. But the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>, "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is not made by means of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> [Prol. in Psalt. i] says that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a "Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>": whereas if it were conveyed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it would be called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not bestowed by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. iv): "Our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fathers received Divine <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> by means of the heavenly powers"; and he is speaking there of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> visions. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is conveyed by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a>), "Things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are well ordered [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Those that are, are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.']." Now the Divine ordering, according to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> [Coel. Hier. iv; Eccl. Hier. v], is such that the lowest things are directed by middle things. Now the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> hold a middle position between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, in that they have a greater share in the perfection of the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than men have. Wherefore the Divine enlightenments and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> are conveyed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is bestowed by Divine enlightenment and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Therefore it is evident that it is conveyed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> which makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can form an impression; whereas <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a perfection of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> also can form an impression, as stated in I, 111, 1, wherefore the comparison fails between the two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as their first principle: yet He works <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this kind in men by means of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The work of the instrument is ascribed to the principal agent by whose power the instrument acts. And since a minister is like an instrument, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, which is conveyed by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, is said to be Divine.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether a natural disposition is requisite for prophecy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is received by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> according to the disposition of the recipient, since a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/amo001.htm#verse2">Amos 1:2</a>, "The Lord will roar from Sion," says: "Anyone who wishes to make a comparison <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> turns to those things of which he has experience, and among which his life is spent. For example, sailors compare their enemies to the winds, and their losses to a shipwreck. On like manner Amos, who was a shepherd, likens the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to that which is inspired by the lion's roar." Now that which is received by a thing according to the mode of the recipient requires a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> requires a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the considerations of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are more lofty than those of acquired science. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition hinders the considerations of acquired science, since many are prevented by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition from succeeding to grasp the speculations of science. Much more therefore is a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition requisite for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition is a much greater obstacle than an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> impediment. Now the considerations of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are hindered by an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> occurrence. For <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says in his commentary on Matthew [The quotation is from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. vi in Num.] that "at the time of the marriage act, the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> will not be vouchsafed, even though it be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that fulfils the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of procreation." Much more therefore does a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition hinder <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and thus it would seem that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (xxx in Ev.): "He," namely the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, "fills the boy harpist and makes him a Psalmist; He fills the herdsman plucking wild figs, and makes him a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> requires no previous disposition, but depends on the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> alone of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of Whom it is written (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>): "All these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as He will."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and exact sense comes from Divine inspiration; while that which comes from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not called <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> except in a relative sense. Now we must observe that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the universal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> requires neither previous <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> nor previous disposition of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in His corporeal effects, for He is able at the same instant to bring into being <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and disposition and form, so neither does He require a previous disposition in His <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effects, but is able to produce both the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> effect and at the same time the fitting disposition as requisite according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. More than this, He is able at the same time, by creation, to produce the subject, so as to dispose a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and give it the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, at the very instant of its creation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It matters not to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by what comparisons the thing <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> is expressed; and so the Divine operation makes no change in a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in this respect. Yet if there be anything in him incompatible with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, it is removed by the Divine power.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The considerations of science proceed from a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot work without a previous disposition in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. This cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition, if not removed, might be an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, for instance if a man were altogether deprived of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> senses. On the same way a man might be hindered from the act of prophesying by some very strong passion, whether of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> as in coition, or by any other passion. But such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> indisposition as this is removed by the Divine power, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a good life is requisite for prophecy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For it is written (<a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse27">Wisdom 7:27</a>) that the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "through nations conveyeth herself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>," and "maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now there can be no <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> without a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life and <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be without a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life and <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, secrets are not revealed save to a friend, according to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John 15:15</a>, "But I have called you friends, because all things whatsoever I have heard of My Father, I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveals His secrets to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (<a href="../bible/amo003.htm#verse7">Amos 3:7</a>). Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which is impossible without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore seemingly <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is impossible without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew 7:15</a>): "Beware of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves." Now all who are without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are likened inwardly to a ravening wolf, and consequently all such are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> except he be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Somn. et Vigil. [Cf. De Divinat. per Somn. i, which is annexed to the work quoted]) that "if interpretation of dreams is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is unfitting for it to be bestowed on any but the best." Now it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is vouchsafed only to the best men.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> To those who had said, "Lord, have we not <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> in Thy name?" this reply is made: "I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22-23</a>). Now "the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> who are His" (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be in those who are not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life may be considered from two points of view. First, with regard to its inward root, which is <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Secondly, with regard to the inward <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the outward actions. Now <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is given chiefly in order that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 18): "A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not transferred from the left side to the right, unless he receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by Whom he is made a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of his neighbor." Hence whatever can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, and consequently without <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of life. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and this is clear on two counts. First, on account of their respective acts: for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whose act precedes the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which power is perfected by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>) reckons <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> with other things pertinent to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, that can be had without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Secondly, on account of their respective ends. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> like other gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> is given for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>, "The manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit"; and is not directly intended to unite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> affections to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the purpose of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be without a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, as regards the first root of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p>If, however, we consider a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and external actions, from this point of view an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life is an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> requires the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be raised very high in order to contemplate <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> things, and this is hindered by strong <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and the inordinate pursuit of external things. Hence we read of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse38">2 Kings 4:38</a>) that they "dwelt together with [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'before']" Eliseus, leading a solitary life, as it were, lest worldly employment should be a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is given to a man both for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, and in order to enlighten his own mind; and such are those whom Divine wisdom, "conveying itself" by <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> to their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, "maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Others, however, receive the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> merely for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22</a>, says: "Sometimes prophesying, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the casting out of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are accorded not to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of those who do these things, but either to the invoking the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or to the condemnation of those who invoke, and for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of those who see and hear."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Hom. xxvii in Ev.] expounding this passage [<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John 15:15</a> says: "Since we love the lofty things of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as soon as we hear them, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them as soon as we love them, for to love is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Accordingly He had made all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, because having renounced earthly desires they were kindled by the torches of perfect love." On this way the Divine secrets are not always revealed to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Not all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men are ravening wolves, but only those whose purpose is to injure others. For <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Opus Imperf. in Matth., Hom. xix, among the works of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to him] that "<a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, though they be sinners, are called slaves of the flesh, but never ravening wolves, because they do not purpose the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." And since <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others, it is manifest that such are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, because they are not sent for this purpose by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> are not always bestowed on those who are simply the best, but sometimes are vouchsafed to those who are best as regards the receiving of this or that <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grants the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to those whom He judges best to give it to.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether any prophecy comes from the demons?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> comes from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is "a Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>," according to <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> [Prol. in Psalt. i]. But that which is done by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is not Divine. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can be from a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, some kind of enlightenment is requisite for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated above (171, 2,3). Now the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not enlighten the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above in I, 119, 3. Therefore no <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> can come from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a sign is worthless if it betokens contraries. Now <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a sign in confirmation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; wherefore a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse6">Romans 12:6</a>, "Either <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to be used according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," says: "Observe that in reckoning the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, he begins with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which is the first <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the reasonableness of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; since believers, after receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be bestowed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse19">1 Kings 18:19</a>): "Gather unto me all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> unto <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">mount Carmel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> four hundred and fifty, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the grove four hundred, who eat at <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel's</a> table." Now these were worshippers of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore it would seem that there is also a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 171, Article 1), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> denotes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> far removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now it is evident that an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a higher order can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some things that are far removed from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an inferior <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Again, above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is not only the Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, even by their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certain things remote from men's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which they can reveal to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: although those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> are remote simply and most of all.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, properly and simply, is conveyed by Divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> alone; yet the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> which is made by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> may be called <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in a restricted sense. Wherefore those men to whom something is revealed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are styled in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, not simply, but with an addition, for instance as "<a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>," or "<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 19): "When the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit lays hold of a man for such purposes as these," namely visions, "he makes him either devilish, or possessed, or a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> is here defining <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in its proper and simple acceptation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> reveal what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not by enlightening the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but by an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, or even by audible speech; and in this way this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> differs from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> can be distinguished from Divine <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by certain, and even outward, signs. Hence <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Opus Imperf. in Matth., Hom. xix, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>] that "some prophesy by the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, such as diviners, but they may be discerned by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> sometimes utters what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> never." Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse21">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>): "If in silent thought thou answer: How shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the word that the Lord hath spoken? Thou shalt have this sign: Whatsoever that same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretelleth in the name of the Lord, and it come not to pass, that thing the Lord hath not spoken."

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the prophets of the demons ever foretell the truth?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> never foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> [<a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary</a> the Deacon (Ambrosiaster) on <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> says that "Every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by whomsoever spoken, is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not speak from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, because "there is no concord between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and Belial ['What concord hath <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?']" (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>). Therefore it would seem that they never foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are inspired by the spirit of untruth, according to <a href="../bible/1ki022.htm#verse22">1 Kings 22:22</a>, "I will go forth, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> never speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as stated above (Question 111, Article 6). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> never speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is said of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John 8:44</a>) that "when he speaketh a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaketh of his own, for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a liar, and the father thereof," i.e. of lying. Now by inspiring his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> speaks only of his own, for he is not appointed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> minister to declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since "light hath no fellowship with darkness [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'What fellowship hath light with darkness?']" (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> never foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/num022.htm#verse14">Numbers 22:14</a>, says that "Balaam was a diviner, for he sometimes foreknew the future by help of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the magic art." Now he foretold many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things, for instance that which is to be found in <a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse17">Numbers 24:17</a>: "A star shall rise out of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and a scepter shall spring up from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>." Therefore even the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is in relation to things, so is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now in things it is impossible to find one that is wholly devoid of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore it is also impossible for any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be wholly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, without some mixture of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says [Comment. in Luc. xvii, 12; Cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, QQ. Evang. ii, 40 that "no teaching is so <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that it never mingles <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with falsehood." Hence the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, with which they instruct their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, contains some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> whereby it is rendered acceptable. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is led astray to falsehood by the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the semblance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> says [Opus Imperf. in Matth., Hom. xix, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>]: "The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is allowed sometimes to speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things, in order that his unwonted truthfulness may gain credit for his lie."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not always speak from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, but sometimes by Divine inspiration. This was evidently the case with Balaam, of whom we read that the Lord spoke to him (<a href="../bible/num022.htm#verse12">Numbers 22:12</a>), though he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use even of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> for the profit of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence He foretells certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> even by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, both that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be rendered more credible, since even its foes bear witness to it, and also in order that men, by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> such men, may be more easily led on to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore also the Sibyls foretold many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Yet even when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are instructed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, they foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, sometimes by virtue of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the author of which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and sometimes by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> spirits, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> declares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 19): so that even then this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> proclaim is from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is always inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in Whom there is no falsehood, wherefore He never says what is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; whereas a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not always instructed by the spirit of untruth, but sometimes even by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Even the very spirit of untruth sometimes declares <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things, sometimes <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Those things are called the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' own, which they have of themselves, namely lies and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; while they have, not of themselves but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those things which belong to them by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: and it is by virtue of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that they sometimes foretell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as stated above (ad 1). Moreover <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use of them to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is to be accomplished through them, by revealing Divine mysteries to them through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as already stated (Gen. ad lit. xii, 19; I, 109, 4, ad 1).
