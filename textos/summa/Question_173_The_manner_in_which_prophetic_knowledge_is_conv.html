<h1>Question 173. The manner in which prophetic knowledge is conveyed</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3173.htm#article1"> Do the prophets see God's very essence?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3173.htm#article2"> Is the prophetic revelation effected by the infusion of certain species, or by the infusion of Divine light alone?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3173.htm#article3"> Is prophetic revelation always accompanied by abstraction from the sense?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3173.htm#article4"> Is prophecy always accompanied by knowledge of the things prophesied?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the prophets see the very essence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> see the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse1">Isaiah 38:1</a>, "Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die and not live," says: "Prophets can read in the book of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge in which all things are written." Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge is His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 7) that "in that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from which all temporal things are made, we see with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind's</a> eye the type both of our being and of our actions." Now, of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have the highest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things. Therefore they, especially, see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, future contingencies are foreknown by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> "with unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." Now future contingencies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> thus in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is not made void in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; whereas "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is made void" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not conveyed by a vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Prophecy denotes Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> afar off. Wherefore it is said of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse13">Hebrews 11:13</a>) that "they were beholding . . . afar off." But those who are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in the state of bliss see, not as from afar off, but rather, as it were, from near at hand, according to <a href="../bible/psa139.htm#verse14">Psalm 139:14</a>, "The upright shall dwell with Thy countenance." Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> differs from the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which we shall have in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, so that it is distinguished therefrom as the imperfect from the perfect, and when the latter comes the former is made void, as appears from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>).

<p>Some, however, wishing to discriminate between <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed, have maintained that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> see the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (which they call the "mirror of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>") [Cf. De Veritate, xii, 6; Sent. II, D, XI, part 2, art. 2, ad 4, not, however, in the way in which it is the object of the blessed, but as containing the types [Cf. I, 15] of future events. But this is altogether impossible. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of bliss in His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, according to the saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Confess. v, 4): "Happy whoso <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> Thee, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not these," i.e. creatures. Now it is not possible to see the types of creatures in the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without seeing It, both because the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is Itself the type of all things that are made--the ideal type adding nothing to the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> save only a relationship to the creature--and because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a thing in itself--and such is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the object of heavenly bliss--precedes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that thing in its relation to something else--and such is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as containing the types of things. Consequently it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as containing the types of creatures, and yet not as the object of bliss. Therefore we must conclude that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is not the vision of the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> do not see in the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> Itself the things they do see, but that they see them in certain images, according as they are enlightened by the Divine light.

<p>Wherefore <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> (Coel. Hier. iv), in speaking of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> visions, says that "the wise theologian calls that vision divine which is effected by images of things lacking a bodily form through the seer being <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> in divine things." And these images illumined by the Divine light have more of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a mirror than the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: since in a mirror images are formed from other things, and this cannot be said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind thus enlightened may be called a mirror, in so far as a likeness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine foreknowledge is formed therein, for which reason it is called the "mirror of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>," as representing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> sees all things as present before Him, as stated above (Question 172, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are said to read the book of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is reflected from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is said to see in the First Truth the type of his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in so far as the image of the First Truth shines forth on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind, so that he is able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> From the very fact that future contingencies are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to unalterable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can impress a like <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind without the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether, in prophetic revelation, new species of things are impressed on the prophet's mind, or merely a new light?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> no new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things are impressed on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind, but only a new light. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> on <a href="../bible/amo001.htm#verse2">Amos 1:2</a> says that "<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> draw comparisons from things with which they are conversant." But if <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision were effected by means of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> newly impressed, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s previous experience of things would be inoperative. Therefore no new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are impressed on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), "it is not imaginative but <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> vision that makes the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>"; wherefore it is declared (<a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse1">Daniel 10:1</a>) that "there is need of understanding in a vision." Now <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> vision, as stated in the same book (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6) is not effected by means of images, but by the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is not effected by impressing <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> endows <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with something that surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculties form all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things. Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> no new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things are impressed, but merely an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse10">Hosea 12:10</a>): "I have multiplied" their "<a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a>, and I have used similitudes, by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> results, not from a diversity of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, which is common to every <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision, but from a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, whence similitudes also result. Therefore it seems that in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> new <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of things are impressed, and not merely an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> pertains most of all to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>." Now two things have to be considered in connection with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, namely the acceptance or representation of things, and the judgment of the things represented. Now things are represented to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind under the form of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>: and according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they must be represented first to the senses, secondly to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, thirdly to the passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and these are changed by the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> derived from the phantasms, which change results from the enlightening action of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> there are the forms of sensible things not only as received from the senses, but also transformed in various ways, either on account of some bodily transformation (as in the case of people who are asleep or out of their senses), or through the coordination of the phantasms, at the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, for the purpose of understanding something. For just as the various arrangements of the letters of the alphabet convey various <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> to the understanding, so the various coordinations of the phantasms produce various intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p>As to the judgment formed by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind, it depends on the power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light.

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> confers on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind something which surpasses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> faculty in both these respects, namely as to the judgment which depends on the inflow of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, and as to the acceptance or representation of things, which is effected by means of certain <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Human</a> teaching may be likened to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> in the second of these respects, but not in the first. For a man represents certain things to his disciple by signs of speech, but he cannot enlighten him inwardly as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does.

<p>But it is the first of these two that holds the chief place in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, since judgment is the complement of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Wherefore if certain things are divinely represented to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> likenesses, as happened to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse1">Genesis 41:1-7</a>) and to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> (<a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse1">Daniel 4:1-2</a>), or even by bodily likenesses, as happened to Balthasar (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm#verse5">Daniel 5:5</a>), such a man is not to be considered a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, unless his mind be enlightened for the purpose of judgment; and such an apparition is something imperfect in the genus of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Wherefore some [Rabbi Moyses, Doct. Perplex. II, xxxvi] have called this "<a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>," and such is <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by dreams. And yet a man will be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, if his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> be enlightened merely for the purpose of judging of things seen in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> by others, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> who interpreted <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> dream. But, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), "especially is he a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who excels in both respects, so," to wit, "as to see in spirit likenesses significant of things corporeal, and understand them by the quickness of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>."

<p>Now sensible forms are divinely presented to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind, sometimes externally by means of the senses--thus <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> saw the writing on the wall (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm#verse25">Daniel 5:25</a>)--sometimes by means of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> forms, either of exclusively Divine origin and not received through the senses (for instance, if images of colors were imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of one blind from birth), or divinely coordinated from those derived from the senses--thus <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> saw the "boiling caldron . . . from the face of the north" (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 1:13</a>)--or by the direct impression of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as in the case of those who receive infused scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or wisdom, such as Solomon or the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light is divinely imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind--sometimes for the purpose of judging of things seen by others, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, quoted above, and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whose understanding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> opened "that they might understand the scriptures" (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse45">Luke 24:45</a>); and to this pertains the "interpretation of speeches"--sometimes for the purpose of judging according to Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of the things which a man apprehends in the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>--sometimes for the purpose of discerning truthfully and efficaciously what is to be done, according to <a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse14">Isaiah 63:14</a>, "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> was their leader."

<p>Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is conveyed sometimes by the mere infusion of light, sometimes by imprinting <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> anew, or by a new coordination of <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above, sometimes in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> previously derived from the senses are divinely coordinated so as to accord with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be revealed, and then previous experience is operative in the production of the images, but not when they are impressed on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> wholly from without.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellectual</a> vision is not effected by means of bodily and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> images, but by an intelligible image. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. ix, 11) that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possesses a certain likeness of the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to it." Sometimes this intelligible image is, in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, imprinted immediately by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sometimes it results from pictures in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, by the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light, since a deeper <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is gathered from these pictures in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> by means of the enlightenment of the higher light.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers to form all kinds of pictures in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, by simply considering these pictures, but not so that they be directed to the representation of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that surpass his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, since for this purpose he needs the assistance of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the prophetic vision is always accompanied by abstraction from the senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is always accompanied by abstraction from the senses. For it is written (<a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers 12:6</a>): "If there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream." Now a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says at the beginning of the Psalter, "a vision that takes place by dreams and apparitions consists of things which seem to be said or done." But when things seem to be said or done, which are neither said nor done, there is abstraction from the senses. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is always accompanied by abstraction from the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, when one power is very intent on its own operation, other powers are drawn away from theirs; thus men who are very intent on hearing something fail to see what takes place before them. Now in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is very much uplifted, and intent on its act. Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is always accompanied by abstraction from the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the same thing cannot, at the same time, tend in opposite directions. Now in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> tends to the acceptance of things from above, and consequently it cannot at the same time tend to sensible objects. Therefore it would seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to be always accompanied by abstraction from the senses.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 14:32</a>): "The spirits of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are subject to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Now this were impossible if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> were not in possession of his faculties, but abstracted from his senses. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is not accompanied by abstraction from the senses.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated in the foregoing Article, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> takes place in four ways: namely, by the infusion of an intelligible light, by the infusion of intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, by impression or coordination of pictures in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and by the outward presentation of sensible images. Now it is evident that there is no abstraction from the senses, when something is presented to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind by means of sensible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>--whether these be divinely formed for this special purpose, as the bush shown to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse2">Exodus 3:2</a>), and the writing shown to <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm">Daniel 5</a>)--or whether they be produced by other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>; yet so that they are ordained by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> significant of something, as, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was signified by the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark of Noah</a>.

<p>Again, abstraction from the external senses is not rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is enlightened by an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, or impressed with intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, since in us the perfect judgment of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is effected by its turning to sensible objects, which are the first principles of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as stated in I, 84, 6.

<p>When, however, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is conveyed by images in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, abstraction from the senses is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> lest the things thus seen in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> be taken for objects of external sensation. Yet this abstraction from the senses is sometimes complete, so that a man perceives nothing with his senses; and sometimes it is incomplete, so that he perceives something with his senses, yet does not fully discern the things he perceives outwardly from those he sees in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 12): "Those images of bodies which are formed in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are seen just as bodily things themselves are seen by the body, so that we see with our eyes one who is present, and at the same time we see with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> one who is absent, as though we saw him with our eyes."

<p>Yet this abstraction from the senses takes place in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> without subverting the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as is the case with those who are possessed or out of their senses; but is due to some well-ordered <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> may be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>--for instance, sleep--or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>--for instance, the intenseness of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>' <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; thus we read of Peter (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse9">Acts 10:9</a>) that while he was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the supper-room [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'the house-top' or 'upper-chamber'] "he fell into an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>"--or he may be carried away by the Divine power, according to the saying of <a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 1:3</a>: "The hand of the Lord was upon him."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted refers to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in whom <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> pictures were formed or coordinated, either while asleep, which is denoted by the word "dream," or while awake, which is signified by the word "vision."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is intent, in its act, upon distant things which are far removed from the senses, the intensity of its application leads to abstraction from the senses; but when it is intent, in its act, upon the coordination of or judgment concerning objects of sense, there is no need for abstraction from the senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The movement of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> mind results not from its own power, but from a power acting on it from above. Hence there is no abstraction from the senses when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is led to judge or coordinate matters relating to objects of sense, but only when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is raised to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of certain more lofty things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The spirit of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is said to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as regards the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> utterances to which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> refers in the words quoted; because, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in declaring what they have seen speak their own mind, and are not thrown off their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> balance, like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are possessed, as Priscilla and Montanus maintained. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> itself, it would be more correct to say that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are subject to the. spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether prophets always know the things which they prophesy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which they prophesy. For, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), "those to whom signs were shown in spirit by means of the likenesses of bodily things, had not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was brought into action, so that those signs were also understood by them." Now what is understood cannot be unknown. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what he prophesies.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the light of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> surpasses the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now one who possesses a science by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> light, is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his scientific acquirements. Therefore he who utters things by the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light cannot ignore them.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is directed for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> enlightenment; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse19">2 Peter 1:19</a>): "We have the more firm prophetical word, whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place." Now nothing can enlighten others unless it be lightsome in itself. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is first enlightened so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he declares to others.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse51">John 11:51</a>): "And this he" (Caiphas) "spoke, not of himself, but being the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> of that year, he <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should die for the nation," etc. Now Caiphas <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this not. Therefore not every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he prophesies.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as an instrument that is deficient in regard to the principal agent. Now the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is moved not only to apprehend something, but also to speak or to do something; sometimes indeed to all these three together, sometimes to two, sometimes to one only, and in each case there may be a defect in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is moved to think or apprehend a thing, sometimes he is led merely to apprehend that thing, and sometimes he is further led to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a> to him.

<p>Again, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is moved to speak something, so that he understands what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> means by the words he utters; like David who said (<a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse2">2 Samuel 23:2</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> hath spoken by me"; while, on the other hand, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose mind is moved to utter certain words <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> means by them, as was the case with Caiphas (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse51">John 11:51</a>).

<p>Again, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> moves a man's mind to do something, sometimes the latter understands the meaning of it, like <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> who hid his loin-cloth in the Euphrates (<a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>); while sometimes he does not understand it--thus the soldiers, who divided <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> garments, understood not the meaning of what they did.

<p>Accordingly, when a man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he is being moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to think something, or signify something by word or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, this belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; whereas when he is moved, without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, this is not perfect <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> instinct. Nevertheless it must be observed that since the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is a defective instrument, as stated above, even <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not all that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> means by the things they see, or speak, or even do.

<p>And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections, since the arguments given at the beginning refer to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whose minds are perfectly enlightened from above.
