<h1>Question 174. The division of prophecy</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article1"> The division of prophecy into its species</a> <li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article2"> Is the more excellent prophecy that which is without imaginative vision?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article3"> The various degrees of prophecy</a> <li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article4"> Was Moses the greatest of the prophets?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article5"> Can a comprehensor be a prophet?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3174.htm#article6"> Did prophecy advance in perfection as time went on?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether prophecy is fittingly divided into the prophecy of divine predestination, of foreknowledge, and of denunciation?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is unfittingly divided according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew 1:23</a>, "Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child," where it is stated that "one kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> proceeds from the Divine <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and must in all respects be accomplished so that its fulfillment is independent of our will, for instance the one in question. Another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge: and into this our will enters. And another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is called <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, which is significative of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> disapproval." For that which results from every <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should not be reckoned a part of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now all <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is according to the Divine foreknowledge, since the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> "read in the book of foreknowledge," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse1">Isaiah 38:1</a>. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> according to foreknowledge should not be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as something is foretold in <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, so is something foretold in promise, and both of these are subject to alteration. For it is written (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse7">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>): "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy it. If that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I also will repent"--and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, and afterwards the text continues in reference to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of promise (<a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse9">Jeremiah 18:9-10</a>): "I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom, to build up and plant it. If it shall do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in My sight . . . I will repent of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that I have spoken to do unto it." Therefore as there is reckoned to be a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, so should there be a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of promise.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> says (Etym. vii, 8): "There are seven kinds of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. The first is an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, which is the transport of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: thus Peter saw a vessel descending from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with all manner of beasts therein. The second kind is a vision, as we read in Isaias, who says (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>): 'I saw the Lord sitting,' etc. The third kind is a dream: thus <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> in a dream, saw a ladder. The fourth kind is from the midst of a cloud: thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spake to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. The fifth kind is a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as that which called to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saying (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse11">Genesis 22:11</a>): 'Lay not thy hand upon the boy.' The sixth kind is taking up a parable, as in the example of Balaam (<a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse15">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse15">24:15</a>). The seventh kind is the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as in the case of nearly all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Further, he mentions three kinds of vision; "one by the eyes of the body, another by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, a third by the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>." Now these are not included in the aforesaid division. Therefore it is insufficient.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> stands the authority of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> above quoted is ascribed.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of moral <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> and acts are distinguished according to their objects. Now the object of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and surpassing the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore, according to the difference of such things, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is divided into various <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as assigned above. Now it has been stated above (71, 6, ad 2) that the future is contained in the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in two ways. First, as in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: and thus we have the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of "<a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>," which is not always fulfilled. but it foretells the relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to effect, which is sometimes hindered by some other occurrence supervening. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknows certain things in themselves--either as to be accomplished by Himself, and of such things is the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>," since, according to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide Orth. ii, 30), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> predestines things which are not in our power"--or as to be accomplished through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and of such is the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of "foreknowledge." This may regard either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, since the latter regards <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> alone. And since <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is comprised under foreknowledge, the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> in the beginning of the Psalter assigns only two <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, namely of "foreknowledge," and of "<a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Foreknowledge, properly speaking, denotes precognition of future events in themselves, and in this sense it is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. But in so far as it is used in connection with future events, whether as in themselves, or as in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, it is common to every <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of promise is included in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, because the aspect of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the same in both. But it is denominated in preference from <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denunciation</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is more inclined to remit punishment than to withdraw promised blessings.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a> divides <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> according to the manner of prophesying. Now we may distinguish the manner of prophesying--either according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> cognitive powers, which are sense, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and then we have the three kinds of vision mentioned both by him and by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7)--or according to the different ways in which the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> current is received. Thus as regards the enlightening of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there is the "fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" which he mentions in the seventh place. As to the imprinting of pictures on the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> he mentions three, namely "dreams," to which he gives the third place; "vision," which occurs to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> while awake and regards any kind of ordinary object, and this he puts in the second place; and "<a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>," which results from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being uplifted to certain lofty things, and to this he assigns the first place. As regards sensible signs he reckons three kinds of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, because a sensible sign is--either a corporeal thing offered externally to the sight, such as "a cloud," which he mentions in the fourth place--or a "voice" sounding from without and conveyed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hearing--this he puts in the fifth place--or a voice proceeding from a man, conveying something under a similitude, and this pertains to the "parable" to which he assigns the sixth place.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the prophecy which is accompanied by intellective and imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by intellective vision alone?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> and imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> vision alone. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9): "He is less a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who sees in spirit nothing but the signs representative of things, by means of the images of things corporeal: he is more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who is merely endowed with the understanding of these signs; but most of all is he a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who excels in both ways," and this refers to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who has <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> together with imaginative vision. Therefore this kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more excellent.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the greater a thing's power is, the greater the distance to which it extends. Now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light pertains chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as stated above (Question 173, Article 2). Therefore apparently the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that extends to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is greater than that which is confined to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Prol. in Lib. Reg.) distinguishes the "<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>" from the "sacred writers." Now all those whom he calls <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (such as Isaias, <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, and the like) had <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> together with imaginative vision: but not those whom he calls sacred writers, as writing by the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (such as <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, David, Solomon, and the like). Therefore it would seem more proper to call <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> those who had <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> together with imaginative vision, than those who had <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> vision alone.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it is impossible for the Divine ray to shine on us, except as screened round about by the many-colored sacred veils." Now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is conveyed by the infusion of the divine ray. Therefore it seems that it cannot be without the veils of phantasms.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says at the beginning of the Psalter that "the most excellent manner of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is when a man prophesies by the mere inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, apart from any outward assistance of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>, word, vision, or dream."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The excellence of the means is measured chiefly by the end. Now the end of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is the manifestation of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore the more effective this manifestation is, the more excellent the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. But it is evident that the manifestation of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by means of the bare <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, is more effective than that which is conveyed under the similitude of corporeal things, for it approaches nearer to the heavenly vision whereby the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Hence it follows that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> whereby a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is seen by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, is more excellent than that in which a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is manifested by means of the similitudes of corporeal things in the vision of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p>Moreover the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is shown thereby to be more lofty: even as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> teaching the hearer, who is able to grasp the bare intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the master propounds, is shown to have a better understanding than one who needs to be taken by the hand and helped by means of examples taken from objects of sense. Hence it is said in commendation of David's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse3">2 Samuel 23:3</a>): "The strong one of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> spoke to me," and further on (<a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse4">2 Samuel 23:4</a>): "As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> When a particular <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has to be revealed by means of corporeal images, he that has both, namely the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light and the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, is more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> than he that has only one, because his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more perfect; and it is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> speaks as quoted above. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in which the bare intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed is greater than all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The same judgment does not apply to things that are sought for their own sake, as to things sought for the sake of something else. For in things sought for their own sake, the agent's power is the more effective according as it extends to more numerous and more remote objects; even so a physician is thought more of, if he is able to heal more people, and those who are further removed from health. on the other hand, in things sought only for the sake of something else, that agent would seem to have greater power, who is able to achieve his purpose with fewer means and those nearest to hand: thus more praise is awarded the physician who is able to heal a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by means of fewer and more gentle remedies. Now, in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is required, not for its own sake, but on account of the manifestation of the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is all the more excellent according as it needs it less.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The fact that a particular predicate is applicable to one thing and less properly to another, does not prevent this latter from being simply better than the former: thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the blessed is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the wayfarer, although <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is more properly predicated of the latter <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> implies an imperfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. On like manner <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> implies a certain obscurity, and remoteness from the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; wherefore the name of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is more properly applied to those who see by <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. And yet the more excellent <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is that which is conveyed by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, provided the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be revealed in either case. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light be divinely infused in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, not that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> things, but that he may be able to judge, with the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certitude</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, such <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is beneath that which is conveyed by an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision leading to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It was this kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that all those had who are included in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who moreover were called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> for the special reason that they exercised the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> calling officially. Hence they spoke as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> representatives, saying to the people: "Thus saith the Lord": but not so the authors of the "sacred writings," several of whom treated more frequently of things that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name, but in their own, yet with the assistance of the Divine light withal.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In the present life the enlightenment by the divine ray is not altogether without any veil of phantasms, because according to his present state of life it is unnatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> not to understand without a phantasm. Sometimes, however, it is sufficient to have phantasms abstracted in the usual way from the senses without any <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision divinely vouchsafed, and thus <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision is said to be without <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether the degrees of prophecy can be distinguished according to the imaginary vision?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> cannot be distinguished according to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. For the degrees of a thing bear relation to something that is on its own account, not on account of something else. Now, in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is sought on its own account, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision on account of something else, as stated above (2, ad 2). Therefore it would seem that the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are distinguished not according to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a>, but only according to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, vision.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, seemingly for one <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> there is one degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now one <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> receives <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> through various <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> visions. Therefore a difference of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> does not entail a difference of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> [<a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, super Prolog. Hieron. in Psalt.], <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> consists of words, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, dreams, and visions. Therefore the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should not be distinguished according to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, to which vision and dreams pertain, rather than according to words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The medium differentiates the degrees of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: thus science based on direct ["Propter quid"] <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> is more excellent than science based on indirect ["Quia"] premises or than opinion, because it comes through a more excellent medium. Now <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is a kind of medium in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should be distinguished according to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 173, Article 2), the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> wherein, by the intelligible light, a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed through an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, holds the mean between the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> wherein a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed without <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, and that wherein through the intelligible light and without an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or do things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct. Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more proper to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> than is action; wherefore the lowest degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is when a man, by an inward <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>, is moved to perform some outward action. Thus it is related of Samson (<a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#verse14">Judges 15:14</a>) that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came strongly upon him, and as the flax ['Lina.' <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> apparently read 'ligna' ('wood')] is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed." The second degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is when a man is enlightened by an inward light so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certain things, which, however, do not go beyond the bounds of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: thus it is related of Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#verse32">1 Kings 4:32-33</a>) that "he spoke . . . parables . . . and he treated about trees from the cedar that is in Libanus unto the hyssop that cometh out of the wall, and he discoursed of beasts and of fowls, and of creeping things and of fishes": and all of this came from divine inspiration, for it was stated previously (<a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#verse29">1 Kings 4:29</a>): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much."

<p>Nevertheless these two degrees are beneath <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> properly so called, because they do not attain to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is manifested through <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision is differentiated first according to the difference between dreams which occur during sleep, and vision which occurs while one is awake. The latter belongs to a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light that draws the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> away to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> things while it is awake and occupied with sensible things would seem to be stronger than that which finds a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> asleep and withdrawn from objects of sense. Secondly the degrees of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are differentiated according to the expressiveness of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> signs whereby the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is conveyed. And since words are the most expressive signs of intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it would seem to be a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, whether awake or asleep, hears words expressive of an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, than when he sees things significative of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for instance "the seven full ears of corn" signified "seven years of plenty" (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse22">Genesis 41:22-26</a>). On such like signs <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> would seem to be the more excellent, according as the signs are more expressive, for instance when <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> saw the burning of the city under the figure of a boiling cauldron (<a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 1:13</a>). Thirdly, it is evidently a still higher degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> when a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> not only sees signs of words or <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but also, either awake or asleep, sees someone speaking or showing something to him, since this proves the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind to have approached nearer to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Fourthly, the height of a degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> may be measured according to the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> seen: for it is a higher degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, if he who speaks or shows something to the waking or sleeping <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> be seen by him under the form of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, than if he be seen by him under the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and higher still is it, if he be seen by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> whether asleep or awake, under the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a>, "I saw the Lord sitting."

<p>But above all these degrees there is a third kind of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, wherein an intelligible and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is shown without any <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. However, this goes beyond the bounds of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> properly so called, as stated above (2, ad 3); and consequently the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are properly distinguished according to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> We are unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light, except by means of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> or sensible signs. Hence the difference in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> light is gathered from the difference in the things presented to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As stated above (Question 171, Article 2), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is by way, not of an abiding <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but of a transitory passion; wherefore there is nothing inconsistent if one and the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, at different times, receive various degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> mentioned there do not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, but to the announcement, which is made according to the disposition of those to whom that which is revealed to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is announced; and this is done sometimes by words, sometimes by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Now this announcement, and the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, are something consequent upon <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as stated above (Question 171, Article 1).

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Moses was the greatest of the prophets?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> at the beginning of the Psalter says that "David is called the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> by way of excellence." Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not the greatest of all.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, who made the sun and moon to stand still (<a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse12">Joshua 10:12-14</a>), and by Isaias, who made the sun to turn back (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse8">Isaiah 38:8</a>), than by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who divided the Red Sea (<a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse21">Exodus 14:21</a>). On like manner greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by Elias, of whom it is written (<a href="../bible/sir048.htm#verse4">Sirach 48:4-5</a>): "Who can <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> like to thee? Who raisedst up a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from below." Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew 11:11</a>) that "there hath not risen, among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, a greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not greater than all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>): "There arose no more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> like unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Although in some respect one or other of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was greater than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was simply the greatest of all. For, as stated above (3; 171, 1), in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> we may consider not only the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whether by <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or by <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, but also the announcement and the confirmation by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was greater than the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. First, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, since he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> did, according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27). Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse8">Numbers 12:8</a>) that he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "plainly and not by riddles." Secondly, as regards the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, which he had at his call, as it were, for not only did he hear words, but also saw one speaking to him under the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this not only while asleep, but even when he was awake. Hence it is written (<a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse11">Exodus 33:11</a>) that "the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend." Thirdly, as regards the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he wrought on a whole nation of unbelievers. Wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 34:10-11</a>): "There arose no more a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> like unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whom the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> face to face: in all the signs and wonders, which He sent by him, to do in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and to all his servants, and to his whole land."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of David approaches near to the vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision, because both received a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of intelligible and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without any <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. Yet the vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was more excellent as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Godhead; while David more fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and expressed the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> incarnation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> These signs of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> mentioned were greater as to the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the thing done; yet the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were greater as regards the way in which they were done, since they were wrought on a whole people.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> John belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, whose ministers take precedence even of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, since they are spectators of a fuller <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, as stated in <a href="../bible/2co003.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether there is a degree of prophecy in the blessed?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is a degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in the blessed. For, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and yet he is called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Therefore in like manner the blessed can be called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is a "<a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>." Now divine <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> are made even to the blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Therefore even blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a comprehensor from the moment of His conception; and yet He calls Himself a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse57">Matthew 13:57</a>), when He says: "A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, save in his own country." Therefore even comprehensors and the blessed can be called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it is written of Samuel (<a href="../bible/sir046.htm#verse23">Sirach 46:23</a>): "He lifted up his voice from the earth in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to blot out the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the nation." Therefore other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can likewise be called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> after they have died.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> word is compared (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse19">2 Peter 1:19</a>) to a "light that shineth in a dark place." Now there is no darkness in the blessed. Therefore they cannot be called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Prophecy denotes vision of some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as being far remote from us. This happens in two ways. First, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself, because, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in itself, but in some of its effects; and this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be more remote if it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of images of corporeal things, than if it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in its intelligible effects; and such most of all is the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> vision, which is conveyed by images and likenesses of corporeal things. Secondly, vision is remote on the part of the seer, because, to wit, he has not yet attained completely to his ultimate perfection, according to <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6</a>, "While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord."

<p>Now in neither of these ways are the blessed remote; wherefore they cannot be called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was interrupted after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>, and was not permanent like the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, wherefore he was as yet a seer from afar. For this reason his vision did not entirely lose the character of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a> is made to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not as being far distant, but as already wholly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore their <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> has not the character of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was at the same time comprehensor and wayfarer [Cf. III, 9, seqq.]. Consequently the notion of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not applicable to Him as a comprehensor, but only as a wayfarer.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Samuel had not yet attained to the state of blessedness. Wherefore although by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself of Samuel foretold to Saul the issue of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as revealed to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. It is not the same with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are now in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Nor does it make any difference that this is stated to have been brought about by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>' art, because although the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are unable to evoke the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, or to force it to do any particular thing, this can be done by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is consulted, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself declares the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by His messenger: even as He gave a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> answer by Elias to the King's messengers who were sent to consult the god of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki001.htm">2 Kings 1</a>).

<p>It might also be replied [The <a href="../bible/sir000.htm">Book of Ecclesiasticus</a> was not as yet declared by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be Canonical Scripture; Cf. I, 89, 8, ad 2] that it was not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Samuel, but a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> impersonating him; and that the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> calls him Samuel, and describes his prediction as <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a>, in accordance with the thoughts of Saul and the bystanders who were of this opinion.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the degrees of prophecy change as time goes on?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> change as time goes on. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>). Now according to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> (Hom. in Ezech.), "<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went on increasing as time went on." Therefore degrees of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should be distinguished according to the process of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is conveyed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declared both in words and in writing the things revealed to them. Now it is written (<a href="../bible/1sa003.htm#verse1">1 Samuel 3:1</a>) that before the time of Samuel "the word of the Lord was precious," i.e. rare; and yet afterwards it was delivered to many. On like manner the books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> do not appear to have been written before the time of Isaias, to whom it was said (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse1">Isaiah 8:1</a>): "Take thee a great book and write in it with a man's pen," after which many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> wrote their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a>. Therefore it would seem that in course of time the degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> made progress.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> said (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse13">Matthew 11:13</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> until John"; and afterwards the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in a much more excellent manner than in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of old, according to <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a>, "In other generations" the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it is now revealed to His holy <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>." Therefore it would seem that in course of time the degree of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> advanced.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and yet he preceded the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> did not advance in degree as time went on.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is directed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of which we are not only instructed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also guided in our actions, according to <a href="../bible/psa042.htm#verse3">Psalm 42:3</a>, "Send forth Thy light and Thy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: they have conducted me." Now our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists chiefly in two things: first, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>, "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is"; secondly, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> incarnation, according to <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John 14:1</a>, "You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Me." Accordingly, if we speak of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as directed to the Godhead as its end, it progressed according to three divisions of time, namely before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the other patriarchs were <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> taught things pertinent to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Godhead. Hence they are called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, according to <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#verse15">Psalm 104:15</a>, "Do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to My <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>," which words are said especially on behalf of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of things pertinent to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Godhead was made in a yet more excellent way than hitherto, because then not only certain special <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or families but the whole people had to be instructed in these matters. Hence the Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo006.htm#verse2">Exodus 6:2-3</a>): "I am the Lord that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, by the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> almighty, and My name Adonai I did not show to them"; because previously the patriarchs had been taught to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a general way in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one and Almighty, while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was more fully instructed in the simplicity of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, when it was said to him (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus 3:14</a>): "I am Who am"; and this name is signified by <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> in the word "Adonai" on account of their veneration for that unspeakable name. Afterwards in the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> was revealed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>: "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<p>In each state, however, the most excellent <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> was that which was given first. Now the first <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a>, was given to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, for it was at that time that men began to stray from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by turning aside to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, whereas hitherto no such <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> while all persevered in the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A less excellent <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> was made to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, being founded on that which was made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Wherefore it was said to him (<a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse24">Genesis 26:24</a>): "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy father," and in like manner to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse13">Genesis 28:13</a>): "I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy father, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>." Again in the state of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> the first <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> which was given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was more excellent, and on this <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> all the other <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelations</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were founded. And so, too, in the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the entire <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded on the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> vouchsafed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and three Persons, according to <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew 16:18</a>, "On this rock," i.e. of thy confession, "I will build My Church."

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> incarnation, it is evident that the nearer men were to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whether before or after Him, the more fully, for the most part, were they instructed on this point, and after Him more fully than before, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> declares (<a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a>).

<p>As regards the guidance of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> varied not according to the course of time, but according as circumstances required, because as it is written (<a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse18">Proverbs 29:18</a>), "When <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad." Wherefore at all times men were divinely instructed about what they were to do, according as it was expedient for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> is to be referred to the time before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> incarnation, as regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 27), "just as in the early days of the Assyrian kingdom promises were made most explicitly to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, so at the outset of the western Babylon," which is Rome, "and under its sway <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to come, in Whom were to be fulfilled the promises made through the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> oracles testifying in word and writing to that great event to come," the promises, namely, which were made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. "For while <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were scarcely ever lacking to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the time that they began to have kings, it was exclusively for their benefit, not for that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>. But when those <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> writings were being set up with greater publicity, which at some future time were to benefit the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, it was fitting to begin when this city," Rome to wit, "was being built, which was to govern the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>."

<p>The reason why it behooved that nation to have a number of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> especially at the time of the kings, was that then it was not over-ridden by other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, but had its own king; wherefore it behooved the people, as enjoying liberty, to have <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to teach them what to do.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who foretold the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> could not continue further than John, who with his finger pointed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> actually present. Nevertheless as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> says on this passage, "This does not mean that there were no more <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> after John. For we read in the <a href="../cathen/01117a.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> that Agabus and the four <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maidens</a>, daughters of Philip, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a>." John, too, wrote a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> book about the end of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and at all times there have not been lacking <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> having the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, not indeed for the declaration of any new doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but for the direction of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei v, 26) that "the emperor Theodosius sent to John who dwelt in the Egyptian desert, and whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by his ever-increasing fame to be endowed with the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> spirit: and from him he received a message assuring him of victory."
