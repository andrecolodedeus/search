<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether the soul of man is carried away to things divine?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not carried away to things divine. For some define <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> as "an uplifting by the power of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, from that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to that which is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" [Reference unknown; Cf. De Veritate xiii, 1. Now it is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that he be uplifted to things divine; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says at the beginning of his Confessions: "Thou madest us, Lord, for Thyself, and our heart is restless, till it rest in Thee." Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not carried away to things divine.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. viii) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is seen in this that He treats all things according to their mode and dignity." But it is not in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mode and worth that he be raised above what he is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not carried away to things divine.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> denotes <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of some kind. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rules us not by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or force, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says [De Fide Orth. ii, 30]. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not carried away to things divine.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> even to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." On which words a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says: "Rapt, that is to say, uplifted contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Rapture denotes <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of a kind as stated above (Objection 3); and "the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> is that which has its principle without, and in which he that suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> concurs not at all" (Ethic. iii, 1). Now everything concurs in that to which it tends in accordance with its proper inclination, whether <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>. Wherefore he who is carried away by some external agent, must be carried to something different from that to which his inclination tends. This difference arises in two ways: in one way from the end of the inclination--for instance a stone, which is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> inclined to be borne downwards, may be thrown upwards; in another way from the manner of tending--for instance a stone may be thrown downwards with greater velocity than consistent with its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> movement.

<p>Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is said to be carried away, in a twofold manner, to that which is contrary to its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: in one way, as regards the term of transport--as when it is carried away to punishment, according to <a href="../bible/psa049.htm#verse22">Psalm 49:22</a>, "Lest He snatch you away, and there be none to deliver you"; in another way, as regards the manner connatural to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is that he should understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through sensible things. Hence when he is withdrawn from the apprehension of sensibles, he is said to be carried away, even though he be uplifted to things whereunto he is directed <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>: provided this be not done intentionally, as when a man betakes himself to sleep which is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, wherefore sleep cannot be called <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, properly speaking.

<p>This withdrawal, whatever its term may be, may arise from a threefold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. First, from a bodily <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as happens to those who suffer abstraction from the senses through weakness: secondly, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as in those who are possessed: thirdly, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this last sense we are now speaking of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, whereby a man is uplifted by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to things <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and withdrawn from his senses, according to <a href="../bible/eze008.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 8:3</a>, "The spirit lifted me up between the earth and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and brought me in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> into Jerusalem."

<p>It must be observed, however, that sometimes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is said to be carried away, not only through being withdrawn from his senses, but also through being withdrawn from the things to which he was attending, as when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> mind wanders contrary to his purpose. But this is to use the expression in a less proper signification.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> It is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to tend to divine things through the apprehension of things sensible, according to <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a>, "The invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." But the mode, whereby a man is uplifted to divine things and withdrawn from his senses, is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> It belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mode and dignity that he be uplifted to divine things, from the very fact that he is made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image. And since a divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in order to attain that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he needs the divine assistance which is bestowed on him in every <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Hence it is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but above the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mind be thus uplifted in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The saying of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> refers to those things which a man does by himself. But as to those things which are beyond the scope of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> needs to be uplifted by a stronger operation, which in a certain respect may be called force if we consider the mode of operation, but not if we consider its term to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed both by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and by his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether rapture pertains to the cognitive rather than to the appetitive power?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> rather than to the cognitive power. For <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv): "The Divine love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>." Now love pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. Therefore so does <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> or rapture.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 3) that "he who fed the swine debased himself by a dissipated mind and an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> life; whereas Peter, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> delivered him and carried him into <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, was not beside himself, but above himself." Now the prodigal son sank into the depths by his <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore in those also who are carried up into the heights it is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> that is affected.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse1">Psalm 30:1</a>, "In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded," says in explaining the title [Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>]: "<em>Ekstasis</em> in Greek signifies in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> 'excessus mentis,' an aberration of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. This happens in two ways, either through dread of earthly things or through the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> in heavenly things and forgetful of this lower world." Now dread of earthly things pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in heavenly things, being placed in opposition to this dread, also pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa115.htm#verse2">Psalm 115:2</a>, "I said in my excess: Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a liar," says: "We speak of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, not when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> wanders through fear, but when it is carried aloft on the wings of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> or <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> does also.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can speak of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> in two ways. First, with regard to the term of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, and thus, properly speaking, <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> cannot pertain to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a>, but only to the cognitive power. For it was stated (1) that <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> is outside the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is rapt; whereas the movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is an inclination to an appetible <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Wherefore, properly speaking, in desiring something, a man is not rapt, but is moved by himself.

<p>Secondly, <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> may be considered with regard to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and thus it may have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power. For from the very fact that the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is strongly affected towards something, it may happen, owing to the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his affection, that a man is carried away from everything else. Moreover, it has an effect on the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, when for instance a man delights in the things to which he is rapt. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said that he was rapt, not only "to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"--which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>--but also into "paradise," which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Rapture adds something to <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> means simply a going out of oneself by being placed outside one's proper order [Cf. I-II, 28, 3]; while <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> denotes a certain <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in addition. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> may pertain to the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, as when a man's <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends to something outside him, and in this sense <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says that "the Divine love <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>," inasmuch as it makes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tend to the object loved. Hence he says afterwards that "even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, through the overflow of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, goes outside Himself in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for all beings." But even if this were said expressly of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, it would merely signify that love is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of rapture.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There is a twofold <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; to wit, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the sensuality. Now it is proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that his lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> be subject to the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and that the higher move the lower. Hence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may become outside himself as regards the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, in two ways. On one way, when a man's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> tends wholly to divine things, and takes no account of those things whereto the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> inclines him; thus <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. iv) that "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> through the vehemence of Divine love" exclaimed: "I live, now not I, but Christ liveth in me."

<p>In another way, when a man tends wholly to things pertaining to the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and takes no account of his higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. It is thus that "he who fed the swine debased himself"; and this latter kind of going out of oneself, or being beside oneself, is more akin than the former to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> because the higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is more proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Hence when through the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> a man is withdrawn from the movement of his higher <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, it is more a case of being withdrawn from that which is proper to him. Yet, because there is no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> therein, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is able to resist the passion, it falls short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, unless perchance the passion be so strong that it takes away entirely the use of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as happens to those who are mad with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or love.

<p>It must be observed. however, that both these excesses affecting the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an excess in the cognitive power, either because the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is carried away to certain intelligible objects, through being drawn away from objects of sense, or because it is caught up into some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision or fanciful apparition.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as love is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so fear is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore either of them may equally <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an aberration of mind; and all the more since fear arises from love, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9).

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether Paul, when in rapture, saw the essence of God?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, did not see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For just as we read of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> that he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, so we read of Peter (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse10">Acts 10:10</a>) that "there came upon him an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of mind." Now Peter, in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, saw not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> but an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. Therefore it would seem that neither did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is beatific. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, was not beatified; else he would never have returned to the unhappiness of this life, but his body would have been glorified by the overflow from his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as will happen to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and this clearly was not the case. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> saw not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 13:10-12</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are incompatible with the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when in this state had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope. Therefore he saw not the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7), "pictures of bodies are seen in the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision." Now <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is stated (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</a>) to have seen certain pictures in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, for instance of the "third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" and of "paradise." Therefore he would seem to have been <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision rather than to the vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. CXLVII, 13; ad Paulin., de videndo Deum) concludes that "possibly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> was seen by some while yet in this life: for instance by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> heard unspeakable words, which it is not granted unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to utter."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some have said that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, saw "not the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a certain reflection of His clarity." But <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> clearly comes to an opposite decision, not only in his book (De videndo Deum), but also in Gen. ad lit. xii, 28 (quoted in a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Ondeed the words themselves of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> indicate this. For he says that "he heard secret words, which it is not granted unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to utter": and such would seem to be words pertaining to the vision of the blessed, which transcends the state of the wayfarer, according to <a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse4">Isaiah 64:4</a>, "Eye hath not seen, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that love [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'wait for'] Thee" [<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>. Therefore it is more becoming to hold that he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man's</a> mind is <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in three ways. First, so that he contemplates it through certain <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> pictures, and such was the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> that came upon Peter. Secondly, so that he contemplates the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through its intelligible effects; such was the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of David, who said (<a href="../bible/psa115.htm#verse11">Psalm 115:11</a>): "I said in my excess: Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a liar." Thirdly, so that he contemplates it in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Such was the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as also of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> [Cf. 174, 4]; and not without reason, since as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was the first Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, so was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the first "Teacher of the gentiles" [Cf. I, 68, 4].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot be seen by a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> save through the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of which it is written (<a href="../bible/psa035.htm#verse10">Psalm 35:10</a>): "In Thy light we shall see light." But this light can be shared in two ways. First by way of an abiding form, and thus it beatifies the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Secondly, by way of a transitory passion, as stated above (171, 2) of the light of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; and in this way that light was in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he was in rapture. Hence this vision did not beatify him simply, so as to overflow into his body, but only in a restricted sense. Consequently this <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> pertains somewhat to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since, in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was beatified not as to the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but only as to the act of the blessed, it follows that he had not the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at the same time, although he had the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In one way by the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> we may understand something corporeal, and thus the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> denotes the empyrean [<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse7">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; Cf. I, 12, 11, ad 2, which is described as the "third," in relation to the aerial and starry heavens, or better still, in relation to the aqueous and crystalline heavens. Moreover <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is stated to be <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the "third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," not as though his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> consisted in the vision of something corporeal, but because this place is appointed for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the blessed. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a> says that the "third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> enjoy the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to this <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> he means that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> showed him the life wherein He is to be seen forevermore."

<p>In another way the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> may signify a supra-mundane vision. Such a vision may be called the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in three ways. First, according to the order of the cognitive powers. On this way the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> would indicate a supramundane bodily vision, conveyed through the senses; thus was seen the hand of one writing on the wall (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm#verse5">Daniel 5:5</a>); the second <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> would be an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision such as Isaias saw, and John in the Apocalypse; and the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> would denote an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> explanation (Gen. ad lit. xii, 26,28,34). Secondly, the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> may be taken according to the order of things knowable, the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> being "the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of heavenly bodies, the second the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of heavenly spirits, the third the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself." Thirdly, the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> may denote the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the degrees of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen. The first of these degrees belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the lowest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> [Cf. I, 108, 1], the second to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the middle <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the third to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>.

<p>And since the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> cannot be without delight, he says that he was not only "<a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" by reason of his <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, but also into "Paradise" by reason of the consequent delight.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether Paul, when in rapture, was withdrawn from his senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, was not withdrawn from his senses. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 28): "Why should we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that when so great an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, the teacher of the gentiles, was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to this most sublime vision, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was willing to vouchsafe him a glimpse of that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> which is to take the place of the present life?" Now in that future life after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will see the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> without being withdrawn from the senses of the body. Therefore neither did such a withdrawal take place in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a wayfarer, and also enjoyed an uninterrupted vision of the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, without, however, being withdrawn from His senses. Therefore there was no need for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be withdrawn from his senses in order for him to see the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, after seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> remembered what he had seen in that vision; hence he said (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>): "He heard secret words, which it is not granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to utter." Now the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> belongs to the sensitive faculty according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Mem. et Remin. i). Therefore it seems that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, while seeing the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not withdrawn from his senses.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27): "Unless a man in some way depart this life, whether by going altogether out of his body or by turning away and withdrawing from his carnal senses, so that he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> said, whether he be in the body or out of the body, he is not <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> and caught up into that vision.*" [The text of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> reads: "when he is rapt," etc.]

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through any cognitive power other than the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> does not turn to intelligible objects except by means of the phantasms [Cf. I, 84, 07] which it takes from the senses through the intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>; and it is in considering these phantasms that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> judges of and coordinates sensible objects. Hence in any operation that requires abstraction of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from phantasms, there must be also withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from the senses. Now in the state of the wayfarer it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, if it see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, to be withdrawn from phantasms. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> cannot be seen by means of a phantasm, nor indeed by any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> [Cf. I, 12, 2], since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> transcends not only all bodies, which are represented by phantasms, but also all intelligible creatures. Now when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is uplifted to the sublime vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that his mind's whole attention should be summoned to that purpose in such a way that he understand naught else by phantasms, and be absorbed entirely in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> while a wayfarer to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> without being withdrawn from his senses.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (3, Objection 2), after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, in the blessed who <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">see God in His essence</a>, there will be an overflow from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to the lower powers and even to the body. Hence it is in keeping with the rule itself of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">divine vision</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will turn towards phantasms and sensible objects. But there is no such overflow in those who are raptured, as stated (3, Objection 2, ad 2), and consequently the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was glorified by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whereby He saw the Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> much more fully than an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or a man. He was, however, a wayfarer on account of the passibility of His body, in respect of which He was "made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews 2:9</a>), by dispensation, and not on account of any defect on the part of His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Hence there is no comparison between Him and other wayfarers.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, remembered what he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in that vision, by means of certain intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> that remained in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>; even as in the absence of the sensible object, certain impressions remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which it recollects when it turns to the phantasms. And so this was the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that he was unable wholly to think over or express in words.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether, while in this state, Paul's soul was wholly separated from his body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that, while in this state, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was wholly separated from his body. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>): "While we are in the body we are absent from the Lord. For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not by sight" ['Per speciem,' i.e. by an intelligible <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>]. Now, while in that state, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not absent from the Lord, for he saw Him by a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (<a href="#3">Article 3</a>). Therefore he was not in the body.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be uplifted above the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> wherein it is rooted. Now in this <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, was withdrawn from its bodily surroundings through being uplifted to divine <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Much more therefore was the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separated from the body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the forces of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are more material than those of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now in order for him to be <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to be withdrawn from the forces of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Much more, therefore, was it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to be withdrawn from the forces of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now when these forces cease to operate, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is no longer in any way united to the body. Therefore it would seem that in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be wholly separated from the body.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Ep. CXLVII, 13, ad Paulin.; de videndo Deum): "It is not incredible that this sublime <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>" (namely, that they should see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>) "was vouchsafed certain <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, without their departing this life so completely as to leave nothing but a corpse for burial." Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, to be wholly separated from his body.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (1, Objection 1), in the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> of which we are speaking now, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is uplifted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power, "from that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to that which is above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>." Wherefore two things have to be considered: first, what pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; secondly, what has to be done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> above his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body as its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> form, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> disposition to understand by turning to phantasms; and this is not withdrawn by the divine power from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, since its state undergoes no change, as stated above (3, ad 2,3). Yet, this state remaining, actual conversion to phantasms and sensible objects is withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, lest it be hindered from being uplifted to that which transcends all phantasms, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>). Therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> should be so separated from the body as to cease to be united thereto as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>; and yet it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be withdrawn from phantasms and the perception of sensible objects.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In this <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was absent from the Lord as regards his state, since he was still in the state of a wayfarer, but not as regards the act by which he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, as stated above (3, ad 2,3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> A faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not uplifted by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> power above the mode becoming the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but it can be uplifted by the divine power to something higher, even as a body by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of a stronger power is lifted up above the place befitting it according to its specific <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The forces of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not operate through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being intent thereon, as do the sensitive forces, but by way of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Hence in the case of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> there is no need for withdrawal from them, as from the sensitive powers, whose operations would lessen the intentness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Did Paul know whether his soul were separated from his body?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were separated from his body. For he says (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>): "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> even to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> denotes something composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a> differs from death. Seemingly therefore he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not separated from his body by death, which is the more probable seeing that this is the common opinion of the Doctors.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, it appears from the same words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> whither he was rapt, since it was "to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Now this shows that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> whether he was in the body or not, for if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to be something corporeal, he must have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not separated from his body, since a corporeal thing cannot be an object of sight save through the body. Therefore it would seem that he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were separated from his body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 28) that "when in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, he saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the same vision as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> see Him in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Now from the very fact that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated from their body. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>): "Whether in the body, or out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> answer to this question must be gathered from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> very words, whereby he says he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> something, namely that he was "<a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> even to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," and that something he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, namely "whether" he were "in the body or out of the body." This may be understood in two ways. First, the words "whether in the body or out of the body" may refer not to the very being of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> (as though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were in his body or not), but to the mode of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, so that he ignored whether his body besides his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or, on the other hand, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, were <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> is stated (<a href="../bible/eze008.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 8:3</a>) to have been "brought in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> into Jerusalem." This was the explanation of a certain <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (Prolog. super Daniel.), where he says that "lastly our <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a>" (thus said the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>) "durst not assert that he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> in his body, but said: 'Whether in the body or out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.'"

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, however, disapproves of this explanation (Gen. ad lit. xii, 3 seqq.) for this reason that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> states that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> even to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Wherefore he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it to be really the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to which he was rapt, and not an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> likeness of the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: otherwise if he gave the name of third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, in the same way he might state that he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> in the body, meaning, by body, an image of his body, such as appears in one's dreams. Now if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it to be really the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, it follows that either he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it to be something <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and incorporeal, and then his body could not be <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> thither; or he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it to be something corporeal, and then his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> thither without his body, unless it were separated from his body. Consequently we must explain the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> otherwise, by saying that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself to be <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, but that he ignored how his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stood in relation to his body, to wit, whether it were accompanied by his body or not.

<p>Here we find a diversity of opinions. For some say that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be united to his body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, but ignored whether it were abstracted from its senses, or again whether it were abstracted from the operations of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But he could not but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was abstracted from the senses, seeing that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself to be rapt; and as to his being abstracted from the operation of the vegetative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, this was not of such importance as to require him to be so careful in mentioning it. It follows, then, that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> ignored whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were united to his body as its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, or separated from it by death. Some, however, granting this say that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> did not consider the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> while he was in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, because he was wholly intent upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that afterwards he questioned the point, when taking cognizance of what he had seen. But this also is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle's</a> words, for he there distinguishes between the past and what happened subsequently, since he states that at the present time he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> "fourteen years ago," and that at the present time he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not "whether he was in the body or out of the body."

<p>Consequently we must assert that both before and after he ignored whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were separated from his body. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Gen. ad lit. xii, 5), after discussing the question at length, concludes: "Perhaps then we must infer that he ignored whether, when he was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in his body (in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the body, when we speak of a living body either of a waking or of a sleeping <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or of one that is withdrawn from his bodily senses during <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>), or whether his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> went out of his body altogether, so that his body lay dead."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Sometimes by the figure of synecdoche a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the principal part, denotes a man. or again we might take this to mean that he whom he states to have been <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> was a man not at the time of his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, but fourteen years afterwards: for he says "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a man," not "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Again nothing hinders death brought about by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being called rapture; and thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 3): "If the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, who of us will dare to be certain about it?" Wherefore those who have something to say on this subject speak with more conjecture than <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that either the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in question was something incorporeal, or that he saw something incorporeal in that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; yet this could be done by his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, even without his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being separated from his body.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> vision, while he was in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapture</a>, was like the vision of the blessed in one respect, namely as to the thing seen; and, unlike, in another respect, namely as to the mode of seeing, because he saw not so perfectly as do the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 36): "Although, when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">rapt</a> from his carnal senses to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he lacked that full and perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things which is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whether he was in the body, or out of the body, this will surely not be lacking after reunion with the body in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, when this corruptible will put on incorruption."
