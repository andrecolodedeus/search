<h1>Question 176. The grace of tongues</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3176.htm#article1"> Does a man, by the grace of tongues, acquire the knowledge of all languages?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3176.htm#article2"> The comparison between this gift and the grace of prophecy</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether those who received the gift of tongues spoke in every language?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that those who received the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> did not speak in every language. For that which is granted to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by the divine power is the best of its kind: thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> turned the water into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> wine, as stated in <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse10">John 2:10</a>. Now those who had the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> spoke better in their own language; since a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/heb001.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, says that "it is not surprising that the epistle to the Hebrews is more graceful in style than the other epistles, since it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> for a man to have more command over his own than over a strange language. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> wrote the other epistles in a foreign, namely the Greek, idiom; whereas he wrote this in the Hebrew tongue." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all languages by a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not employ many means where one is sufficient; and much less does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Whose work is more orderly than <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature's</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could make His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be understood by all, while speaking one tongue: hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse6">Acts 2:6</a>, "Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> heard them speak in his own tongue," says that "they spoke in every tongue, or speaking in their own, namely the Hebrew language, were understood by all, as though they spoke the language proper to each." Therefore it would seem that they had not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to speak in all languages.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> flow from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John 1:16</a>, "Of His fullness we all have received." Now we do not read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke more than one language, nor does each one of the faithful now speak save in one tongue. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the extent of speaking in all languages.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse4">Acts 2:4</a>) that "they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> gave them to speak"; on which passage a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> [Hom. xxx in Ev.] says that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> appeared over the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> under the form of fiery tongues, and gave them the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all tongues."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> first <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were chosen by Him in order that they might disperse throughout the whole world, and preach His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> everywhere, according to <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a>, "Going . . . teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>." Now it was not fitting that they who were being sent to teach others should need to be taught by others, either as to how they should speak to other people, or as to how they were to understand those who spoke to them; and all the more seeing that those who were being sent were of one nation, that of Judea, according to <a href="../bible/isa027.htm#verse6">Isaiah 27:6</a>, "When they shall rush out from <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'When they shall rush in unto <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>,' etc.] . . . they shall fill the face of the world with seed." Moreover those who were being sent were poor and powerless; nor at the outset could they have easily found someone to interpret their words faithfully to others, or to explain what others said to them, especially as they were sent to unbelievers. Consequently it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in this respect, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should provide them with the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>; in order that, as the diversity of tongues was brought upon the nations when they fell away to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, according to <a href="../bible/gen011.htm">Genesis 11</a>, so when the nations were to be recalled to the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a remedy to this diversity might be applied by the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As it is written (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>), "the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is given to every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> unto profit"; and consequently both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were divinely instructed in the languages of all nations sufficiently for the requirements of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But as regards the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and elegance of style which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> art adds to a language, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> was instructed in his own, but not in a foreign tongue. Even so they were sufficiently instructed in wisdom and scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as required for teaching the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not as to all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by acquired science, for instance the conclusions of arithmetic and geometry.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Although either was possible, namely that, while speaking in one tongue they should be understood by all, or that they should speak in all tongues, it was more fitting that they should speak in all tongues, because this pertained to the perfection of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereby they were able not only to speak, but also to understand what was said by others. Whereas if their one language were intelligible to all, this would either have been due to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who understood their speech, or it would have amounted to an illusion, since a man's words would have had a different sound in another's ears, from that with which they were uttered. Hence a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says on <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse6">Acts 2:6</a> that "it was a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that they should speak all kinds of tongues"; and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>): "I thank my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I speak with all your tongues."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> purposed preaching to only one nation, namely the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. Consequently, although without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He possessed most perfectly the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all languages, there was no need for Him to speak in every tongue. And therefore, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xxxii in Joan.), "whereas even now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is received, yet no one speaks in the tongues of all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself already speaks the languages of all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: since whoever is not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, receives not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the gift of tongues is more excellent than the grace of prophecy?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For, seemingly, better things are proper to better <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Topic. iii, 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is proper to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, hence we sing in the sequence of Pentecost [The sequence: 'Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis gratia' ascribed to King Robert of France, the reputed author of the 'Veni Sancte Spiritus.' Cf. Migne, Patr. Lat. tom. CXLI]: "On this day Thou gavest <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Christ's apostles</a> an unwonted <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, a marvel to all time": whereas <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more pertinent to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, according to <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews 1:1</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that whereby we are directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seemingly more excellent than that whereby we are directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now, by the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> he is directed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for it is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 14:2-3</a>): "He that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . but he that prophesieth, speaketh unto men unto edification." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> abides like a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has it, and "he can use it when he will"; wherefore it is written (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse18">1 Corinthians 14:18</a>): "I thank my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I speak with all your tongues." But it is not so with the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as stated above (Question 171, Article 2). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> would seem to be more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the "interpretation of speeches" would seem to be contained under <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, because the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are expounded by the same Spirit from Whom they originated. Now the interpretation of speeches is placed after "divers kinds of tongues" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). Therefore it seems that the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, particularly as regards a part of the latter.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 14:5</a>): "Greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> surpasses the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, in three ways. First, because the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> regards the utterance of certain words, which signify an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this again is signified by the phantasms which appear in an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision; wherefore <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> compares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 8) the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> to an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision. On the other hand, it has been stated above (Question 173, Article 2) that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself being enlightened so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> an intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> enlightenment is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, as stated above (Question 174, Article 2), so also is <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> considered in itself. Secondly, because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> regards the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, which is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of words, to which the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> pertains.

<p>Thirdly, because the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more profitable. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> proves this in three ways (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>); first, because <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is more profitable to the edification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for which purpose he that speaketh in tongues profiteth nothing, unless interpretation follow (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 14:4-5</a>). Secondly, as regards the speaker himself, for if he be enabled to speak in divers tongues without understanding them, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, his own mind would not be edified (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 14:7-14</a>). Thirdly, as to unbelievers for whose especial benefit the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> seems to have been given; since perchance they might think those who speak in tongues to be mad (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse23">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>), for instance the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> deemed the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> drunk when the latter spoke in various tongues (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse13">Acts 2:13</a>): whereas by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a> the unbeliever is convinced, because the secrets of his heart are made manifest (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse25">Acts 2:25</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (174, 3, ad 1), it belongs to the excellence of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that a man is not only enlightened by an intelligible light, but also that he should perceive an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision: and so again it belongs to the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost's</a> operation, not only to fill the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> light, and the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> vision, as happened in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but also to endow the tongue with external erudition, in the utterance of various signs of speech. All this is done in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, "Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>," i.e. a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is more excellent than being directed to Him in his tongue. "He that speaketh in a tongue "is said to speak "not unto men," i.e. to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> understanding or profit, but unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> understanding and praise. On the other hand, by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> a man is directed both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; wherefore it is the more perfect <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Prophetic <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> extends to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>; wherefore from its very perfection it results that in this imperfect state of life it cannot be had perfectly by way of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but only imperfectly by way of passion. on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> is confined to a certain particular <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, namely of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> words; wherefore it is not inconsistent with the imperfection of this life, that it should be had perfectly and by way of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The interpretation of speeches is reducible to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is enlightened so as to understand and explain any obscurities of speech arising either from a difficulty in the things signified, or from the words uttered being unknown, or from the figures of speech employed, according to <a href="../bible/dan005.htm#verse16">Daniel 5:16</a>, "I have heard of thee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things." Hence the interpretation of speeches is more excellent than the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, as appears from the saying of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 14:5</a>), "Greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues; unless perhaps he interpret." Yet the interpretation of speeches is placed after the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, because the interpretation of speeches extends even to the interpretation of divers kinds of tongues.
