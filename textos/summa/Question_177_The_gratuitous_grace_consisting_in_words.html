<h1>Question 177. The gratuitous grace consisting in words</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3177.htm#article1"> Does any gratuitous grace attach to words?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3177.htm#article2"> To whom is the grace becoming?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether any gratuitous grace attaches to words?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not attach to words. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given for that which surpasses the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> has devised the art of rhetoric whereby a man is able to speak so as to teach, please, and persuade, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Doctr. Christ. iv, 12). Now this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of words. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of words is not a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> pertains to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>): "The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not in speech, but in power." Therefore there is no gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> connected with words.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given through <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>, since "if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not now of works" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans 11:6</a>). But the word is sometimes given to a man on his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. xi, 15) in explanation of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse43">Psalm 118:43</a>, "Take not Thou the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> utterly out of my mouth" that "the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> gives to them that do it, and takes away from them that do it not." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the word is not a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, it behooves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to declare in words things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no less than those pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom or of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore if the word of wisdom and the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are reckoned gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should likewise be placed among the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse5">Sirach 6:5</a>): "A gracious tongue in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall abound [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'aboundeth']." Now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore graciousness in words is also by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are given for the profit of others, as stated above (I-II, 111, 1,4). Now the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> a man receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be turned to another's profit, except by means of speech. And since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> does not fail in anything that pertains to the profit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He provides also the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with speech; to the effect that a man not only speaks so as to be understood by different people, which pertains to the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, but also speaks with effect, and this pertains to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> "of the word."

<p>This happens in three ways. First, in order to instruct the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and this is the case when a man speaks so as "to teach." Secondly, in order to move the affections, so that a man willingly hearkens to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is the case when a man speaks so as "to please" his hearers, not indeed with a view to his own favor, but in order to draw them to listen to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word. Thirdly, in order that men may love that which is signified by the word, and desire to fulfill it, and this is the case when a man so speaks as "to sway" his hearers. On order to effect this the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> makes use of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tongue as of an instrument; but He it is Who perfects the work within. Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for Pentecost (Hom. xxx in Ev.): "Unless the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fill the hearts of the hearers, in vain does the voice of the teacher resound in the ears of the body."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Even as by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes works in a more excellent way those things which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> also can work, so too the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> effects more excellently by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of words that which art can effect in a less efficient manner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> is speaking there of the word that relies on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eloquence without the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Wherefore he says just before (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 4:19</a>): "I . . . will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power": and of himself he had already said (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>): "My speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, but in the showing of the spirit and power."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As stated above, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is given to a man for the profit of others. Hence it is withdrawn sometimes through the fault of the hearer, and sometimes through the fault of the speaker. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works of either of them do not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> directly, but only remove the obstacles thereto. For <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> also is withdrawn on account of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> fault, and yet he does not <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> it by his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, which, however, remove the obstacles to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As stated above, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is directed to the profit of others. Now if a man communicates his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to others this is by the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or of wisdom. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may profit the godly and be defended against the ungodly, is apparently what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> means by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." Hence it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to mention the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but it was sufficient for him to mention the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of wisdom.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the grace of the word of wisdom and knowledge is becoming to women?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is becoming even to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For teaching is pertinent to this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as stated in the foregoing Article. Now it is becoming to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach; for it is written (<a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse3">Proverbs 4:3-4</a>): "I was an only son in the sight of my mother, and she taught me [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'I was my father's son, tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother. And he taught me.']." Therefore this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is becoming to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word, even as the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is greater than its utterance. But <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is granted to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as we read of Deborah (<a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#verse4">Judges 4:4</a>), and of Holda the prophetess, the wife of Sellum (<a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse14">2 Kings 22:14</a>), and of the four daughters of Philip (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse9">Acts 21:9</a>). Moreover the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>): "Every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> or prophesying," etc. Much more therefore would it seem that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is becoming to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, it is written (<a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse10">1 Peter 4:10</a>): "As every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> ministering the same one to another." Now some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which they cannot minister to others except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is becoming to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>): "Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> keep silence in the churches," and (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>): "I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach." Now this pertains especially to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is not becoming to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Speech may be employed in two ways: in one way privately, to one or a few, in familiar conversation, and in this respect the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word may be becoming to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; in another way, publicly, addressing oneself to the whole church, and this is not permitted to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. First and chiefly, on account of the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> attaching to the female sex, whereby <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as appears from <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis 3:16</a>. Now teaching and persuading publicly in the church belong not to subjects but to the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (although men who are subjects may do these things if they be so commissioned, because their subjection is not a result of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sex, as it is with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but of some thing supervening by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>). Secondly, lest men's minds be enticed to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for it is written (<a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse11">Sirach 9:11</a>): "Her conversation burneth as fire." Thirdly, because as a rule <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not perfected in wisdom, so as to be fit to be intrusted with public teaching.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The passage quoted speaks of private teaching whereby a father instructs his son.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> consists in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enlightening the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, on the part of which there is no difference of sex among men, according to <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians 3:10-11</a>, "Putting on the new" <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, "him who is renewed unto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the image of Him that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> him, where there is neither male nor female [<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>: 'Neither <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.' Cf. I, 93, 6, ad 2 footnote]." Now the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word pertains to the instruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> among whom the difference of sex is found. Hence the comparison fails.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The recipients of a divinely conferred <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> administer it in different ways according to their various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, if they have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of wisdom or of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, can administer it by teaching privately but not publicly.
