<h1>Question 178. The grace of miracles</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/3178.htm#article1"> Is there a gratuitous grace of working miracles?</a> <li><a href="../summa/3178.htm#article2"> To whom is it becoming?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there is a gratuitous grace of working miracles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that no gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is directed to the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For every <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> puts something in the one to whom it is given (Cf. I-II, 90, 1). Now the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> puts nothing in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who receives it since <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought at the touch even of a dead body. Thus we read (<a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#verse21">2 Kings 13:21</a>) that "some . . . cast the body into the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> came to life, and stood upon his feet." Therefore the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> does not belong to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a>, "There are diversities of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, but the same Spirit." Now the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is effected even by the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> spirit, according to <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew 24:24</a>, "There shall arise <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Christs and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and shall show great signs and wonders." Therefore it would seem that the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> does not belong to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are divided into "signs," "wonders" or "portents," and "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." [Cf. <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay version</a> renders 'virtus' by 'power.' The use of the word '<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>' in the sense of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is now obsolete, and the generic term '<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>' is elsewhere used in its stead: Cf. <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 12:10-28</a>; <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse4">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse22">Acts 2:22</a>. Therefore it is unreasonable to reckon the "working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>" a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, any more than the "working of signs" and "wonders."

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> restoring to health is done by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing should not be distinguished from the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> results from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>--either of the worker, according to <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, "If I should have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I could remove mountains," or of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for whose sake <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought, according to <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse58">Matthew 13:58</a>, "And He wrought not many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there, because of their unbelief." Therefore, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be reckoned a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is superfluous to reckon in addition the working of signs as another gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>) says that among other gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, "to another" is given "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing . . . to another, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (Question 177, Article 1), the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> provides sufficiently for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in matters profitable unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to which purpose the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> are directed. Now just as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which a man receives from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> needs to be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of others through the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word, so too the word uttered needs to be confirmed in order that it be rendered credible. This is done by the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse20">Mark 16:20</a>, "And confirming the word with signs that followed": and reasonably so. For it is <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to arrive at the intelligible <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through its sensible effects. Wherefore just as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> led by his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is able to arrive at some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> effects, so is he brought to a certain degree of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by certain <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> effects which are called <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Therefore the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> belongs to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Just as <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> extends to whatever can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> supernaturally, so the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> extends to all things that can be done supernaturally; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereof is the divine omnipotence which cannot be communicated to any creature. Hence it is impossible for the principle of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> abiding as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. On the other hand, just as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>'s mind is moved by divine inspiration to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something supernaturally, so too is it possible for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worker to be moved to do something resulting in the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> effect which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> by His power. Sometimes this takes place after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as when Peter raised to life the dead Tabitha (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse40">Acts 9:40</a>): sometimes without any previous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> being expressed, as when Peter by upbraiding the lying Ananias and Saphira delivered them to death (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse4">Acts 5:4-9</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. ii, 30) that "the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, sometimes by authority, sometimes by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." On either case, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principal worker, for He uses instrumentally either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> inward movement, or his speech, or some outward action, or again the bodily contact of even a dead body. Thus when <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> had said as though authoritatively (<a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse12">Joshua 10:12</a>): "Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon," it is said afterwards (<a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse14">Joshua 10:14</a>): "There was not before or after so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice of a man."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is speaking there of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to be wrought at the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) that the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> will be "according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders." To quote the words of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (De Civ. Dei xx, 19), "it is a matter of debate whether they are called signs and lying wonders, because he will deceive the senses of mortals by <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> visions, in that he will seem to do what he does not, or because, though they be real wonders, they will <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduce</a> into falsehood them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>." They are said to be real, because the things themselves will be real, just as <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> magicians made real frogs and real serpents; but they will not be real <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, because they will be done by the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a>, as stated in I, 114, 4; whereas the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which is ascribed to a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> profit.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Two things may be considered in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. One is that which is done: this is something surpassing the faculty of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and in this respect <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are called "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>." The other thing is the purpose for which <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought, namely the manifestation of something <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and in this respect they are commonly called "signs": but on account of some excellence they receive the name of "wonder" or "prodigy," as showing something from afar [procul].

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> The "<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing" is mentioned separately, because by its means a benefit, namely bodily health, is conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in addition to the common benefit bestowed in all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, namely the bringing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for two reasons. First, because it is directed to the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, secondly, because it proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> omnipotence on which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> relies. Nevertheless, just as besides the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the word is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that people may be instructed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so too is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that people may be confirmed in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the wicked can work miracles?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cannot work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as stated above (1, ad 1). Now the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of a sinner is not granted, according to <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John 9:31</a>, "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners," and <a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse9">Proverbs 28:9</a>, "He that turneth away his ear from hearing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall be an abomination." Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cannot work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are ascribed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse19">Matthew 17:19</a>, "If you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove." Now "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without works is dead," according to (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse20">James 2:20</a>), so that, seemingly, it is devoid of its proper operation. Therefore it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, since they do not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, cannot work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are divine attestations, according to <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse4">Hebrews 2:4</a>, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>": wherefore in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the canonization of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is based on the attestation of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot bear witness to a falsehood. Therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men cannot work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are more closely united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> do not all work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Much less therefore do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>): "If I should have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I could remove mountains, and have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, I am nothing." Now whosoever has not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, because "this <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> alone of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> distinguishes the children of the kingdom from the children of perdition," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. xv, 18). Therefore it would seem that even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginary</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, because they delude <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the appearance of that which is not; while others are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, yet they have not the character of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, because they are done by the power of some <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Both of these can be done by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as stated above (1, ad 2).

<p><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> cannot be wrought save by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works them for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> benefit, and this in two ways: in one way for the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> declared, in another way in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> desires to propose as an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the first way <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> can be wrought by any one who preaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and calls upon Christ's name, as even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do sometimes. On this way even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> can work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commenting</a> on <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew 7:22</a>, "Have not we <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> in Thy name?" says: "Sometimes prophesying, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the casting out of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are accorded not to the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of those who do these things, but to the invoking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name, that men may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by invoking Whom such great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought."

<p>In the second way <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not wrought except by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, since it is in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought during their lifetime or after death, either by themselves or by others. For we read (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse11">Acts 19:11-12</a>) that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought by the hand of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>" and "even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs . . . and the diseases departed from them." On this way indeed there is nothing to prevent a sinner from working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by invoking a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is ascribed not to him, but to the one in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> such things are done.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As stated above (Question 83, Article 16) when we were treating of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of impetration relies not on <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> but on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy, which extends even to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> even of sinners are sometimes granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Tract. xliv in Joan.) that "the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke these words before he was anointed," that is, before he was perfectly enlightened; "since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does hear sinners." When it is said that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of one who hears not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is an abomination, this must be understood so far as the sinner's <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is concerned; yet it is sometimes granted, either for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> welfare of the one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>--as the publican was heard (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke 18:1</a>)4)--or for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of others and for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> without works is said to be dead, as regards the believer, who lives not, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But nothing hinders a living thing from working through a dead instrument, as a man through a stick. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works while employing instrumentally the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a sinner.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Miracles are always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to the purpose for which they are wrought. Hence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men who teach a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrine never work <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in confirmation of their teaching, although sometimes they may do so in praise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name which they invoke, and by the power of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which they administer. If they teach a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, sometimes they work <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as confirming their teaching, but not as an attestation of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 79): "Magicians work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in one way, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in another, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in another. Magicians by private compact with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by their manifest righteousness, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the outward signs of righteousness."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 79), "the reason why these are not granted to all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men is lest by a most baneful <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the weak be deceived into thinking such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to imply greater <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> than the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of righteousness whereby <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a> is obtained."
