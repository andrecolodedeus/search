<h1>Question 17. Christ's unity of being</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/4017.htm#article1"> Is Christ one or two?</a> <li><a href="../summa/4017.htm#article2"> Is there only one being in Christ?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether Christ is one or two?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not one, but two. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Trin. i, 7): "Because the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took the form of a servant, both are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by reason of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who assumed, yet both are Man by reason of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> assumed." Now "both" may only be said when there are two. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, where there is one thing and another there are two. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one thing and another; for <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion xxxv): "Being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . He took the form of a servant . . . being both in one; but He was one of these as Word, and the other as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for, if He were a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He would not be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore He is something else than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and thus in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is one thing and another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is something that the Father is, and something that the Father is not. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one thing and another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, as in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> there are three Persons in one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, so in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> there are two natures in one Person. But on account of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, notwithstanding the distinction of Person, the Father and Son are one, according to <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John 10:30</a>: "I and the Father are one." Therefore, notwithstanding the unity of Person, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two on account of the duality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 6.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Phys. iii, text. 18) that "one" and "two" are predicated denominatively. Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has a duality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Objection 7.</strong> Further, as <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> form makes a thing otherwise [alterum] so does <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form make another thing [aliud] as Porphyry says (Praedic.). Now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and the Divine. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one thing and another. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> says (De Duab. Nat.): "Whatever is, inasmuch as it is, is one." But we confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, considered in itself, as it is used in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, cannot <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be predicated of the suppositum or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, except in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom "what it is" and "whereby it is" do not differ, as stated in I, 29, 4, ad 1. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, viz. the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, one of them, viz. the Divine, may be predicated of Him both in the abstract and in the concrete, for we say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who is signified by the word <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> and is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> cannot be predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but only in the concrete, i.e. as it is signified by the suppositum. For we cannot <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>," because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> predicated of its suppositum. But we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a man, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> signifies one having the Godhead, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> signifies one having manhood. Yet one having manhood is differently signified by the word "man" and by the word "Jesus" or "Peter." For this word "<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>" implies one having manhood indistinctly, even as the word "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" implies indistinctly one having the Godhead; but the word "Peter" or "Jesus" implies one having manhood distinctly, i.e. with its determinate <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> properties, as "<a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" implies one having the Godhead under a determinate personal property. Now the dual number is placed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Hence, if both the natures were predicated in the abstract of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it would follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two. But because the two natures are not predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, except as they are signified in the suppositum, it must be by reason of the suppositum that "one" or "two" be predicated of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Now some placed two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and one Person, which, in their opinion, would seem to be the suppositum completed with its final completion. Hence, since they placed two supposita in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is two, in the neuter. But because they asserted one Person, they said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one, in the masculine, for the neuter gender signifies something unformed and imperfect, whereas the masculine signifies something formed and perfect. on the other hand, the Nestorians, who asserted two Persons in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two not only in the neuter, but also in the masculine. But since we maintain one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and one suppositum in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as is clear from 2, 2,3, it follows that we say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one not merely in the masculine, but also in the neuter.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> This saying of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> is not to be taken as if "both" referred to the predicate, so as to mean that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is both; but it refers to the subject. And thus "both" does not stand for two supposita, but for two words signifying two natures in the concrete. For I can say that "both, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man, are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who assumes; and "both, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man," are Man on account of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> assumed.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> When it is said that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one thing and another," this saying is to be explained in this sense--"having this <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and another." And it is in this way that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> explains it (Contra Felic. xi), where, after saying, "In the mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is one thing, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> another," he adds: "I say another thing by reason of the difference of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and not another thing by reason of the unity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>." Hence <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> says (Ep. ad Chelid. ci): "If we must speak briefly, that of which the Saviour is, is one thing and another; thus the invisible is not the same as the visible; and what is without time is not the same as what is in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Yet they are not one and another: far from it; for both these are one."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>"; because it does not exclude another suppositum, but another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, since terms placed in the predicate are taken formally. But if anything is added whereby it is drawn to the suppositum, it would be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> proposition--for instance, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only that which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Nevertheless, it would not follow that He is "any other thing than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>," because "another thing," inasmuch as it refers to a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, properly refers to the suppositum. even as all relative things bearing a personal relation. But it does follow: "Therefore He has another <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> When it is said, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is something that the Father is"; "something" signifies the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is predicated even in the abstract of the Father and Son. But when it is said: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is something that is not the Father"; "something" signifies, not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it is in the <a href="../cathen/01074a.htm">abstract</a>, but as it is in the concrete; not, indeed, in a distinct, but in an indistinct suppositum, i.e. inasmuch as it underlies the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and not the individuating properties. Hence it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one thing and another, or that He is two, since the suppositum of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, does not reckon numerically with the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, which is predicated of the Father and Son.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> is predicated, even in the abstract of the three Persons; hence it may be said simply that the three Persons are one. But in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> both natures are not predicated in the abstract of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; hence it cannot be said simply that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 6.</strong> Two signifies what has duality, not in another, but in the same thing of which "two" is predicated. Now what is predicated is said of the suppositum, which is implied by the word "Christ." Hence, although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has duality of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, yet, because He has not duality of suppositum, it cannot be said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is two.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 7.</strong> Otherwise implies diversity of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. Hence diversity of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> suffices for anything to be called "otherwise" simply. But "another thing" implies diversity of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Now not merely the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but also the suppositum is said to be a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, as is said Metaph. v, text. 15. Hence diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not suffice for anything to be called "another thing" simply, unless there is diversity of suppositum. But diversity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> makes "another thing" relatively, i.e. in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, if there is no diversity of suppositum.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is only one being in Christ?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is not merely one being, but two. For <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. iii, 13) that whatever follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is doubled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But being follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for being is from the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Hence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two beings.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the being of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> itself, and is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: whereas the being of the Man Christ is not the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, but is a temporal being. Therefore there is not only one being in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, although there are three Persons, yet on account of the unity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is only one being. But in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, though there is one Person. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is not only one being.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gives some being to the body, since it is its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. But it does not give the Divine being, since this is uncreated. Therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is another being besides the Divine being; and thus in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there is not only one being.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Everything is said to be a being, inasmuch as it is one, for one and being are convertible. Therefore, if there were two beings in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not one only, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would be two, and not one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Because in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> there are two natures and one hypostasis, it follows that things belonging to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> must be two; and that those belonging to the hypostasis in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> must be only one. Now being pertains both to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to the hypostasis; to the hypostasis as to that which has being--and to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as to that whereby it has being. For <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is taken after the manner of a form, which is said to be a being because something is by it; as by whiteness a thing is white, and by manhood a thing is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now it must be borne in mind that if there is a form or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which does not pertain to the personal being of the subsisting hypostasis, this being is not said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> simply, but relatively; as to be white is the being of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, not as he is <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, but inasmuch as he is white. And there is no reason why this being should not be multiplied in one hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; for the being whereby <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> is white is distinct from the being whereby he is a musician. But the being which belongs to the very hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in itself cannot possibly be multiplied in one hypostasis or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since it is impossible that there should not be one being for one thing.

<p>If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> accrued to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not hypostatically or personally, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as some maintained, it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assert two beings in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>--one, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--the other, inasmuch as He is Man; even as in <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> we place one being inasmuch as he is white, and another inasmuch as he is a man, since "being white" does not pertain to the personal being of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. But being possessed of a head, being corporeal, being animated--all these pertain to the one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, and hence there arises from these only the one being of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. And if it so happened that after the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> was constituted there accrued to him hands or feet or eyes, as happened to him who was born blind, no new being would be thereby added to <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, but only a relation to these, i.e. inasmuch as he would be said to be, not only with reference to what he had previously, but also with reference to what accrued to him afterwards. And thus, since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, hypostatically or personally as was said above (2, 5,6), and not <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, it follows that by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there accrued to Him no new personal being, but only a new relation of the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existing</a> personal being to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, in such a way that the Person is said to subsist not merely in the Divine, but also in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Being is consequent upon <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not as upon that which has being, but as upon that whereby a thing is: whereas it is consequent upon <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or hypostasis, as upon that which has being. Hence it has unity from the unity of hypostasis, rather than duality from the duality of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> being of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which is the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, becomes the being of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is assumed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to unity of Person.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As was said in I, 50, 2, ad 3; I, 75, 5, ad 4, since the Divine Person is the same as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, there is no distinction in the Divine Persons between the being of the Person and the being of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, and, consequently, the three Persons have only one being. But they would have a triple being if the being of the Person were distinct in them from the being of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gives being to the body, inasmuch as it makes it actually animated, which is to give it the complement of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. But if we consider the body perfected by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, without the hypostasis having both--this whole, composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, as signified by the word "humanity," does not signify "what is," but "whereby it is." Hence being belongs to the subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, inasmuch as it has a relation to such a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and of this relation the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, inasmuch as it perfects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by informing the body.
