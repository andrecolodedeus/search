<h1>Question 17. Falsity</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/1017.htm#article1"> Does falsity exist in things?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1017.htm#article2"> Does it exist in the sense?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1017.htm#article3"> Does it exist in the intellect?</a> <li><a href="../summa/1017.htm#article4"> The opposition of the true and the false</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether falsity exists in things?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It appears that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in things. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 8), "If the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is that which is, it will be concluded that the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> nowhere; whatever reason may appear to the contrary."

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is derived from "fallere" [to deceive]. But things do not deceive; for, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 33), they show nothing but their own <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is not found in things.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in things by conformity to the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as stated above (<a href="#16">Article 16</a>). But everything, in so far as it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, imitates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore everything is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> without admixture of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>; and thus nothing is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 34): "Every body is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> unity: for it imitates unity without being unity." But everything imitates the divine unity yet falls short of it. Therefore in all things <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are opposed, and since opposites stand in relation to the same thing, we must needs seek <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>, where primarily we find <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Now, in things, neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a>, except in relation to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. And since every thing is denominated simply by what belongs to it "per se," but is denominated relatively by what belongs to it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>; a thing indeed may be called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> simply when compared with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> on which it depends, and to which it is compared "per se" but may be called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> relatively as directed to another <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to which it is compared <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things depend on the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as artificial things on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Wherefore artificial things are said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> simply and in themselves, in so far as they fall short of the form of the art; whence a craftsman is said to produce a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> work, if it falls short of the proper operation of his art.

<p>In things that depend on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, falseness cannot be found, in so far as they are compared with the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; since whatever takes place in things proceeds from the ordinance of that <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, unless perhaps in the case of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agents only, who have it in their power to withdraw themselves from what is so ordained; wherein consists the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> themselves are called untruths and lies in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, according to the words of the text, "Why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?" (<a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse3">Psalm 4:3</a>): as on the other hand <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are called the "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of life" as being obedient to the order of the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Thus it is said, "He that doth <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, cometh to the light" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse21">John 3:21</a>).

<p>But in relation to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things which are compared thereto <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, can be called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; not simply, but relatively; and that in two ways. In one way according to the thing signified, and thus a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as being signified or represented by word or thought that is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. In this respect anything can be said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as regards any <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> not possessed by it; as if we should say that a diameter is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> commensurable thing, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, 34). So, too, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 10): "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tragedian is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Hector": even as, on the contrary, anything can be called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in regard to that which is becoming to it. In another way a thing can be called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, by way of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>--and thus a thing is said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> begets a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion. And whereas it is innate in us to judge things by external appearances, since our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> takes its rise from sense, which principally and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> deals with external <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, therefore those external <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a>, which resemble things other than themselves, are said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> with respect to those things; thus gall is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> honey; and tin, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gold. Regarding this, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 6): "We call those things <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that appear to our apprehension like the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>:" and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, 34): "Things are called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> apt to appear such as they are not, or what they are not." In this way a man is called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> as delighting in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions or words, and not because he can invent them; for in this way many wise and learned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might be called <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as stated in Metaph. v, 34.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> A thing compared with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in respect to what it is; and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in respect to what it is not. Hence, "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tragedian is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Hector," as stated in Soliloq. ii, 6. As, therefore, in things that are is found a certain non-being, so in things that are is found a degree of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falseness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Things do not deceive by their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>. For they give occasion to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>, by the likeness they bear to things which they actually are not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Things are said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, not as compared with the divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in which case they would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> simply, but as compared with our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; and thus they are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> only relatively.

<p>To the argument which is urged on the contrary, likeness or defective representation does not involve the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> except in so far as it gives occasion to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion. Hence a thing is not always said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, because it resembles another thing; but only when the resemblance is such as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to produce a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion, not in any one case, but in the majority of instances.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether there is falsity in the senses?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is not in the senses. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Vera Relig. 33): "If all the bodily senses report as they are affected, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what more we can require from them." Thus it seems that we are not deceived by the senses; and therefore that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is not in them.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iv, 24) that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is not proper to the senses, but to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in non-complex things there is neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, but in complex things only. But affirmation and negation do not belong to the senses. Therefore in the senses there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 6), "It appears that the senses entrap us into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by their deceptive similitudes."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Falsity is not to be sought in the senses except as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in them. Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in them in such a way as that the senses <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but in so far as they apprehend sensible things <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, as said above (Question 16, Article 2), and this takes place through the senses apprehending things as they are, and hence it happens that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exists</a> in the senses through their apprehending or judging things to be otherwise than they really are.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things by the senses is in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of their likeness in the senses; and the likeness of a thing can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the senses in three ways. In the first way, primarily and of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as in sight there is the likeness of colors, and of other sensible objects proper to it.

<p>Secondly, of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, though not primarily; as in sight there is the likeness of shape, size, and of other sensible objects common to more than one sense.

<p>Thirdly, neither primarily nor of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, as in sight, there is the likeness of a man, not as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but in so far as it is <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to the colored object to be a man.

<p>Sense, then, has no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about its proper objects, except <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> and rarely, and then, because of the unsound organ it does not receive the sensible form rightly; just as other passive subjects because of their indisposition receive defectively the impressions of the agent. Hence, for instance, it happens that on account of an unhealthy tongue sweet seems bitter to a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But as to common objects of sense, and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> objects, even a rightly disposed sense may have a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> judgment, because it is referred to them not directly, but <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a>, or as a consequence of being directed to other things.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The affection of sense is its sensation itself. Hence, from the fact that sense reports as it is affected, it follows that we are not deceived in the judgment by which we judge that we experience sensation. Since, however, sense is sometimes affected erroneously of that object, it follows that it sometimes reports erroneously of that object; and thus we are deceived by sense about the object, but not about the fact of sensation.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Falsity is said not to be proper to sense, since sense is not deceived as to its proper object. Hence in another translation it is said more plainly, "Sense, about its proper object, is never <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>." Falsity is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, as it represents the likeness of something even in its absence. Hence, when anyone perceives the likeness of a thing as if it were the thing itself, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> results from such an apprehension; and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. v, 34) that shadows, pictures, and dreams are said to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> inasmuch as they convey the likeness of things that are not present in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument proves that the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is not in the sense, as in that which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether falsity is in the intellect?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is not in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Qq. lxxxiii, 32), "Everyone who is deceived, understands not that in which he is deceived." But <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is said to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in so far as we are deceived therein. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (De Anima iii, 51) that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is always right. Therefore there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is said in De Anima iii, 21, 22 that "where there is composition of objects understood, there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood." But such composition is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Just as a thing has being by its proper form, so the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> faculty has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the likeness of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things cannot fall short of the being that belongs to them by their form, but may fall short of <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> or consequent <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">qualities</a>, even as a man may fail to possess two feet, but not fail to be a man; so the faculty of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> cannot fail in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the thing with the likeness of which it is informed; but may fail with regard to something consequent upon that form, or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> thereto. For it has been said (2) that sight is not deceived in its proper sensible, but about common sensibles that are consequent to that object; or about <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> objects of sense. Now as the sense is directly informed by the likeness of its proper object, so is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> by the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing. Hence the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not deceived about the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, as neither the sense about its proper object. But in affirming and denying, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may be deceived, by attributing to the thing of which it understands the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, something which is not consequent upon it, or is opposed to it. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is in the same position as regards judging of such things, as sense is as to judging of common, or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a>, sensible objects. There is, however, this difference, as before mentioned regarding <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (16, 2), that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> can <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> not only because the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is conscious of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as it is conscious of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; whereas in sense <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a> as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as stated above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>).

<p>But because <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is concerned <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> only with the composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> occurs also <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> in that operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> whereby it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing, in so far as composition of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is mixed up in it. This can take place in two ways. In one way, by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> applying to one thing the definition proper to another; as that of a circle to a man. Wherefore the definition of one thing is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> of another. In another way, by composing a definition of parts which are mutually exclusive. For thus the definition is not only <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> of the thing, but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in itself. A definition such as " a reasonable four-footed animal" would be of this kind, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in making it; for such a statement as "some reasonable animals are four-footed" is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in itself. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of simple <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a>; but it is either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or it understands nothing at all.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Because the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of a thing is the proper object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, we are properly said to understand a thing when we reduce it to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and judge of it thereby; as takes place in demonstrations, in which there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>. In this sense <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> words must be understood, "that he who is deceived, understands not that wherein he is deceived;" and not in the sense that no one is ever deceived in any operation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is always right as regards first principles; since it is not deceived about them for the same reason that it is not deceived about what a thing is. For self-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> principles are such as are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as soon as the terms are understood, from the fact that the predicate is contained in the definition of the subject.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether true and false are contraries?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It seems that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are not contraries. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are opposed, as that which is to that which is not; for "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Soliloq. ii, 5), "is that which is." But that which is and that which is not are not opposed as contraries. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are not contrary things.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, one of two contraries is not in the other. But <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says, (Soliloq. ii, 10), "A tragedian would not be a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Hector, if he were not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tragedian." Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are not contraries.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no contrariety, for "nothing is contrary to the Divine Substance," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xii, 2). But <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> is called in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, "They have laid hold on lying" (<a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 8:5</a>), that is to say, "an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>," as a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> says. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are not contraries.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Peri Herm. ii), that a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion is contrary to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are opposed as contraries, and not, as some have said, as affirmation and negation. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which it must be considered that negation neither asserts anything nor determines any subject, and can therefore be said of being as of not-being, for instance not-seeing or not-sitting. But privation asserts nothing, whereas it determines its subject, for it is "negation in a subject," as stated in Metaph. iv, 4: v. 27; for blindness is not said except of one whose <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> it is to see. Contraries, however, both assert something and determine the subject, for blackness is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of color. Falsity asserts something, for a thing is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Metaph. iv, 27), inasmuch as something is said or seems to be something that it is not, or not to be what it really is. For as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> implies an adequate apprehension of a thing, so <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> implies the contrary. Hence it is clear that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are contraries.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> What is in things is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the thing; but what is apprehended, is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> primarily resides. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> is that which is not as apprehended. To apprehend being, and not-being, implies contrariety; for, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> proves (Peri Herm. ii), the contrary of this statement "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," is, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Falsity is not founded in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is contrary to it, just as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not founded in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is contrary to it, but in that which is its proper subject. This happens in either, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are universals, and convertible with being. Hence, as every privation is founded in a subject, that is a being, so every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is founded in some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> in some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Because contraries, and opposites by way of privation, are by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> about one and the same thing, therefore there is nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, considered in Himself, either with respect to His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for in His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But in our apprehension of Him contraries <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">exist</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion concerning Him is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. So <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are called lies, opposed to the divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion concerning them is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion of the divine unity.
