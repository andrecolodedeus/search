<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether hope is a virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For "no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> makes ill use of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18). But one may make ill use of hope, since the passion of hope, like the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, is subject to a mean and extremes. Therefore hope is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> results from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, since "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in us without us," as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. xvii). But hope is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iii, D, 26). Therefore hope is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, "<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the disposition of a perfect thing" (Phys. vii, text. 17,18). But hope is the disposition of an imperfect thing, of one, namely, that lacks what it hopes to have. Therefore hope is not a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 33) that the three daughters of <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a> signify these three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore hope is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. ii, 6) "the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a thing is that which makes its subject <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and its work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> likewise." Consequently wherever we find a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, it must correspond to some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now in all things measured and ruled, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is that which attains its proper rule: thus we say that a coat is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if it neither exceeds nor falls short of its proper measurement. But, as we stated above (8, 3, ad 3) <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> have a twofold measure; one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the reason, while the other is remote and excelling, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: wherefore every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which attains reason or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. Now the act of hope, whereof we speak now, attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, as we have already stated (I-II, 40, 1), when we were treating of the passion of hope, the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, difficult but possible to obtain. Now a thing is possible to us in two ways: first, by ourselves; secondly, by means of others, as stated in Ethic. iii. Wherefore, in so far as we hope for anything as being possible to us by means of the Divine assistance, our hope attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, on Whose help it leans. It is therefore evident that hope is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causes</a> a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and to attain its due rule.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the mean of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on right reason being attained, wherein also consists the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore in hope too, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> depends on a man's attaining, by hoping, the due rule, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot make ill use of hope which attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as neither can he make ill use of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which attains the reason, because to attain thus is to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> use of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Nevertheless, the hope of which we speak now, is not a <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a> but a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as we shall show further on (5; 18, 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope is said to arise from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, as regards the thing hoped for, in so far as we hope to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>; or as regards the act of living hope. The <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> itself of hope, whereby we hope to obtain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, does not flow from our <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> He who hopes is indeed imperfect in relation to that which he hopes to obtain, but has not as yet; yet he is perfect, in so far as he already attains his proper rule, viz. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on Whose help he leans.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether eternal happiness is the proper object of hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not the proper object of hope. For a man does not hope for that which surpasses every movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since hope itself is a movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> surpasses every movement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>) that it hath not "entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>." Therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not the proper object of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is an expression of hope, for it is written (<a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse5">Psalm 36:5</a>): "Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in Him, and He will do it." Now it is lawful for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but also for the goods, both temporal and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, of the present life, and, as evidenced by the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, to be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which will no longer be in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not the proper object of hope.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the object of hope is something difficult. Now many things besides <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> are difficult to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not the proper object of hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse19">Hebrews 6:19</a>) that we have hope "which entereth in," i.e. maketh us to enter . . . "within the veil," i.e. into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to the interpretation of a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on these words. Therefore the object of hope is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), the hope of which we speak now, attains <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by leaning on His help in order to obtain the hoped for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now an effect must be proportionate to its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which we ought to hope for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> properly and chiefly is the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which is proportionate to the power of our divine helper, since it belongs to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power to lead anyone to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, which consists in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. For we should hope from Him for nothing less than Himself, since His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, whereby He imparts <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to His creature, is no less than His Essence. Therefore the proper and principal object of hope is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not enter into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perfectly, i.e. so that it be possible for a wayfarer to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a>; yet, under the general notion of the perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is possible for it to be apprehended by a man, and it is in this way that the movement of hope towards it arises. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says pointedly (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse19">Hebrews 6:19</a>) that hope "enters in, even within the veil," because that which we hope for is as yet veiled, so to speak.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> We ought not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for any other goods, except in reference to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Hence hope regards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> chiefly, and other things, for which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it regards secondarily and as referred to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> principally, and, secondarily, those things which are referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as stated above (Question 1, Article 1).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> To him that longs for something great, all lesser things seem small; wherefore to him that hopes for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, nothing else appears arduous, as compared with that hope; although, as compared with the capability of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who hopes, other things besides may be arduous to him, so that he may have hope for such things in reference to its principal object.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether one man may hope for another's eternal happiness?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that one may hope for another's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse6">Philippians 1:6</a>): "Being confident of this very thing, that He Who hath begun a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work in you, will perfect it unto the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Now the perfection of that day will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may hope for another's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever we ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we hope to obtain from Him. But we ask <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to bring others to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse16">James 5:16</a>: "Pray for one another that you may be saved." Therefore we can hope for another's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> are about the same object. Now it is possible to <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of another's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, else <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> would have no reason for saying (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi) that we should not <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a> of anyone so long as he lives. Therefore one can also hope for another's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Enchiridion viii) that "hope is only of such things as belong to him who is supposed to hope for them."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> We can hope for something in two ways: first, absolutely, and thus the object of hope is always something arduous and pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who hopes. Secondly, we can hope for something, through something else being presupposed, and in this way its object can be something pertaining to someone else. On order to explain this we must observe that love and hope differ in this, that love denotes union between lover and beloved, while hope denotes a movement or a stretching forth of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> towards an arduous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now union is of things that are distinct, wherefore love can directly regard the other whom a man unites to himself by love, looking upon him as his other self: whereas movement is always towards its own term which is proportionate to the subject moved. Therefore hope regards directly one's own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and not that which pertains to another. Yet if we presuppose the union of love with another, a man can hope for and desire something for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as for himself; and, accordingly, he can hope for another <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal's</a> life, inasmuch as he is united to him by love, and just as it is the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whereby a man loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, himself, and his neighbor, so too it is the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of hope, whereby a man hopes for himself and for another.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether a man can lawfully hope in man?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It wold seem that one may lawfully hope in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the object of hope is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Now we are helped to obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by the patronage of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Dial. i, 8) that "<a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is furthered by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>' <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>." Therefore one may hope in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, if a man may not hope in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it ought not to be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a man, that one should not be able to hope in him. Yet this is reckoned a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in some, as appears from <a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse4">Jeremiah 9:4</a>: "Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take heed of his neighbor, and let him not trust in any brother of his." Therefore it is lawful to trust in a man.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is the expression of hope, as stated above (2, Objection 2). But it is lawful to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to a man for something. Therefore it is lawful to trust in him.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah 17:5</a>): "<a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that trusteth in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Hope, as stated above (1; I-II, 40, 7), regards two things, viz. the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which it intends to obtain, and the help by which that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is obtained. Now the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which a man hopes to obtain, has the aspect of a final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, while the help by which one hopes to obtain that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, has the character of an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Now in each of these kinds of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we find a principal and a secondary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the principal end is the last end, while the secondary end is that which is referred to an end. On like manner the principal efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the first agent, while the secondary efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the secondary and instrumental agent. Now hope regards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as its last end, and the Divine assistance as the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> leading to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>Accordingly, just as it is not lawful to hope for any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as one's last end, but only as something referred to final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so too, it is unlawful to hope in any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or any creature, as though it were the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of movement towards <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is, however, lawful to hope in a man or a creature as being the secondary and instrumental agent through whom one is helped to obtain any goods that are ordained to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is in this way that we turn to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and that we ask men also for certain things; and for this reason some are blamed in that they cannot be trusted to give help.

<p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether hope is a theological virtue?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one that has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object. Now hope has for its object not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also other goods which we hope to obtain from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore hope is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not a mean between two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as stated above (I-II, 64, 4). But hope is a mean between presumption and <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>. Therefore hope is not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, expectation belongs to longanimity which is a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Since, then, hope is a kind of expectation, it seems that hope is not a theological, but a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, the object of hope is something arduous. But it belongs to magnanimity, which is a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to tend to the arduous. Therefore hope is a moral, and not a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Hope is enumerated (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>) together with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which are theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since specific differences, by their very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, divide a genus, in order to decide under what division we must place hope, we must observe whence it derives its character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Now it has been stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>) that hope has the character of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from the fact that it attains the supreme rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions: and this it attains both as its first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in as much as it leans on its assistance, and as its last final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in as much as it expects <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the enjoyment thereof. Hence it is evident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the principal object of hope, considered as a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Since, then, the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is one that has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for its object, as stated above (I-II, 62, 1), it is evident that hope is a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Whatever else hope expects to obtain, it hopes for it in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the last end, or as the first efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (<a href="#4">Article 4</a>).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things measured and ruled the mean consists in the measure or rule being attained; if we go beyond the rule, there is excess, if we fall short of the rule, there is deficiency. But in the rule or measure itself there is no such thing as a mean or extremes. Now a moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned with things ruled by reason, and these things are its proper object; wherefore it is proper to it to follow the mean as regards its proper object. On the other hand, a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is concerned with the First Rule not ruled by another rule, and that Rule is its proper object. Wherefore it is not proper for a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, with regard to its proper object, to follow the mean, although this may happen to it <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> with regard to something that is referred to its principal object. Thus <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can have no mean or extremes in the point of trusting to the First Truth, in which it is impossible to trust too much; whereas on the part of the things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, it may have a mean and extremes; for instance one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is a mean between two falsehoods. So too, hope has no mean or extremes, as regards its principal object, since it is impossible to trust too much in the Divine assistance; yet it may have a mean and extremes, as regards those things a man trusts to obtain, in so far as he either presumes above his capability, or despairs of things of which he is capable.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The expectation which is mentioned in the definition of hope does not imply delay, as does the expectation which belongs to longanimity. It implies a reference to the Divine assistance, whether that which we hope for be delayed or not.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Magnanimity tends to something arduous in the hope of obtaining something that is within one's power, wherefore its proper object is the doing of great things. On the other hand hope, as a theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, regards something arduous, to be obtained by another's help, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>).

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether hope is distinct from the other theological virtues?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope is not distinct from the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a> are distinguished by their objects, as stated above (I-II, 54, 2). Now the object of hope is the same as of the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore hope is not distinct from the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, in the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we make profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we say: "I expect the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> and the life of the world to come." Now expectation of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Therefore hope is not distinct from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by hope <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tends to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this belongs properly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore hope is not distinct from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> There cannot be number without distinction. Now hope is numbered with the other theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> says (Moral. i, 16) that the three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore hope is distinct from the theological <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be theological from having <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the object to which it adheres. Now one may adhere to a thing in two ways: first, for its own sake; secondly, because something else is attained thereby. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> makes us adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake, uniting our minds to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the emotion of love.

<p>On the other hand, hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to a principle wherefrom certain things accrue to us. Now we derive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the attainment of perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes us adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the source whence we derive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tells us is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: while hope makes us adhere to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the source whence we derive perfect <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, i.e. in so far as, by hope, we trust to the Divine assistance for obtaining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the object of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> under different aspects, as stated above: and a different aspect of the object suffices for the distinction of <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habits</a>, as stated above (I-II, 54, 2).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Expectation is mentioned in the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not as though it were the proper act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but because the act of hope presupposes the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as we shall state further on (7). Hence an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is expressed in the act of hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope makes us tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be obtained finally, and as to a helper strong to assist: whereas <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, properly speaking, makes us tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by uniting our affections to Him, so that we live, not for ourselves, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether hope precedes faith?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that hope precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> on <a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse3">Psalm 36:3</a>, "Trust in the Lord, and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>," says: "Hope is the entrance to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." But <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we are justified. Therefore hope precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is included in a definition should precede the thing defined and be more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But hope is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse1">Hebrews 11:1</a>): "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of things to be hoped for." Therefore hope precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, hope precedes a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act, for the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>): "He that plougheth should plough in hope . . . to receive fruit." But the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a>. Therefore hope precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse2">Matthew 1:2</a>): "<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>," i.e. "<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> begot hope," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes hope. For the object of hope is a future <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, arduous but possible to obtain. In order, therefore, that we may hope, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the object of hope to be proposed to us as possible. Now the object of hope is, in one way, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and in another way, the Divine assistance, as explained above (2; 6, ad 3): and both of these are proposed to us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are able to obtain <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal life</a>, and that for this purpose the Divine assistance is ready for us, according to <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>: "He that cometh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him." Therefore it is evident that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes hope.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As the same <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> observes further on, "hope" is called "the entrance" to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, i.e. of the thing <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, because by hope we enter in to see what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Or we may reply that it is called the "entrance to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," because thereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> begins to be established and perfected in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The thing to be hoped for is included in the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the proper object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is something not apparent in itself. Hence it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to express it in a circumlocution by something resulting from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Hope does not precede every <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">meritorious</a> act; but it suffices for it to accompany or follow it.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether charity precedes hope?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes hope. For <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> says on <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse6">Luke 17:6</a>, "If you had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like to a grain of mustard seed," etc.: "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Charity</a> flows from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and hope from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes hope.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "<a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> emotions and affections proceed from love and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>." Now to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, considered as an act of hope, is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> emotion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Therefore it flows from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> says (Sent. iii, D, 26) that hope proceeds from <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, which precede not only the thing hoped for, but also hope itself, which, in the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, is preceded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> precedes hope.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 1:5</a>): "The end of the commandment is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> from a pure heart, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>," i.e. "from hope," according to a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. Therefore hope precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Order is twofold. One is the order of generation and of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, in respect of which the imperfect precedes the perfect: the other is the order of perfection and form, in respect of which the perfect <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the imperfect. On respect of the first order hope precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: and this is clear from the fact that hope and all movements of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> flow from love, as stated above (I-II, 27, 4; I-II, 28, 6, ad 2; I-II, 40, 7) in the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.

<p>Now there is a perfect, and an imperfect love. Perfect love is that whereby a man is loved in himself, as when someone wishes a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for his own sake; thus a man loves his friend. Imperfect love is that whereby a man love something, not for its own sake, but that he may obtain that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself; thus a man loves what he desires. The first love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pertains to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, which adheres to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake; while hope pertains to the second love, since he that hopes, intends to obtain possession of something for himself.

<p>Hence in the order of generation, hope precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. For just as a man is led to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through fear of being punished by Him for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> states (In primam canon. Joan. Tract. ix), so too, hope leads to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, in as much as a man through hoping to be rewarded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is encouraged to love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and obey His commandments. On the other hand, in the order of perfection <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes hope, wherefore, with the advent of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, hope is made more perfect, because we hope chiefly in our friends. It is in this sense that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> states (Objection 1) that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> flows from hope: so that this suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Hope and every movement of the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> proceed from some kind of love, whereby the expected <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is loved. But not every kind of hope proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, but only the movement of living hope, viz. that whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hopes to obtain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as from a friend.
