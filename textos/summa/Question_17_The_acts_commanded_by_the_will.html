<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether command is an act of the reason or of the will?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that command is not an act of the reason but of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For command is a kind of motion; because <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> says that there are four ways of moving, "by perfecting, by disposing, by commanding, and by counselling." But it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to move all the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1). Therefore command is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, just as to be commanded belongs to that which is subject, so, seemingly, to command belongs to that which is most free. But the root of liberty is especially in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore to command belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, command is followed at once by act. But the act of the reason is not followed at once by act: for he who judges that a thing should be done, does not do it at once. Therefore command is not an act of the reason, but of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xvi.] and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (Ethic. i, 13) say that "the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> obeys reason." Therefore command is an act of the reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Command is an act of the reason presupposing, however, an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, we must take note that, since the acts of the reason and of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be brought to bear on one another, in so far as the reason reasons about willing, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills to reason, the result is that the act of the reason precedes the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and conversely. And since the power of the preceding act continues in the act that follows, it happens sometimes that there is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in so far as it retains in itself something of an act of the reason, as we have stated in reference to use and choice; and conversely, that there is an act of the reason in so far as it retains in itself something of an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.

<p>Now, command is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> indeed an act of the reason: for the commander orders the one commanded to do something, by way of intimation or declaration; and to order thus by intimating or declaring is an act of the reason. Now the reason can intimate or declare something in two ways. First, absolutely: and this intimation is expressed by a verb in the indicative mood, as when one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> says to another: "This is what you should do." Sometimes, however, the reason intimates something to a man by moving him thereto; and this intimation is expressed by a verb in the imperative mood; as when it is said to someone: "Do this." Now the first mover, among the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to the doing of an act is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (Question 9, Article 1). Since therefore the second mover does not move, save in virtue of the first mover, it follows that the very fact that the reason moves by commanding, is due to the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Consequently it follows that command is an act of the reason, presupposing an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in virtue of which the reason, by its command, moves (the power) to the execution of the act.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> To command is to move, not anyhow, but by intimating and declaring to another; and this is an act of the reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The root of liberty is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> as the subject thereof; but it is the reason as its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can tend freely towards various objects, precisely because the reason can have various perceptions of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> define the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> as being "a free judgment arising from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>," implying that reason is the root of liberty.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> This argument proves that command is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> not absolutely, but with a kind of motion as stated above.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether command belongs to irrational animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that command belongs to irrational animals. Because, according to <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, "the power that commands movement is the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>; and the power that executes movement is in the muscles and nerves." But both powers are in irrational animals. Therefore command is to be found in irrational animals.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> is that of one who receives commands. But the body is compared to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to his master, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2). Therefore the body is commanded by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even in irrational animals, since they are composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, by commanding, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has an impulse towards an action. But impulse to action is to be found in irrational animals, as <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22). Therefore command is to be found in irrational animals.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Command is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But in irrational animals there is no reason. Neither, therefore, is there command.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> To command is nothing else than to direct someone to do something, by a certain motion of intimation. Now to direct is the proper <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Wherefore it is impossible that irrational animals should command in any way, since they are devoid of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is said to command movement, in so far as it moves the commanding reason. But this is only in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. In irrational animals the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power is not, properly speaking, a commanding faculty, unless command be taken loosely for motion.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The body of the irrational animal is competent to obey; but its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not competent to command, because it is not competent to direct. Consequently there is no ratio there of commander and commanded; but only of mover and moved.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Impulse to action is in irrational animals otherwise than in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For the impulse of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to action arises from the directing reason; wherefore his impulse is one of command. On the other hand, the impulse of the irrational animal arises from <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>; because as soon as they apprehend the fitting or the unfitting, their <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is moved <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> to pursue or to avoid. Wherefore they are directed by another to act; and they themselves do not direct themselves to act. Consequently in them is impulse but not command.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether use precedes command?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that use precedes command. For command is an act of the reason presupposing an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). But, as we have already shown (16, 1), use is an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore use precedes command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, command is one of those things that are ordained to the end. But use is of those things that are ordained to the end. Therefore it seems that use precedes command.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, every act of a power moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is called use; because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> uses the other powers, as stated above (Question 16, Article 1). But command is an act of the reason as moved by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore command is a kind of use. Now the common precedes the proper. Therefore use precedes command.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that impulse to action precedes use. But impulse to operation is given by command. Therefore command precedes use.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> use of that which is directed to the end, in so far as it is in the reason referring this to the end, precedes choice, as stated above (Question 16, Article 4). Wherefore still more does it precede command. On the other hand, use of that which is directed to the end, in so far as it is subject to the executive power, follows command; because use in the user is united to the act of the thing used; for one does not use a stick before doing something with the stick. But command is not simultaneous with the act of the thing to which the command is given: for it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes its fulfilment, sometimes, indeed, by priority of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Consequently it is evident that command precedes use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> Not every act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> precedes this act of the reason which is command; but an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> precedes, viz. choice; and an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> follows, viz. use. Because after counsel's decision, which is reason's judgment, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> chooses; and after choice, the reason commands that power which has to do what was chosen; and then, last of all, someone's will begins to use, by executing the command of reason; sometimes it is another's will, when one commands another; sometimes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one that commands, when he commands himself to do something.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as act ranks before power, so does the object rank before the act. Now the object of use is that which is directed to the end. Consequently, from the fact that command precedes, rather than that it follows use.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Just as the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in using the reason for the purpose of command, precedes the command; so also we may say that this act whereby the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> uses the reason, is preceded by a command of reason; since the acts of these powers react on one another.

<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Whether command and the commanded act are one act, or distinct?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the commanded act is not one with the command itself. For the acts of different powers are themselves distinct. But the commanded act belongs to one power, and the command to another; since one is the power that commands, and the other is the power that receives the command. Therefore the commanded act is not one with the command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, whatever things can be separate from one another, are distinct: for nothing is severed from itself. But sometimes the commanded act is separate from the command: for sometimes the command is given, and the commanded act follows not. Therefore command is a distinct act from the act commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, whatever things are related to one another as precedent and consequent, are distinct. But command <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> precedes the commanded act. Therefore they are distinct.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Topic. iii, 2) that "where one thing is by reason of another, there is but one." But there is no commanded act unless by reason of the command. Therefore they are one.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Nothing prevents certain things being distinct in one respect, and one in another respect. Indeed, every multitude is one in some respect, as <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius</a> says (Div. Nom. xiii). But a difference is to be observed in this, that some are simply many, and one in a particular aspect: while with others it is the reverse. Now "one" is predicated in the same way as "being." And <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is being simply, whereas <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a> or being "of reason" is a being only in a certain respect. Wherefore those things that are one in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> are one simply, though many in a certain respect. Thus, in the genus <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the whole composed of its integral or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> parts, is one simply: because the whole is being and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> simply, and the parts are being and <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> in the whole. But those things which are distinct in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, and one according to an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, are distinct simply, and one in a certain respect: thus many men are one people, and many stones are one heap; which is unity of composition or order. In like manner also many <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> that are one in genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> are many simply, and one in a certain respect: since to be one in genus or <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> is to be one according to the consideration of the reason.

<p>Now just as in the genus of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> things, a whole is composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> (e.g. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is one <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> being, though he has many parts, is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body); so, in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the act of a lower power is in the position of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in regard to the act of a higher power, in so far as the lower power acts in virtue of the higher power moving it: for thus also the act of the first mover is as the form in regard to the act of its instrument. Hence it is evident that command and the commanded act are one <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>, just as a whole is one, yet in its parts, many.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> If the distinct powers are not ordained to one another, their acts are diverse simply. But when one power is the mover of the other, then their acts are, in a way, one: since "the act of the mover and the act of the thing moved are one act" (Phys. iii, 3).

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The fact that command and the commanded act can be separated from one another shows that they are different parts. Because the parts of a man can be separated from one another, and yet they form one whole.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> In those things that are many in parts, but one as a whole, nothing hinders one part from preceding another. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in a way, precedes the body; and the heart, the other members.

<h2 id="article5">Article 5. Whether the act of the will is commanded?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not commanded. For <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 9): "The mind commands the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to will, and yet it does not." But to <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, to receive a command belongs to one who can understand the command. But the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> cannot understand the command; for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to which it belongs to understand. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, if one act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is commanded, for the same reason all are commanded. But if all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are commanded, we must needs proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>; because the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> precedes the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> commanding, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>); for if that act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be also commanded, this command will be precedes by another act of the reason, and so on to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. But to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> is not possible. Therefore the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not commanded.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> Whatever is in our power, is subject to our command. But the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, most of all, are in our power; since all our acts are said to be in our power, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Therefore the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> are commanded by us.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>), command is nothing else than the act of the reason directing, with a certain motion, something to act. Now it is evident that the reason can direct the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for just as it can judge it to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to will something, so it can direct by commanding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to will. From this it is evident that an act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> can be commanded.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 9) when the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> commands itself perfectly to will, then already it wills: but that sometimes it commands and wills not, is due to the fact that it commands imperfectly. Now imperfect command arises from the fact that the reason is moved by opposite motives to command or not to command: wherefore it fluctuates between the two, and fails to command perfectly.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> Just as each of the members of the body works not for itself alone but for the whole body; thus it is for the whole body that the eye sees; so is it with the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> understands, not for itself alone, but for all the powers; and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> wills not only for itself, but for all the powers too. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in so far as he is endowed with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, commands the act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> for himself.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since command is an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that act is commanded which is subject to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. Now the first act of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not due to the direction of the reason but to the instigation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or of a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as stated above (Question 9, Article 4). Therefore there is no need to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>.

<h2 id="article6">Article 6. Whether the act of the reason is commanded?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of the reason cannot be commanded. For it seems impossible for a thing to command itself. But it is the reason that commands, as stated above (<a href="#1">Article 1</a>). Therefore the act of the reason is not commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, that which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> is different from that which is by participation. But the power whose act is commanded by reason, is rational by participation, as stated in Ethic. i, 13. Therefore the act of that power, which is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> rational, is not commanded.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, that act is commanded, which is in our power. But to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, is not always in our power. Therefore the act of the reason cannot be commanded.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> That which we do of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, can be done by our command. But the acts of the reason are accomplished through the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: for <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> inquires, considers, judges, approves." Therefore the acts of the reason can be commanded.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Since the reason reacts on itself, just as it directs the acts of other powers, so can it direct its own act. Consequently its act can be commanded.

<p>But we must take note that the act of the reason may be considered in two ways. First, as to the exercise of the act. And considered thus, the act of the reason can always be commanded: as when one is told to be attentive, and to use one's reason. Secondly, as to the object; in respect of which two acts of the reason have to be noticed. One is the act whereby it apprehends the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about something. This act is not in our power: because it happens in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> or <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light. Consequently in this respect, the act of the reason is not in our power, and cannot be commanded. The other act of the reason is that whereby it assents to what it apprehends. If, therefore, that which the reason apprehends is such that it <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> assents thereto, e.g. the first principles, it is not in our power to assent or dissent to the like: assent follows <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>, and consequently, properly speaking, is not subject to our command. But some things which are apprehended do not convince the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to such an extent as not to leave it free to assent or dissent, or at least suspend its assent or dissent, on account of some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or other; and in such things assent or dissent is in our power, and is subject to our command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> commands itself, just as the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> moves itself, as stated above (Question 9, Article 3), that is to say, in so far as each power reacts on its own acts, and from one thing tends to another.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> On account of the diversity of objects subject to the act of the reason, nothing prevents the reason from participating in itself: thus the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles is participated in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the conclusions.

<p>The reply to the third object is evident from what has been said.

<h2 id="article7">Article 7. Whether the act of the sensitive appetite is commanded?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not commanded. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> says (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse15">Romans 7:15</a>): "For I do not that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which I will": and a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a> explains this by saying that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lusts, although he wills not to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. But to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is an act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not subject to our command.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, corporeal <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> obeys <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, to the effect of formal transmutation, as was shown in the I, 65, 4; I, 91, 02; I, 110, 2. But the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is accompanied by a formal transmutation of the body, consisting in heat or cold. Therefore the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> command.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the proper motive principle of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is something apprehended by sense or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. But it is not always in our power to apprehend something by sense or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Therefore the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is not subject to our command.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xvi.] says: "That which obeys reason is twofold, the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> and the irascible," which belong to the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. Therefore the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to the command of reason.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> An act is subject to our command, in so far as it is in our power, as stated above (<a href="#5">Article 5</a>). Consequently in order to understand in what manner the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, we must consider in what manner it is in our power. Now it must be observed that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> differs from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in the fact that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is a power of a corporeal organ, whereas the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not. Again, every act of a power that uses a corporeal organ, depends not only on a power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also on the disposition of that corporeal organ: thus the act of vision depends on the power of sight, and on the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the eye, which <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is a help or a hindrance to that act. Consequently the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> depends not only on the <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetitive</a> power, but also on the disposition of the body.

<p>Now whatever part the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes in the act, follows apprehension. And the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, being a particular apprehension, is regulated by the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, which is universal; just as a particular active power is regulated by a universal active power. Consequently in this respect the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is subject to the command of reason. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> or disposition of the body is not subject to the command of reason: and consequently in this respect, the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is hindered from being wholly subject to the command of reason.

<p>Moreover it happens sometimes that the movement of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is aroused suddenly in consequence of an apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of sense. And then such movement occurs without the command of reason: although reason could have prevented it, had it foreseen. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says (Polit. i, 2) that the reason governs the irascible and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscible</a> not by a "despotic supremacy," which is that of a master over his <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a>; but by a "politic and royal supremacy," whereby the free are governed, who are not wholly subject to command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lusts, although he wills not to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, is due to a disposition of the body, whereby the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is hindered from perfect compliance with the command of reason. Hence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> adds (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse15">Romans 7:15</a>): "I see another <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in my members, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind." This may also happen through a sudden movement of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the body stands in a twofold relation to the act of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. First, as preceding it: thus a man may be disposed in one way or another, in respect of his body, to this or that passion. Secondly, as consequent to it: thus a man becomes heated through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that precedes, is not subject to the command of reason: since it is due either to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, or to some previous movement, which cannot cease at once. But the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> that is consequent, follows the command of reason: since it results from the local movement of the heart, which has various movements according to the various acts of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Since the external sensible is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the apprehension of the senses, it is not in our power to apprehend anything by the senses, unless the sensible be present; which presence of the sensible is not always in our power. For it is then that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can use his senses if he will so to do; unless there be some obstacle on the part of the organ. On the other hand, the apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> is subject to the ordering of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, in proportion to the strength or weakness of the imaginative power. For that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is unable to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the things that reason considers, is either because they cannot be <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a>, such as incorporeal things; or because of the weakness of the imaginative power, due to some organic indisposition.

<h2 id="article8">Article 8. Whether the act of the vegetal soul is commanded?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the acts of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are subject to the command of reason. For the sensitive powers are of higher rank than the vegetal powers. But the powers of the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are subject to the command of reason. Much more, therefore, are the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is called a "little world" [<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Phys. viii. 2, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the body, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the world. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in the world in such a way, that everything in the world obeys His command. Therefore all that is in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, obey the command of reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, praise and blame are awarded only to such acts as are subject to the command of reason. But in the acts of the nutritive and generative power, there is room for praise and blame, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: as in the case of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and their contrary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Therefore the acts of these powers are subject to the command of reason.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii.] sats that "the nutritive and generative power is one over which the reason has no control."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Some acts proceed from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, others from the animal, or from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>: for every agent desires an end in some way. Now the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> does not follow from some apprehension, as to the animal and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. But the reason commands by way of apprehensive power. Wherefore those acts that proceed from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellective</a> or the animal <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, can be commanded by reason: but not those acts that proceed from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>. And such are the acts of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; wherefore <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii) says "that generation and nutrition belong to what are called <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers." Consequently the acts of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not subject to the command of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The more immaterial an act is, the more noble it is, and the more is it subject to the command of reason. Hence the very fact that the acts of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not obey reason, shows that they rank lowest.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> The comparison holds in a certain respect: because, to wit, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves the world, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moves the body. But it does not hold in every respect: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did not create the body out of nothing, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> the world; for which reason the world is wholly subject to His command.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> Virtue and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, praise and blame do not affect the acts themselves of the nutritive and generative power, i.e. digestion, and formation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; but they affect the acts of the sensitive part, that are ordained to the acts of generation and nutrition; for example the desire for pleasure in the act of taking food or in the act of generation, and the right or wrong use thereof.

<h2 id="article9">Article 9. Whether the acts of the external members are commanded?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the members of the body do not obey reason as to their acts. For it is evident that the members of the body are more distant from the reason, than the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> do not obey reason, as stated above (<a href="#8">Article 8</a>). Therefore much less do the members of the body obey.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the heart is the principle of animal movement. But the movement of the heart is not subject to the command of reason: for <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> [Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii.] says that "the pulse is not controlled by reason." Therefore the movement of the bodily members is not subject to the command of reason.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 16) that "the movement of the genital members is sometimes inopportune and not desired; sometimes when sought it fails, and whereas the heart is warm with desire, the body remains cold." Therefore the movements of the members are not obedient to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (Confess. viii, 9): "The mind commands a movement of the hand, and so ready is the hand to obey, that scarcely can one discern obedience from command."

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> The members of the body are organs of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> powers. Consequently according as the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stand in respect of obedience to reason, so do the members of the body stand in respect thereof. Since then the sensitive powers are subject to the command of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, whereas the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers are not; therefore all movements of members, that are moved by the sensitive powers, are subject to the command of reason; whereas those movements of members, that arise from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> powers, are not subject to the command of reason.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The members do not move themselves, but are moved through the powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; of which powers, some are in closer contact with the reason than are the powers of the vegetal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> In things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, that which is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> stands first, whence all other things are derived: thus from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of principles that are <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is derived <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the conclusions; and from volition of the end <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a> desired, is derived the choice of the means. So also in bodily movements the principle is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Now the principle of bodily movements begins with the movement of the heart. Consequently the movement of the heart is according to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and not according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>: for like a proper <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, it results from life, which follows from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. Thus the movement of heavy and light things results from their <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> form: for which reason they are said to be moved by their generator, as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> states (Phys. viii, 4). Wherefore this movement is called "vital." For which reason <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii) says that, just as the movement of generation and nutrition does not obey reason, so neither does the pulse which is a vital movement. By the pulse he means the movement of the heart which is indicated by the pulse veins.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 17,20) it is in punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that the movement of these members does not obey reason: in this sense, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished for its rebellion against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the insubmission of that member whereby <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is transmitted to posterity.

<p>But because, as we shall state later on, the effect of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parent</a> was that his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was left to itself, through the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had bestowed on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we must consider the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this particular member's insubmission to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. This is stated by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De Causis Mot. Animal.) who says that "the movements of the heart and of the organs of generation are involuntary," and that the reason of this is as follows. These members are stirred at the occasion of some apprehension; in so far as the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> represent such things as arouse the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> these movements are a consequence. But they are not moved at the command of the reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because these movements are conditioned by a certain <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> change of heat and cold, which change is not subject to the command of reason. This is the case with these two organs in particular, because each is as it were a separate animal being, in so far as it is a principle of life; and the principle is virtually the whole. For the heart is the principle of the senses; and from the organ of generation proceeds the seminal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is virtually the entire animal. Consequently they have their proper movements <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">naturally</a>: because principles must needs be <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a>, as stated above (Reply to Objection 2).
