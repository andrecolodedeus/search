<h1>Question 17. The power of the keys</h1>

<ol><li><a href="../summa/5017.htm#article1"> Should there be keys in the Church?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5017.htm#article2"> Is the key the power of binding and loosing, etc.?</a> <li><a href="../summa/5017.htm#article3"> Are there two keys or only one?</a> </ol>

<h2 id="article1">Article 1. Whether there should be keys in the Church?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there is no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for keys in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For there is no need for keys that one may enter a house the door of which is open. But it is written (<a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse1">Apocalypse 4:1</a>): "I looked and behold a door was opened in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>," which door is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for He said of Himself (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse7">John 10:7</a>): "I am the door." Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> needs no keys for the entrance into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, a key is needed for opening and shutting. But this belongs to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone, "Who openeth and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shutteth, shutteth and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> openeth" (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse7">Apocalypse 3:7</a>). Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has no keys in the hands of her ministers.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is opened to whomever <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is closed, and vice versa. Therefore whoever has the keys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, has the keys of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not said to have the keys of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Therefore neither has she the keys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> It is written (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>): "To thee will I give the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>."

<p>Further, every dispenser should have the keys of the things that he dispenses. But the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are the dispensers of the divine mysteries, as appears from <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>. Therefore they ought to have the keys.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> In material things a key is an instrument for opening a door. Now the door of the kingdom is closed to us through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, both as to the stain and as to the debt of punishment. Wherefore the power of removing this obstacle is called a key. Now this power is in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Divine Trinity</a> by authority; hence some say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has the key of "authority." But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Man had the power to remove the above obstacle, through the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, which also is said to open the door; hence some say that He has the keys of "excellence." And since "the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built, flowed from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> while He lay asleep on the cross" [Augustine, Enarr. in Ps. 138], the efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> abides in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Wherefore a certain power for the removal of the aforesaid obstacle is bestowed on the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, not by their own, but by a Divine power and by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. This power is called metaphorically the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> key, and is the key of "ministry."

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The door of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, considered in itself, is ever open, but it is said to be closed to someone, on account of some obstacle against entering therein, which is in himself. The obstacle which the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> inherited from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was removed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; hence, after the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, John saw an opened door in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Yet that door still remains closed to this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which he has contracted, or the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he has committed: hence we need the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> This refers to His closing <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">Limbo</a>, so that thenceforth no one should go there, and to His opening of Paradise, the obstacle of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being removed by His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The key whereby <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is opened and closed, is the power of bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is opened to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that he is taken out from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is the door of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and closed, so that by the help of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should no more fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the power of bestowing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, wherefore He kept this key to Himself. But the key of the kingdom is also the power to remit the debt of temporal punishment, which debt prevents <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from entering the kingdom Consequently the key of the kingdom can be given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rather than the key of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, for they are not the same, as is clear from what has been said. For a man may be set free from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> by the remission of the debt of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>, without being at once admitted to the kingdom, on account of his yet owing a debt of temporal punishment.

<p>It may also be replied, as some state, that the key of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is also the key of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, since if one is opened to a man, the other, for that very reason, is closed to him, but it takes its name from the better of the two.

<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Whether the key is the power of binding and loosing, etc.?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that the key is not the power of binding and loosing, whereby "the ecclesiastical judge has to admit the worthy to the kingdom and exclude the unworthy" therefrom, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 16). For the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power conferred in a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is the same as the character. But the key and the character do not seem to be the same, since by the character <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas by the key he is referred to his subjects. Therefore the key is not a power.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, an ecclesiastical judge is only one who has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which is not given at the same time as orders. But the keys are given in the conferring of orders. Therefore there should have been no mention of the ecclesiastical judge in the definition of the keys.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, when a man has something of himself, he needs not to be reduced to act by some active power. Now a man is admitted to the kingdom from the very fact that he is worthy. Therefore it does not concern the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> to admit the worthy to the kingdom.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> Further, sinners are unworthy of the kingdom. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for sinners, that they may go to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore she does not exclude the unworthy, but admits them, so far as she is concerned.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, in every ordered series of agents, the last end belongs to the principal and not to the instrumental agent. But the principal agent in view of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore admission to the kingdom, which is the last end, belongs to Him, and not to those who have the keys, who are as instrumental or ministerial agents.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> According to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> (De Anima ii, text. 33), "powers are defined from their acts." Wherefore, since the key is a kind of power, it should be defined from its act or use, and reference to the act should include its object from which it takes its <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a>, and the mode of acting whereby the power is shown to be well-ordered. Now the act of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is to open <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not absolutely, since it is already open, as stated above (1, ad 1), but for this or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and this cannot be done in an orderly manner without due consideration of the worthiness of the one to be admitted to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Hence the aforesaid definition of the key gives the genus, viz. "power," the subject of the power, viz. the "ecclesiastical judge," and the act, viz. "of excluding or admitting," corresponding to the two acts of a material key which are to open and shut; the object of which act is referred to in the words "from the kingdom," and the mode, in the words, "worthy" and "unworthy," because account is taken of the worthiness or unworthiness of those on whom the act is exercised.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> The same power is directed to two things, of which one is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other, as heat, in fire, is directed to make a thing hot and to melt it. And since every <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and remission in a <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body</a> comes to it from its head, it seems that it is <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a> the same power whereby a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and whereby he can loose and bind, if he has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and that there is only a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> difference, according as it is referred to different effects, even as fire in one respect is said to have the power of heating, and in another, the power of melting. And because the character of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order is nothing else than the power of exercising that act to which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order is chiefly ordained (if we maintain that it is the same as a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power), therefore the character, the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> are one and the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essentially</a>, but differ <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> All <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> power is conferred by some kind of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Therefore the key is given together with the order: yet the use of the key requires due <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, i.e. a people subject through <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, so that until he has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has the keys, but he cannot exercise the act of the keys. And since the key is defined from its act, its definition contains a reference to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be worthy to have something in two ways, either so as to have a right to possess it, and thus whoever is worthy has <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> already opened to him--or so that it is meet that he should receive it, and thus the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> admits those who are worthy, but to whom <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not yet altogether opened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hardens not by imparting <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but by withholding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is said to exclude, not as though he placed an obstacle to entrance, but because he does not remove an obstacle which is there, since he cannot remove it unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has already removed it. [<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> here follows the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, and replies in the negative. Later in life he altered his opinion. Cf. III, 62, 1; III, 64, 1; III, 86, 6.] Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that He may <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a>, so that there may be room for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> act does not bear immediately on the kingdom, but on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, by means of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wins to the kingdom.

<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Whether there are two keys or only one?</h2>

<p><strong>Objection 1.</strong> It would seem that there are not two keys but only one. For one lock requires but one key. Now the lock for the removal of which the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are required, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not require two keys for one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Objection 2.</strong> Further, the keys are given when orders are conferred. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not always due to infusion, but sometimes is acquired, nor is it possessed by all those who are ordained, and is possessed by some who are not ordained. Therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not a key, so that there is but one key, viz. the power of judging.

<p><strong>Objection 3.</strong> Further, the power which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has over the <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystic body of Christ</a> flows from the power which he has over <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body. Now the power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body is but one. Therefore the power which regards <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystic body</a> is but one. But this is a key. Therefore, etc.

<p><strong>Objection 4.</strong> On the other hand, It seems that there are more than two keys. For just as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power are requisite for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to act, so is will. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of discretion is reckoned as a key, and so is the power of judging. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> should be counted as a key.

<p><strong>Objection 5.</strong> Further, all three Divine Persons remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, through the keys, is the minister for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore he should have three keys, so that he may be conformed to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p><strong>I answer that,</strong> Whenever an act requires fitness on the part of the recipient, two things are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the one who has to perform the act, viz. judgment of the fitness of the recipient, and accomplishment of the act. Therefore in the act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby a man is given what he deserves, there needs to be a judgment in order to discern whether he deserves to receive. Again, an authority or power is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for both these things, for we cannot give save what we have in our power; nor can there be judgment, without the right to enforce it, since judgment is determined to one particular thing, which determination it derives, in speculative matters, from the first principles which cannot be gainsaid, and, in practical matters, from the power of command vested in the one who judges. And since the act of the key requires fitness in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on whom it is exercised--because the ecclesiastical judge, by means of the key, "admits the worthy and excludes the unworthy," as may be seen from the definition given above (<a href="#2">Article 2</a>)--therefore the judge requires both judgment of discretion whereby he judges a man to be worthy, and also the very act of receiving (that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> confession); and for both these things a certain power or authority is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Accordingly we may distinguish two keys, the first of which regards the judgment about the worthiness of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a>, while the other regards the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p>These two keys are distinct, not in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of authority, since both belong to the minister by virtue of his office, but in comparison with their respective acts, one of which presupposes the other.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 1.</strong> One key is ordained immediately to the opening of one lock, but it is not unfitting that one key should be ordained to the act of another. Thus it is in the case in point. For it is the second key, which is the power of binding and loosing, that opens the lock of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> immediately, but the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shows to whom that lock should be opened.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 2.</strong> There are two opinions about the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For some say that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> considered as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, acquired or infused, is the key in this case, and that it is not the principal key, but is called a key through being subordinate to another key: so that it is not called a key when the other key is wanting, for instance, in an educated <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. And although <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> lack this key at times, through being without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, acquired or infused, of loosing and binding, yet sometimes they make use of their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> endeavors, which they who hold this opinion call a little key, so that although <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be not bestowed together with orders, yet with the conferring of orders the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> becomes a key which it was not before. This seems to have been the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master</a> (Sent. iv, D, 19).

<p>But this does not seem to agree with the words of the Gospel, whereby the keys are promised to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew 16:19</a>), so that not only one but two are given in orders. For which reason the other opinion holds that the key is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> considered as a <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a>, but the authority to exercise the act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which authority is sometimes without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is sometimes present without the authority. This may be seen even in secular courts, for a secular judge may have the authority to judge, without having the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, while another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on the contrary, has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> without having the authority to judge. And since the act of judging to which a man is bound through the authority which is vested in him, and not through his <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, cannot be well performed without both of the above, the authority to judge, which is the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, cannot be accepted without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by one who lacks <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> void of authority can be possessed without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 3.</strong> The power of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> is directed to only one act of another kind, wherefore it is not numbered among the keys, nor is it multiplied as the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, which is directed to different acts, although as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of power and authority it is but one, as stated above.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 4.</strong> Everyone is free to will, so that no one needs authority to will; wherefore <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not reckoned as a key.

<p><strong>Reply to Objection 5.</strong> All three Persons remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the same way as one Person, wherefore there is no need for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who is the minister of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, to have three keys: and all the more, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which is appropriated to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, requires no key, as stated above (ad 4).
